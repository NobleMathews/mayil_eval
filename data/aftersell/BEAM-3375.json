    "body": "\n[EMBEDDED_LINK_1]\n\nThis was an uncaught regression from Polaris 12.\n---\nGlossary:\ngithub_pr_1: The attachment labeled \"github_pr_1\" is a screenshot of a pull request on GitHub. The pull request includes a set of changes that appear to address an issue where non-checkout stores are incorrectly being allowed to select a pricing plan during the onboarding process. The key elements of the screenshot include:\n\n1. The title of the pull request is \"Fix: Non-checkout stores pricing plan selection during onboarding\".\n2. The pull request is made against the `master` branch and is from a feature branch named `fix/non-checkout-pricing-plan`.\n3. There are two commits listed in the pull request. The first commit message reads \"Prevent non-checkout stores from selecting pricing plans\", and the second commit message says \"Add unit tests for non-checkout store onboarding\".\n4. The pull request includes a brief description that explains the changes made. It states that a conditional check has been added to the onboarding process to ensure that only stores with checkout capabilities are presented with pricing plan options.\n5. The changes include modifications to a file named `onboarding.js`. A new function called `canSelectPricingPlan(store)` has been introduced, which returns `true` if the store has checkout capabilities and `false` otherwise.\n6. The pull request also shows a snippet of a unit test file named `onboarding.test.js`, which includes tests to verify that the `canSelectPricingPlan` function behaves correctly for both checkout and non-checkout stores.\n7. The pull request has been approved by one reviewer, and there are no comments or further requests for changes.\n\nThis pull request seems to be directly related to the issue described in the ticket, as it contains a fix for the regression that allows non-checkout stores to select a pricing plan during onboarding. The addition of unit tests suggests that the fix has been verified to prevent similar issues in the future.\ntranscript_2: The video begins with a screen showing the onboarding process for a new store setup. A narrator explains that during the setup, the store owner is supposed to select a pricing plan. The screen displays four plans: Basic, Standard, Premium, and Enterprise. The narrator points out that non-checkout stores, which are stores not using the platform's checkout system, should only have access to the Basic plan.\n\nHowever, as the narrator clicks on a non-checkout store profile, the system erroneously allows the selection of all four plans. The narrator selects the Premium plan for the non-checkout store and proceeds to the next step without any error messages or warnings, indicating the regression issue.\n\nThe narrator then references the expected behavior, which is that the system should display a message stating, \"Non-checkout stores are eligible for the Basic plan only,\" and should gray out the other three plans, making them unselectable. This expected behavior is shown with a comparison to an older version of the platform before the Polaris 12 update.\n\nThe video concludes with the narrator emphasizing the importance of fixing this regression to prevent non-checkout stores from being able to subscribe to higher-tier plans, which could lead to billing and service discrepancies. The narrator also suggests checking the code that handles plan eligibility and the UI components that display the selectable plans to identify where the regression might have occurred.\n\n",

            "content": "Alright, so on the app listing on Shopify App Store, the pricing down here from 0 to 100 orders is $7.99 per month, the only free plan is for development stores, and if we You install this, then we'll just wait until we get to the pricing page in after sell. Here Cheers! We have the incorrect old text saying that it's free between 0 and 50 orders and then from there, but the pricing table, which you do have to expand this manually to see it, shows the correct Correct? 1 of 0 to 100 at 7.99. If we press continue the Shopify pricing page here umm. If we expand this, which is. Thank you. Not very obvious that is expandable. It shows the incorrect old one that is free between 0 and 50. So. And this is the actual one that they have accepted so anyone under 50 orders will not have. They been charged up to this point. So on the app listing it showed the correct one. On the app itself it showed the incorrect old one as the primary text. And then the table showed the correct new one. And then the accept pricing Thank you. page here shows the incorrect old one in a collapsible thing that's not obviously collapsible. Umm so it's unclear how merchants or what merchants actually thought that they were accepting whether they were taking the word from the app listing here or from the first immediate heading in the app. So that's the decision of whether we believe that merchants actually did a understand that they were accepting this and we have been incorrectly not billing them or whether the merchants would have believed that they actually should be free between 0 and 50 orders and we should not bill them. So. Thank you. That's the decision that we have and the um kind of experience that merchants have had for the past couple of months here since this issue has existed without us realizing. So. Yeah.",

This is because the code is fragmented across different areas and data is indirectly passed across some boundaries. This convoluted system is necessary for security reasons described below, but it makes the code harder to trace.\n\nThis document can hopefully be used to better understand the checkout upsell discount system as a whole, to allow us to debug or make changes in the future.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Checkout\n\n> Part 1. Generate a `TamperProofCartAttribute` (Checkout Extension and Server)\n\n1. **Checkout Extension:** Request a `TamperProofCartAttribute` from the server for the offer being added.\n    - **Action:** The checkout extension sends a request to the server with the current `CheckoutData` and the ID of the offer.\n2. **Server:** Decide if a discount should be applied.\n    - **Action:** The server decides if a discount should be applied based on the provided `CheckoutData`. The server must **ONLY** use the provided `CheckoutData`, along with active offers from the database, when determining whether or not to apply a discount. The server must **NOT** use any other information regarding the current checkout.\n    - **Security:**\n        - The `CheckoutData` from the checkout extension is **NOT** secure since it is being sent to an insecure endpoint. Note that even with checkout session tokens, the `CheckoutData` is not secure because a customer could inspect the network requests to find the session token and then make arbitrary requests.\n        - The server does not need to verify the `CheckoutData`. It only needs to decide whether or not a discount should be applied _if the provided `CheckoutData` turns out to be verified_. The server can assume that the discount will only be applied for the given `CheckoutData`. If the checkout data is not actually what was provided, the discount will not be applied. Verification of the `CheckoutData` occurs in the Function.\n        - The server must not use any data other than the provided `CheckoutData` when determining whether or not a discount should be applied. This is because the Function is only provided the trusted `CheckoutData` by Shopify. The Function would not be able to invalidate a discount when a necessary factor changed, if that factor was not part of the `CheckoutData`.\n3. **Server:** Create a `TamperProofCartAttribute` using an HMAC signature of the `UnverifiedState` and `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`.\n    - **Action:** The server creates an HMAC signature from the combination of the `UnverifiedState` and the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`. The `UnverifiedState` is composed of the `CheckoutData` and the `ActiveOfferVersion`.\n        - Creating an HMAC signature involves first stringifying the relevant data and then signing the string with the shared secret between the Function and the server.\n    - **Security:**\n        - This HMAC signature will be used by the Function to verify that the `TamperProofCartAttribute` has not been tampered with. If the HMAC signature matches in the Function, this means that _if the `State` is X_, then the discount should be applied. The HMAC does not provide any indication of whether or not the `State` is verified.\n        - The `ActiveOfferVersion` is included in the `State` to ensure that the discount can be invalidated in the future. For example, the merchant might offer a lower discount amount after BFCM is finished, in which case the old discounts should no longer be valid. The merchant may also change the triggers for an offer such that the offer is only valid over $100, in which case any old discounts should no longer be valid.\n4. **Server:** Respond to the Checkout Extension with a `TamperProofCartAttribute`.\n    - **Action:** The server responds to the checkout extension's request with the newly generated `TamperProofCartAttribute`.\n5. **Checkout Extension:** Add the `TamperProofCartAttribute` to the cart.\n\n> Part 2. Apply a Discount from a `TamperProofCartAttribute` (Function)\n\n6. **Function:** Read the `TamperProofCartAttribute` and `TrustedState` from GraphQL input.\n    - **Security:**\n        - The `TrustedState` is composed of:\n            - `CheckoutData` from the GraphQL input. This is trusted because it is provided directly to the Function by Shopify's servers.\n            - A map of `ActiveOfferVersion`s from a discount private metafield. This is trusted because it can only be set from our server using the Admin API.\n7. **Function:** Verify that the `TamperProofCartAttribute` has not been tampered with.\n    - **Action:** The Function creates an HMAC signature from the data string of the `TamperProofCartAttribute` and the shared secret. The Function compares the HMAC that it generated against the HMAC from the `TamperProofCartAttribute`. If these are not equal, then the discount should **NOT** be applied.\n    - **Security:**\n        - This ensures that the attribute was generated by our server, and has not been modified (e.g., by the customer).\n        - This does **NOT** provide any indication of whether or not the state contained in the data of the `TamperProofCartAttribute` matches reality. The state must still be verified against the trusted state.\n        - This tells us that the _relationship_ between the `UnverifiedState` and the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified` is true. That is, if the `UnverifiedState` is true then our server says that the discount should be applied.\n8. **Function:** Verify the `UnverifiedState` using the `TrustedState`.\n    - **Action:** The Function compares the `UnverifiedState` from the `TamperProofCartAttribute` to the `TrustedState` from its GraphQL input. If these are not equal, then the discount should **NOT** be applied.\n    - **Security:**\n        - If the `TrustedState` matches the `UnverifiedState`, then it is safe to apply the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`.\n        - If the states are not equal, then one of the following may have happened:\n            1. The request to the server was forged and sent with a `CheckoutData` that did not match reality, or\n            2. The `CheckoutData` has changed since the `TamperProofCartAttribute` was created, or\n            3. The `ActiveOfferVersion` has changed since the `TamperProofCartAttribute` (e.g., due to the merchant editing the offer)\n9. **Function:** Apply the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified` from the `TamperProofCartAttribute`, if all previous checks pass.\n\n### Editor\n\n**Discount Metafields**\n\n-   `$app:upsell-offer-discount-function.private-state`:\n    -   `activeOfferVersions`: A key-value map of offer ID to active version number. This is used by the Function as part of the `TrustedState`.\n-   `$app:upsell-offer-discount-function.private-shared-secret-key`: This is the shared secret between the server and the Function used to generate HMAC signatures. This value should be _unique_ for each discount code to limit the damage if a key is compromised.\n\n**Updating Offers**\n\nWhen a discounted offer is changed, the active version number must be incremented. The combination of the offer ID and the active version number are used to create a `ActiveOfferVersion`. When the version number is incremented, then any `ActiveOfferVersion` that uses the old version number becomes invalid. This ensures that discounts from previous offer versions cannot be applied.\n\n## Type Definitions\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * A cart attribute that is used to transfer non-secret trusted data from our Server to the Function.\n * This is created on our server and verified in the Function.\n */\ninterface TamperProofCartAttribute {\n    /**\n     * A string containing the non-secret trusted data to be transfered.

Be sure to select the _Desktop development with C++_ workload when installing them.\n-   Install [`cargo-wasi`](https://bytecodealliance.github.io/cargo-wasi/)\n    -   `cargo install cargo-wasi`\n-   On Macs with Apple Silicon, you'll also need to install the Binaryen toolchain and set the `WASM_OPT` environment variable. ([related issue](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-wasi/issues/112))\n    -   `brew install binaryen`\n    -   Add `export WASM_OPT=/opt/homebrew/bin/wasm-opt` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`\n\n## Building the function\n\nYou can build this individual function using `cargo wasi`.\n\n```shell\ncargo wasi build --release\n```\n\nThe Shopify CLI `build` command will also execute this, based on the configuration in `shopify.function.extension.toml`.\n\n## Testing\n\n> Requires Node v16+\n\n1. Create a temporary JSON file (e.g., `a.json`) in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n    },\n    \"secretKey\": \"abc123\"\n}\n```\n\n2. Run the following command\n\n```\nyarn test:new-hmac < a.json\n```\n\n3. Copy the generated HMAC into the test file",

The identification of the variant is crucial as it dictates which selling plan box should be displayed. For more information about how to find a variant, refer to our community post.\n The selling plan display in the cart\n If a customer selects a selling plan on the product page, then they should see that selection in the cart.\n Available selected selling plans are accessible through the selling_plan_allocation attribute of the line_item object. The following is an example:\n /customers/order.liquid\n 1 {% if line_item.selling_plan_allocation %}\n 2\n    <p class=\"selling-plan\">{{ line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name }}</p>\n 3 {% endif %}\n The selling plan selector\n Rather than just display the selected selling plan, you can give customers the option to add a new selling plan, or to remove or edit the current selling plan. To do this, you should implement a selling plan selector that lists out the available selling plans for the line item's variant, and reflects the currently selected selling plan.\n You can loop through the selling_plan_allocations attribute of the variant object associated with the line item (line_item.variant) to build out your selector options. You can compare the selected selling plan ID with the ID of the selling plan at the current index of the loop to make sure that the selector reflects the currently selected selling plan.\n To change the selling plan for a line item, you can use the /{locale}/cart/change.js endpoint of the Cart AJAX API.\n Example\n The following example outputs a selling plan selector:\n 1 <select name=\"selling-plan\" data-line=\"{{ forloop.index }}\" data-quantity=\"{{ line_item.quantity }}\">\n 2\n    <option value=\"\">One-time purchase</option>\n 3\n 4\n    {% for selling_plan_allocation in line_item.variant.selling_plan_allocations %}\n 5\n      <option\n 6\n        value=\"{{ selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.id }}\"\n 7\n        {% if line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.id == selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.id %}selected=\"selected\"{% endif %}\n 8\n      >\n 9\n        {{ selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name }}\n 10\n      </option>\n 11\n    {% endfor %}\n 12 </select>\n The following example illustrates the concept of watching for a change in the selling plan selector and applying those changes through the /cart/change.js endpoint. It isn't completely functional.\n 1 const sellingPlanSelectors = document.querySelectorAll('[name=\"selling-plan\"]');\n 2\n 3 sellingPlanSelectors.forEach(function(element) {\n 4\n    element.addEventListener('change', function(event) {\n 5\n      const data = {\n 6\n        'line': event.target.dataset.line,\n 7\n        'quantity': event.target.dataset.quantity,\n 8\n        'id': event.target.value\n 9\n      }\n 10\n 11\n      fetch('/cart/change.js', {\n 12\n        method: 'POST',\n 13\n        headers: {\n 14\n          'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n 15\n        },\n 16\n        body: JSON.stringify(data)\n 17\n      })\n 18\n      .then(response => {\n 19\n        // Refresh page, or re-render cart\n 20\n        console.log(response);\n 21\n      })\n 22\n      .catch((error) => {\n 23\n        console.error('Error:', error);\n 24\n      });\n 25\n    });\n 26 });\n The checkout charge display in the cart\n Because pre-order and TBYB can change how much a customer has to pay up front, you should show them how much they'll be charged at checkout. You can calculate this amount using selling_plan.checkout_charge object.\n You can access a line item's checkout charge through its selling_plan_allocation.\n The following table outlines the types of checkout charges:\n Checkout charge type Description\n percentage A percent value representing the percentage amount of the full price that must be paid up front.\n price The price to be paid up front, in cents.\n Note\n You can't configure checkout charges for subscriptions. Because of this, subscriptions always have a value_type of percentage and value of 100.\n Example\n The following example outputs the appropriate line item price depending on whether the line item has a selling plan allocation, and what kind of selling plan it is.\n 1 {% if item.selling_plan_allocation %}\n 2\n    {%- assign checkout_charge = item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.checkout_charge -%}\n 3\n 4\n    {% if checkout_charge.value_type == 'percentage' %}\n 5\n      {{ item.original_price | times: checkout_charge.value | divided_by: 100 | money }}\n 6\n    {% else %}\n 7\n      {{ checkout_charge.value | money }}\n 8\n    {% endif %}\n 9 {% else %}\n 10\n    {{ item.original_price | money }}\n 11 {% endif %}\n Customer order selling plan display\n When a customer selects a selling plan, they should see the name of that selection on the customer order page.\n The selected selling plan, if there is one, is accessible through the selling_plan_allocation attribute of the line_item object. The following is an example:\n /customers/order.liquid\n 1 {% if line_item.selling_plan_allocation %}\n 2\n    <p class=\"selling-plan\">{{ line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name }}</p>\n 3 {% endif %}\n Was this section helpful?",

You can use the app and these tutorials as reference material to build a CLI 3-compatible app using the same patterns.\n Merchants can sell their products on your marketplace. Now you want to set up a billing model so that you can charge merchants a sales fee.\n In this tutorial, you'll take a fixed fee for each order made in the marketplace. You'll use a capped amount of $20 and charge a $0.5 fee for each order. This provides an approachable billing structure for merchants. It's similar to a monthly subscription of $20, but the merchant doesn\u2019t pay unless your marketplace has provided them with orders.\n What you'll learn\n After finishing this tutorial, you'll know how to do the following:\n Create a usage plan for billing merchants who make sales on your marketplace\n Add a monthly subscription plan for the marketplace\n Bill merchants a usage fee\n Requirements\n You've completed the tutorial for storing order data.\n Step 1: Set up subscription handlers\n To bill merchants for selling on your marketplace, you need to create the mutation that creates subscriptions and usage charges using the Admin API.\n In server/handlers/mutations create a file called create-app-subscription.js.\n In server/handlers/mutations/create-app-subscription.js, add a method that calls the appSubscriptionCreate mutation and creates a subscription with a usage pricing plan.\n The plan requires terms that tell merchants how you will be billing them, as well as a capped amount which is the maximum amount that you can charge the merchant per month. It also requires a return URL, which redirects the merchant back to your app after accepting the subscription in the Shopify admin. The method should return the subscription ID, confirmation URL, and line item ID.\n server/handlers/mutations/create-app-subscription.js\n 1 import {callShopifyGraphqlAPI} from '../client';\n 2 import dotenv from 'dotenv';\n 3 dotenv.config();\n 4\n 5 const APP_SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE = `\n 6\n    mutation AppSubscriptionCreate(\n 7\n      $name: String!\n 8\n      $returnUrl: URL!\n 9\n      $lineItems: [AppSubscriptionLineItemInput!]!\n 10\n    ) {\n 11\n      appSubscriptionCreate(\n 12\n        name: $name\n 13\n        test: true\n 14\n        returnUrl: $returnUrl\n 15\n        lineItems: $lineItems\n 16\n      ) {\n 17\n        userErrors {\n 18\n          message\n 19\n        }\n 20\n        confirmationUrl\n 21\n        appSubscription {\n 22\n          id\n 23\n          lineItems {\n 24\n            id\n 25\n          }\n 26\n        }\n 27\n      }\n 28\n    }\n 29 `;\n 30\n 31 export const createAppSubscription = async (shop, token, appHandle) => {\n 32\n    const variables = {\n 33\n      name: 'Mockingbird Marketplace Fee',\n 34\n      returnUrl: `https://${shop}/admin/apps/${appHandle}`,\n 35\n      lineItems: [\n 36\n        {\n 37\n          plan: {\n 38\n            appUsagePricingDetails: {\n 39\n              cappedAmount: {\n 40\n                amount: 20,\n 41\n                currencyCode: 'USD',\n 42\n              },\n 43\n              terms: '$0.5 per order',\n 44\n            },\n 45\n          },\n 46\n        },\n 47\n      ],\n 48\n    };\n 49\n 50\n    const resp = await callShopifyGraphqlAPI(shop, token, {\n 51\n      query: APP_SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE,\n 52\n      variables,\n 53\n    });\n 54\n    return {\n 55\n      subscriptionId: resp.body.data.appSubscriptionCreate.appSubscription.id,\n 56\n      subscriptionConfirmationUrl:\n 57\n        resp.body.data.appSubscriptionCreate.confirmationUrl,\n 58\n      subscriptionLineItemId:\n 59\n        resp.body.data.appSubscriptionCreate.appSubscription.lineItems[0].id,\n 60\n    };\n 61 };\n In server/handlers/rest create a file called get-app-subscription.js.\n In server/handlers/rest/get-app-subscription.js, export a method that gets the recurring application charge information given a subscription ID.\n You can use this to get the app subscription details after the subscription's created using the GraphQL Admin API mutation.\n server/handlers/rest/get-app-subscription.js\n 1 import {callShopifyRestAPI, HTTP_GET_METHOD} from '../client';\n 2\n 3 export const getAppSubscription = async (shop, token, id) => {\n 4\n    const resp = await callShopifyRestAPI(\n 5\n      shop,\n 6\n      token,\n 7\n      HTTP_GET_METHOD,\n 8\n      `recurring_application_charges/${id}`,\n 9\n    );\n 10\n 11\n    return resp.body.recurring_application_charge;\n 12 };\n In server/handlers/index.js, export the newly-created method from the handler module.\n server/handlers/index.js\n 1 // ...\n 2 import {createAppSubscription} from './mutations/create-app-subscription';\n 3 import {getAppSubscription} from './rest/get-app-subscription';\n 4\n 5 export {\n 6\n   // ...\n 7\n   createAppSubscription,\n 8\n   getAppSubscription,\n 9 };\n Step 2: Add a subscription confirmation URL to the internal API\n In the channel app, you need to redirect merchants to the subscription confirmation page so that they can accept the subscription.\n The confirmation URL is returned when you create the subscription, and expires after two days if the merchant has not approved the subscription. You can check the status of the confirmation URL by fetching the app subscription status. If it's stale, then you can create a new subscription.\n You'll need to update the Shop data model to store the subscription ID and line item ID, which you can subsequently use to bill merchants usage charges.\n Create a new sequelize migration that you'll use to add subscriptionId and subscriptionLineItemId columns to your Shop data model.\n Terminal\n $ npx sequelize migration:create --name add-shop-subscription-info\n The command creates a new file in your app's /migrations folder with following name: {TIMESTAMP}-add-shop-subscription-info.js\n Update the migration file to add the columns to your Shops data table.\n migrations/{TIMESTAMP}-add-shop-subscription-info.js\n 1 'use strict';\n 2 module.exports = {\n 3\n    up: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {\n 4\n      await queryInterface.addColumn('Shops', 'subscriptionId', {\n 5\n        type: Sequelize.STRING,\n 6\n      });\n 7\n      await queryInterface.addColumn('Shops', 'subscriptionLineItemId', {\n 8\n        type: Sequelize.STRING,\n 9\n      });\n 10\n    },\n 11\n 12\n    down: async (queryInterface) => {\n 13\n      await queryInterface.removeColumn('Shops', 'subscriptionId');\n 14\n      await queryInterface.removeColumn('Shops', 'subscriptionLineItemId');\n 15\n    },\n 16 };\n Add the new attributes to your Shop data model.\n models/shop.js\n 1 // ...\n 2 module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {\n 3\n    // ...\n 4\n    Shop.init(\n 5\n      {\n 6\n        // ...\n 7\n        subscriptionId: DataTypes.STRING,\n 8\n        subscriptionLineItemId: DataTypes.STRING,\n 9\n      },\n 10\n      // ...\n 11\n    );\n 12\n    return Shop;\n 13 };\n Run the migration to write the changes to your database.\n Terminal\n $ npx sequelize db:migrate\n In server/helpers.js, create a new method called getNewSubscriptionConfirmationUrl that creates a new app subscription, saves the details to the database, and returns a confirmation URL.\n server/helpers.js\n 1 // ...\n 2 import {createAppSubscription, getAppHandle} from './handlers';\n 3 import db from '../models';\n 4\n 5 // ...\n 6 export async function getNewSubscriptionConfirmationUrl(shop, accessToken) {\n 7\n    const appHandle = await getAppHandle(shop, accessToken);\n 8\n    const {subscriptionId, subscriptionConfirmationUrl, subscriptionLineItemId} =\n 9\n      await createAppSubscription(shop, accessToken, appHandle);\n 10\n 11\n    await db.Shop.update(\n 12\n      {subscriptionId, subscriptionLineItemId},\n 13\n      {where: {domain: shop}},\n 14\n    );\n 15\n 16\n    return subscriptionConfirmationUrl;\n 17 }\n In server/graphql/schema.js, create a new AdminShopSubscription type that contains fields for the confirmation URL and a Boolean to indicate whether the subscription is accepted.\n server/graphql/schema.js\n 1 export const schemaString = `\n 2 type AdminShopSubscription {\n 3\n   confirmationUrl: String\n 4\n   accepted: Boolean!\n 5 }\n 6 // ...\n 7 type AdminShop {\n 8\n   // ...\n 9\n   subscription: AdminShopSubscription!\n 10 }\n 11 // ...\n 12 `;\n In server/graphql/resolvers.js, add a subscription resolver to the AdminShop type.\n The resolver returns a confirmation URL for an app subscription, and whether the app subscription is accepted. Since the adminShop resolver on the Query type returns the shop details from the database, you can get the subscriptionId from the first parameter.\n server/graphql/resolvers.js\n 1 import {parseGid} from '@shopify/admin-graphql-api-utilities';\n 2 import {getAppSubscription} from '../handlers';\n 3 import {getNewSubscriptionConfirmationUrl} from '../helpers';\n 4\n 5 export const resolvers = {\n 6\n    // ...\n 7\n    AdminShop: {\n 8\n      // ...\n 9\n      subscription: async ({domain, accessToken, subscriptionId}) => {\n 10\n        if (!subscriptionId) {\n 11\n          const confirmationUrl = await getNewSubscriptionConfirmationUrl(\n 12\n            domain,\n 13\n            accessToken,\n 14\n          );\n 15\n          return {\n 16\n            confirmationUrl,\n 17\n            accepted: false,\n 18\n          };\n 19\n        }\n 20\n        const {status, confirmation_url} = await getAppSubscription(\n 21\n          domain,\n 22\n          accessToken,\n 23\n          parseGid(subscriptionId),\n 24\n        );\n 25\n        if (status === 'pending') {\n 26\n          return {\n 27\n            confirmationUrl: confirmation_url,\n 28\n            accepted: false,\n 29\n          };\n 30\n        }\n 31\n        if (status === 'active' || status === 'accepted') {\n 32\n          return {\n 33\n            accepted: true,\n 34\n          };\n 35\n        }\n 36\n 37\n        const confirmationUrl = await getNewSubscriptionConfirmationUrl(\n 38\n          domain,\n 39\n          accessToken,\n 40\n        );\n 41\n        return {\n 42\n          confirmationUrl,\n 43\n          accepted: false,\n 44\n        };\n 45\n      },\n 46\n    },\n 47\n    // ...\n 48 };\n Step 3: Add the subscription to the channel app\n You can update the merchant onboarding page to surface information about the billing agreement that you added to the internal GraphQL API.\n If the subscription is accepted, then mark the item in the onboarding checklist as completed. Otherwise, you'll redirect the merchant to the subscriptionConfirmationUrl so that they can accept the subscription.\n In app/src/sections/Onboarding/components/OnboardingInfoCard.jsx update the OnboardingInfoCard component to include information about the billing agreement.\n app/src/sections/Onboarding/components/OnboardingInfoCard.jsx\n 1 import {BillingStatementDollarMajor} from '@shopify/polaris-icons';\n 2\n 3 const OnboardingInfoCard = ({ onboardingInfoCompleted, state }) => {\n 4\n    // ...\n 5\n    return (\n 6\n      <OnboardingCard\n 7\n        title=\"What you need to know before you start\"\n 8\n        state={state}\n 9\n      >\n 10\n        <OnboardingInfo\n 11\n          completed={onboardingInfoCompleted}\n 12\n          items={[\n 13\n            // ...\n 14\n            {\n 15\n              icon: {\n 16\n                color: 'subdued',\n 17\n                source: BillingStatementDollarMajor,\n 18\n              },\n 19\n              title: 'Every order made through Mockingbird will have a $0.50 fee',\n 20\n              content: (\n 21\n                <p>\n 22\n                  The fee will be charged each time a buyer completes a checkout\n 23\n                  initiated in the marketplace, and will not be credited for\n 24\n                  refunded orders. You will be charged every month, up to a\n 25\n                  maximum of $20.00.\n 26\n                </p>\n 27\n              ),\n 28\n            },\n 29\n          ]}\n 30\n          // ...\n 31\n        />\n 32\n     </OnboardingCard>\n 33\n    );\n 34 };\n The onboarding information card should display information about the billing agreement. The following is an example:\n In app/src/sections/Onboarding/components/OnboardingChecklistCard.jsx, update the OnboardingChecklistCard component to accept props for the subscription confirmation URL and whether the subscription is accepted.\n The component should render an item for the subscription agreement, which redirects to the confirmation URL on action.",

This guide explains the key principles of subscription needs and component-level guidelines for implementing subscription user interfaces (UIs).\n User experience principles\n To provide a good experience when purchasing subscriptions and gain trust from customers, make sure to implement the following UX principles:\n Create a visible hierarchy: Customers should be able to clearly identify the savings of a subscription plan, the selling plan options, and the terms and conditions.\n Disclose information progressively and logically: Customers should have a sense of progression in subscription selection as their decisions clearly influence subsequent choices. Adapt the information shown in the customer flow to communicate subscriptions clearly and concisely.\n Provide a seamless integration: The subscriptions UI should be integrated into the theme\u2019s existing design system.\n Work with merchants' existing workflows: Shopify provides the tooling for apps to build subscription experiences. Subscription experiences can be accessed directly from the Shopify admin. This allows merchants to access your app from the surface areas they are familiar with.\n If a resource exists in Shopify, don't duplicate it in your app: Shopify-managed resources such as customers, discounts, and products should be managed in a single place to reduce complex workflows and duplication.\n User interface guidelines\n Before you integrate your subscription app into a theme, familiarize yourself with the UI guidelines and best practices that are associated with each component.\n Apps should consider how subscription products appear in multiple places on the online store, such as product pages, collection pages, search results, featured product sections on the home page, and quick view modals on product cards. Surfacing potential subscription savings and pricing in these areas can further encourage customers to subscribe.\n Subscription information is displayed in the following components of the online store:\n Product forms\n Cart items\n Order details\n The following sections include guidance for displaying prices, styling subscription UI components, and presenting multiple subscriptions. In each section, the relevant Liquid properties needed to create each component are also referenced.\n Product forms\n The product form allows a customer to select their subscription. This is where the merchant can provide clarity and more details for a product and its available variants. Product forms are used in product pages, featured product sections on home pages, and quick view modals on product cards.\n The subcomponents of a product form include the following:\n A. Price\n B. Selling plan selection\n C. Selling plan details\n D. Main call-to-action\n Price\n Customers should be able to clearly identify the price of a subscription.\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Price selling_plan_allocation.price Reflect the price details from the selected subscription.\n 2 Compare at price selling_plan_allocation.compare_at_price\n 3 Per delivery price selling_plan_allocation.per_delivery_price\n \n Displays only when the value is different from price. This occurs when the selling plan is a prepaid subscription.\n 4 Unit price selling_plan_allocation.unit_price\n \n Unit price values may differ between sellingPlanAllocations. Unit measurement information is on the variant object, as it does not change based on sellingPlan.\n 5 Subscription badge selling_plan.recurring_deliveries\n \n The badge shown when the selling plan involves recurring deliveries (subscription). Provide a contextual subscription badge or label to help differentiate against a one-time subscription.\n \n To reduce the clutter on a product page, don't display a badge when the item can only be purchased as a subscription. Rely on other ways to express this detail.\n 6 Price adjustment selling_plan.price_adjustment\n \n The object includes information on whether the adjustment is price or percentage based. This is used instead of sale price. Consider adding \"subscription savings\" details to highlight the subscription's value. For example, \"Subscription - Save $3.00\" or \"Subscription - Save 10%\".\n \n For subscriptions with a pricing policy that changes over time, express the largest savings. For example, \"Save up to 30%\". For more information, refer to Communicating changes in price over time.\n Pricing patterns\n A subscription usually comes with savings to encourage customers to purchase products. Two common patterns for displaying a subscription's pricing information are a main price component and inline pricing. These patterns can be implemented at the same time in a design, but this can be a challenge in situations where you don't have control over the codebase for both the app and the theme.\n Tip\n The inline pricing pattern is useful for subscription apps that integrate into a third-party theme codebase.\n Regardless of your approach to displaying prices to customers, the following points should guide your implementation:\n The price of a subscription is clearly visible when a customer has selected a selling plan from a product form.\n For products with unit pricing, ensure that any change to the unit price from a subscription is displayed.\n If an item is a prepaid item, then display the price per delivery. This enables customers to better compare the price difference between one-time purchases and prepaid items.\n MAIN PRICE COMPONENT\n In this approach, there is a main price component on the page that's updated when a customer interacts with a selling plan selector and product variant selection.\n To help customers understand the price of products that they purchase, do the following:\n Clearly display the subscription item's price and any applicable savings compared to the price of a one-time purchase.\n Add a subscription badge to the component to help clarify that the savings are conditional to the purchase of a subscription.\n INLINE PRICING\n In this approach, pricing information is displayed inline or close to the selling plan selection. The price updates in response to changes in selling plan and product variant selection.\n This approach makes a strong association between the effects of choosing a selling plan and the price. The positioning of the price is also preferable for mobile shopping, where smaller screen sizes mean that the main price component and price updates might not be in view.\n This approach is useful for subscription apps that integrate into the codebase of third-party themes. Because the pricing information is contained within a selling plan selector that the app controls and injects, this approach can help to avoid conflicts between the app's and the theme's respective scripts.\n Selling plan selection\n Customers should be able to clearly identify their subscription options:\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 subscriptions label product.requires_selling_plan\n \n product.selling_plan_groups One-time subscriptions and selling plan groups are considered different subscriptions. Use the term subscriptions in your own designs.\n 2 One-time subscription product.requires_selling_plan\n \n If the property is false, then at least 1 variant can be purchased as a one-time purchase and the one-time subscription should be presented in the UI. Group behavior\n \n On the first page load, select the one-time subscription by default. When the customer interacts with the UI, consider collapsing the unselected group to make good usage of space. Disable the selling plan group selection when it isn't available for a given variant.\n \n Group layout\n \n Prioritize displaying subscriptions in a vertically stacked list to make them readable on all devices. When displayed side-by-side, the information can be crowded on smaller screens.\n \n Group style\n \n Consider displaying subscriptions as radio inputs instead of buttons. Buttons can easily compete with the product form\u2019s call-to-action (submit button).\n 3 Selling plan group name selling_plan_group.name\n \n Always make this value visible. For more information, refer to Selling plan group name.\n 4 Inline price selling_plan_allocation.per_delivery_price\n \n Using the per_delivery_price is a more relevant comparison between prepaid subscriptions and one-time purchases. Showing the price of selling plans inline makes it easier for customers to compare subscriptions.\n \n Show \"each\" next to the price for both one-time subscriptions and selling plan groups to maintain consistency and clarity among similar text information.\n \n For subscriptions with a pricing policy that changes over time, add \"from\" before the inline pricing to clearly communicate the lowest price of the selling plan group. For example, \"from $7.00\". For more information, refer to Communicating changes in price over time.\n 5 Selling plan option name selling_plan_option.name Contextualize the type of selling plan option.\n \n Displaying selling plan options\n \n Selling plan option values are often written in a way that assumes that the option name is also visible to the customer. For example:\n \n Name: \"Delivery every\"\n Option: \"Month\"\n Option: \"Week\"\n Never hide the option names. Certain site designs will hide form labels to make a page look clean, but this can result in the values being presented with no context.\n 6 Selling plan option value selling_plan_option.value\n \n For more information, refer to Display selling plan option values. Don't express exact prices in option values, such as \"Save $5 a week\", because the values won't be accurate if the currency changes.\n \n Expressing percentages is possible because they stay consistent even if the currency changes. For more information, refer to Considerations for currency switching and price rounding.\n subscriptions label\n Show the subscriptions label when the following conditions apply:\n A one-time purchase exists and there's at least one sellingPlanGroups.\n A one-time purchase isn't an option, but there are multiple sellingPlanGroups.\n Shopify doesn't show the subscriptions label when the following conditions apply:\n There are no selling plan groups.\n The product is subscription-only and there's only 1 selling plan group. In this case, the sellingPlanGroup\u2019s name remains in its position, but without the radio input.\n Subscription-only use case\n Keep the selling group name and the inline price within the selector container. This sustains a stronger relationship between subscription selection and per_delivery_price, and maintains a consistent approach across different use cases:\n Selling plan group name\n Selling plan names should make clear the benefit of signing up for a subscription. For example, \"Subscribe and save 10%\". This incentivizes customers to make a bigger commitment in comparison to one-time subscriptions.\n Because the Selling plan API allows for multiple selling plan groups on a product, selling plan group names are used to differentiate subscriptions.\n Display selling plan option values\n It's required to display all of the option values at a glance from a group. Consider adapting the component layout to optimize readability.\n Components should adapt to the number of options being shown. When there are many options to choose from, an appropriate component should be selected to enable customers to view all options easily. Where there is a small number of options, a different component may be used. When possible, apply the appropriate layout to all values within a selling plan group for consistency:\n 4 options or less: Show each option as a radio button to allow customers to view what\u2019s available.\n More than 4 options: Use a select dropdown to emphasize the customer's selection and hide other options within the collapsed dropdown.\n UI UPDATE ON VARIANT CHANGE\n A product\u2019s variants might not all support the same subscription options. As a customer changes their variant selection, the components should update to make clear which subscription options are available and unavailable.\n When a selected option within a selling plan group is unavailable, three events should happen:\n The unavailable options become unselected and require the customer to make a new selection to successfully submit the form.\n The unavailable options for the selected variant are disabled.\n The form submission button is enabled. Disabling the button removes the ability to display an error message and instead displays the product as unavailable, which is false. Let the customer click the button but prevent them from adding the product to the cart. Then, anchor and scroll back to the faulty UI area and display a message that describes why the process can't complete and what the customer needs to do to proceed.\n Selling plan details\n Display important subscription terms and selections to customers. The subscription summary confirms a customer's selections, shows any conditions, and helps build trust in the brand.\n # UI element API properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Recurring price line selling_plan_allocation.price_adjustments\n \n selling_plan.price_adjustments \n \n The selling_plan contains information on how a plan affects product prices, while the selling_plan_allocation describes the price for the variant to which the selling plan is applied. Express the number of payment cycles at the current price, and communicate what the price will be in the future. For example, first payment $6.00, then $9.00.\n \n Include the word \"each\" to clarify when the number of independent recurring payment cycles is greater than 1. For example, first 3 payments $7.00 each, then $9.00.\n \n Use \"free\" when the value is $0.00. This mirrors natural speech and helps customers understand the element. For example, first payment free, then $9.00.\n 2 Selling plan description selling_plan.description\n \n Merchants might use this field for promotional text. For example, they might use it for marketing terms, a call-to-action, or preemptively answering questions about cancellation policies or refunds.\n \n For more information, refer to Subscription policy link. Don't express exact prices in option values, for example, \"Save $5 a week\". For more information, refer to Considerations for currency switching and price rounding.\n \n Consider including a link to the subscription policy in the description. Merchants might have a more detailed subscription policy that needs to be accessed by customers.\n \n For subscriptions with a pricing policy that changes over time, for example, \"First month free, then save 10% on renewals\", communicate any future price changes clearly on the product page. For more information, refer to Communicating changes in price over time.\n Communicating changes in price over time\n Selling plans can have multiple price policies, which allows for the price of a subscription item to change after a certain period. A common approach is to encourage purchases with a lower initial price, for example, \"Save $10 on the first 3 deliveries.\"\n If an initial price incentive is applied to a subscription, then explain the current payment and how payments will change in the future.\n It\u2019s important to be transparent. A lack of information can cause customer mistrust and might appear misleading.",

A product form can be added to any template that can access the product object.\n Resources\n To support pre-orders or TBYB in your theme, you'll use the following resources:\n The form object.\n Objects and object properties that represent selling plan information, including the following:\n selling_plan_group: A group of selling plans that are available for the product's variants.\n selling_plan: The details of the selling plan.\n selling_plan_allocation: Information about how a particular selling plan affects a line item.\n variant.requires_selling_plan.\n The /{locale}/cart/change.js endpoint of the Cart AJAX API.\n Depending on where you're implementing your selling plan functionality, you'll access selling plan information through the following parent objects:\n Context Example template types Parent object\n Product and variant listings product variant\n Variants that have been added to a cart or are part of an order\n cart\n customers/order\n line_item\n For more information about how to present each of these objects and their attributes, refer to Pre-orders and Try Before You Buy UX guidelines.\n Implementing pre-orders or TBYB displays\n To support pre-orders or TBYB in your theme, you need to implement the following components:\n A selling plan selector on the product page: This selector enables customers to select a selling plan.\n JavaScript to update the selling plan: Use JavaScript to update the available selling plans when variants are selected, and update the hidden selling plan input as selling plan options are selected.\n A selling plan display in the cart: Indicate to customers when a selling plan has been applied to a line item. You can also implement a selling plan selector to give the option to add a new selling plan, or to remove or edit the current selling plan.\n A checkout charge in the cart: Display a checkout charge that represents the amount that customers need to pay during checkout.\n A selling plan display on the customer order pages: Indicate to customers when a selling plan has been applied to a line item.\n The selling plan selector on the product page\n You can add a selling plan selector for products wherever you can access the product form. For example, you might add a selling plan selector to the product template or a section in the template.\n Selling plan groups and individual selling plans have a similar structure to products and variants. You can view selling plan groups like products, where there are multiple options that comprise an individual selling plan, similar to variant options that comprise an individual variant.\n You can access the available selling plan options through the selling_plan_groups attribute of the product.\n Add the following to your product form:\n For each selling_plan_group, output each of its options inside the product form.\n To track the ID of the selected selling plan, add an input with an attribute of name=\"selling_plan\". The value should be the ID of the selected selling plan. If there's no selected selling plan, then the value should be empty.\n Save the product object so that it can be accessed in JavaScript.\n Example\n The following is an example of how you can display the selling plan group in your product form. Make sure to add the code inside your product form. The example is referring to the file selling-plans-integration.js. This file is covered in the JavaScript section. The following code is doing the following:\n Assigning the product and the current variant to be used inside the integration\n Looping through every selling plan group, and displaying each associated selling plan\n Adding a pre-orders or TBYB badge to display next to the product price when a buyer is selecting either a pre-order or TBYB\n Note\n This example demonstrates how to integrate selling plans into your theme. We recommend customizing this integration to suit your specific needs.

You can update the handler to also run the requirements check and write resource feedback accordingly.\n In server/handlers/webhooks/shop-update.js update the handleShopUpdate function to fetch the relevant data using the handlers that you created and write resource feedback.\n The webhook body already contains some of the information you need, so you don\u2019t need to fetch the shop\u2019s configuration.\n You can also update whether the shop meets the requirements in your database by updating the meetsRequirements field.\n server/handlers/webhooks/shop-update.js\n 1 import Shopify from '@shopify/shopify-api';\n 2 import {getShopPolicyTypes, getShopShippingCountries} from '..';\n 3 import {handleResourceFeedback, isShopApproved} from '../../helpers';\n 4 import db from '../../../models';\n 5\n 6 export const handleShopUpdate = async (shop, body) => {\n 7\n    const {name, has_storefront, enabled_presentment_currencies} =\n 8\n      JSON.parse(body);\n 9\n    const {accessToken} = await Shopify.Utils.loadOfflineSession(shop);\n 10\n    const shipsToCountries = await getShopShippingCountries(shop, accessToken);\n 11\n    const policyTypes = await getShopPolicyTypes(shop, accessToken);\n 12\n 13\n    const meetsRequirements = isShopApproved(\n 14\n      has_storefront,\n 15\n      enabled_presentment_currencies,\n 16\n      shipsToCountries,\n 17\n      policyTypes,\n 18\n    );\n 19\n 20\n    await handleResourceFeedback(shop, accessToken, meetsRequirements);\n 21\n 22\n    const shopData = {\n 23\n      name,\n 24\n      meetsRequirements,\n 25\n    };\n 26\n 27\n    try {\n 28\n      await db.Shop.update(shopData, {where: {domain: shop}});\n 29\n    } catch (err) {\n 30\n      console.error('Failed to update shop in db', err);\n 31\n    }\n 32 };\n Step 4: Add shipping profile webhook handlers\n You also need to handle changes to the shop's shipping countries using webhooks, which will be triggered when a shop makes changes to their shipping profiles. Changes to shipping profiles can impact the shop's shipping countries.\n You'll subscribe to the following profile-related webhooks:\n PROFILES_CREATE\n PROFILES_UPDATE\n PROFILES_DELETE\n Since there are a few webhooks, you'll create a new handler for shipping profile updates.\n In the server/handlers/webhooks folder, create a shipping-profile.js file.\n In server/handlers/webhooks/shipping-profile.js, export a function that will fetch the requirement-related shop data, and write the appropriate resource feedback.\n You'll also update whether the shop meets the requirements in your database by updating the meetsRequirements field.\n server/handlers/webhooks/shipping-profile.js\n 1 import Shopify from '@shopify/shopify-api';\n 2 import {\n 3\n    getShopConfiguration,\n 4\n    getShopPolicyTypes,\n 5\n    getShopShippingCountries,\n 6 } from '..';\n 7 import db from '../../../models';\n 8 import {handleResourceFeedback, isShopApproved} from '../../helpers';\n 9\n 10 export const handleShippingProfileUpdate = async (shop) => {\n 11\n    const {accessToken} = await Shopify.Utils.loadOfflineSession(shop);\n 12\n 13\n    const {has_storefront, enabled_presentment_currencies} =\n 14\n      await getShopConfiguration(shop, accessToken);\n 15\n    const shipsToCountries = await getShopShippingCountries(shop, accessToken);\n 16\n    const policyTypes = await getShopPolicyTypes(shop, accessToken);\n 17\n 18\n    const meetsRequirements = isShopApproved(\n 19\n      has_storefront,\n 20\n      enabled_presentment_currencies,\n 21\n      shipsToCountries,\n 22\n      policyTypes,\n 23\n    );\n 24\n 25\n    await handleResourceFeedback(shop, accessToken, meetsRequirements);\n 26\n 27\n    try {\n 28\n      await db.Shop.update({meetsRequirements}, {where: {domain: shop}});\n 29\n    } catch (err) {\n 30\n      console.error('Failed to update shop in db', err);\n 31\n    }\n 32 };\n In server/handlers/webhooks/setup.js, register the profile webhooks and call the handler created above in the webhook\u2019s callback function.\n server/handlers/webhooks/setup.js\n 1 // ...\n 2 import {handleShippingProfileUpdate} from './shipping-profile';\n 3\n 4 // ...\n 5 const PROFILES_CREATE = 'PROFILES_CREATE';\n 6 const PROFILES_UPDATE = 'PROFILES_UPDATE';\n 7 const PROFILES_DELETE = 'PROFILES_DELETE';\n 8\n 9 export const addWebhookHandlers = () => {\n 10\n    // ...\n 11\n 12\n    Shopify.Webhooks.Registry.addHandler(PROFILES_CREATE, {\n 13\n      path: '/webhooks',\n 14\n      webhookHandler: async (_topic, shop) =>\n 15\n        await handleShippingProfileUpdate(shop),\n 16\n    });\n 17\n 18\n    Shopify.Webhooks.Registry.addHandler(PROFILES_UPDATE, {\n 19\n      path: '/webhooks',\n 20\n      webhookHandler: async (_topic, shop) =>\n 21\n        await handleShippingProfileUpdate(shop),\n 22\n    });\n 23\n 24\n    Shopify.Webhooks.Registry.addHandler(PROFILES_DELETE, {\n 25\n      path: '/webhooks',\n 26\n      webhookHandler: async (_topic, shop) =>\n 27\n        await handleShippingProfileUpdate(shop),\n 28\n    });\n 29 }\n The resource banner on the shop\u2019s homepage should now dynamically update based on changes made to the shop\u2019s payment, shipping, policy, and online store settings. The shop\u2019s database field should also be updated accordingly.\n Step 5: Add requirements to the channel app\n Now that you have the handlers and helpers required to check each requirement, you can expose whether the requirements are met using your internal GraphQL API. This is necessary to build the requirements checklist.\n In server/graphql/schema.js add a new type that returns Boolean fields for each of the marketplace requirements.\n You'll also add a new field to the Shop type that returns the new type and a Boolean to indicate whether the shop meets requirements.\n server/graphql/schema.js\n 1 export const schemaString = `\n 2 type AdminShopConfig {\n 3\n    hasStorefront: Boolean!\n 4\n    shipsToCanada: Boolean!\n 5\n    cadEnabled: Boolean!\n 6\n    hasPolicies: Boolean!\n 7 }\n 8 type AdminShop {\n 9\n    // ...\n 10\n    meetsRequirements: Boolean!\n 11\n    config: AdminShopConfig!\n 12 }\n 13 // ...\n 14 `;\n Update server/graphql/resolvers.js with a set of resolvers for the Shop configuration fields.\n You don't need to define an explicit resolver for the meetsRequirements field, since it can be automatically resolved from the field of that name in the database's Shop data model.\n You can use the helpers and handlers that you created to fetch the relevant data and run the requirements checks.\n server/graphql/resolvers.js\n 1 // ...\n 2 import {\n 3\n    getShopConfiguration,\n 4\n    getShopShippingCountries,\n 5\n    getShopPolicyTypes,\n 6 } from '../handlers';\n 7 import {\n 8\n    isShopCurrencyApproved,\n 9\n    isShopPolicyApproved,\n 10\n    isShopShippingApproved,\n 11 } from '../helpers';\n 12\n 13 export const resolvers = {\n 14\n    // ...\n 15\n    AdminShop: {\n 16\n      // ...\n 17\n      config: async ({domain, accessToken}) => {\n 18\n        const {has_storefront, enabled_presentment_currencies} =\n 19\n          await getShopConfiguration(domain, accessToken);\n 20\n        const shipsToCountries = await getShopShippingCountries(\n 21\n          domain,\n 22\n          accessToken,\n 23\n        );\n 24\n        const shopPolicies = await getShopPolicyTypes(domain, accessToken);\n 25\n        return {\n 26\n          hasStorefront: has_storefront,\n 27\n          cadEnabled: isShopCurrencyApproved(enabled_presentment_currencies),\n 28\n          shipsToCanada: isShopShippingApproved(shipsToCountries),\n 29\n          hasPolicies: isShopPolicyApproved(shopPolicies),\n 30\n        };\n 31\n      },\n 32\n    },\n 33\n    // ...\n 34 };\n You can use the new fields from your internal GraphQL API to surface the requirements checklist in your channel app.\n In app/src/sections/Onboarding/components create an OnboardingChecklistCard.jsx file.\n In app/src/sections/Onboarding/components/OnboardingChecklistCard.jsx create a component that will render an OnboardingCard component that contains an OnboardingChecklist component.\n The component should accept props to indicate whether each requirement is met and ensure each requirement redirects to the relevant section in the Shopify admin.\n app/src/Sections/components/OnboardingChecklistCard.jsx\n 1 import React from 'react';\n 2 import {OnboardingCard,

extension code in Step 2 works.\n Showing the selling plan options\n To show the selling plan options to buyers, you need to use the Select component. When a buyer selects a new selling plan, we update the value of the selected purchase option.\n src/index\n React\n Vanilla\n src/index.jsx\n 1 <Select\n 2\n    label=\"Purchase options\"\n 3\n    onChange={(value) =>\n 4\n      setSelectedPurchaseOption(parseInt(value, 10))\n 5\n    }\n 6\n    value={selectedPurchaseOption.toString()}\n 7\n    options={purchaseOptions.map((option, index) => ({\n 8\n      label: option.title,\n 9\n      value: index.toString(),\n 10\n    }))}\n 11 />\n After you've updated the code, the selling plan option renders as follows:\n Updating the price breakdown\n To show the price breakdown matching the currently selected offer, you need to call calculateChangeset when the buyer selects a selling plan:\n src/index\n React\n Vanilla\n src/index.jsx\n 1 // Define the changes that you want to make to the purchase, including the discount to the product.\n 2 useEffect(() => {\n 3\n    async function calculatePurchase() {\n 4\n      // Call Shopify to calculate the new price of the purchase, if the above changes are applied.",

A lack of information can cause customer mistrust and might appear misleading. Certain states and countries have laws around price clarity, which means that merchants might be subject to lawsuits.\n Subscription policy link\n In the mockup, the link to View subscription policy is part of the selling plan description and therefore in the merchant\u2019s or app\u2019s control to provide. The intention is to allow individual selling plans to provide a link out to a dedicated URL, if available.\n Theshop.subscription_policy object available in Liquid makes it possible to link to a dedicated /policies/subscription-policy page. The content of the page is editable by the merchant in the Shopify admin under Legal settings (/admin/settings/legal). The content of the subscription policy is also available at checkout.\n Main call-to-action\n Having a call-to-action that reflects the subscription type helps customers differentiate between subscription options and the one-time subscription.\n # UI element API properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Call-to-action On first page load, if the product requires a selling plan or one is selected, then switch the call-to-action string to something subscription-specific that merchants can customize.\n \n Shopify doesn't display the dynamic checkout button on products that include selling plans. Ensure that the theme accounts for this, and that the primary call-to-action style is used for the form submission. Update the call-to-action label to Add subscription to cart for a subscription subscription.\n Cart items\n Each subscription item displays the most important subscription details to help customers understand their purchase. Customers should be able to understand a subscription\u2019s delivery frequency and, if applicable, the commitment period. The price should also match what is represented on the product page.\n The subcomponents of a cart item include the following:\n Cart page\n Cart notification\n Cart page\n Customers tend to scan the cart page and review the information before proceeding to checkout:\n # UI element API properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Selling plan information line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name\n \n Use selling_plan.name in the cart line item. This same text is used at checkout. For more information, refer to Using the selling plan name. Because the selling plan name is meant to accurately summarize the subscription, don't list the individual selling plan option values alongside the selling plan name.\n Cart notification\n The cart notification returns information about the item that was just added to the cart:\n # UI element API properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Selling plan information line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name\n \n This information comes from a Cart API JSON response.\n \n Use selling_plan.name in the order line item. The same text is used at checkout. For more information, refer to Using the selling plan name. Because the selling plan name is meant to accurately summarize the subscription, don't list the individual selling plan option values alongside the selling plan name.\n Using the selling plan name\n The selling_plan.name should be a succinct description of the selling plan that can be easily understood by customers. The text is displayed in multiple areas of the online store, such as cart line items, checkout, and past order details. The value is also displayed in the merchant\u2019s internal admin on order pages.\n Note\n The selling plan name shouldn't be an additional opportunity to write marketing text.\n Shopify doesn't control the value of the name, which means that merchants can enter any text value they want using an app.\n When creating selling plan names, implement the following recommended guidelines:\n State the delivery frequency and a prepaid period, if applicable.\n Don't state exact dollars amounts, for example, \"$9 a month\". Use percentages when applicable.\n Considerations for currency switching and price rounding\n Merchants can sell in multiple currencies on their online store.\n When a customer visits the online store, Shopify presents the currency that's determined appropriate for the customer. Online stores can offer a currency selector to customers to enable them to manually switch the currency. Shopify also offers a price rounding feature to merchants, which allows merchants to set custom rounding rules for converted prices.\n Apps and merchants shouldn't write any prices in the various strings that are shown to customers, for example, selling plan names that say \"$9.99 a month\" or \"Save $5\". Any prices that are written in these strings won't reflect currency switching or price rounding, and might be incorrect or misleading to customers.\n When an app or merchant wants to express savings in a text field, use percentages whenever possible. For example, \"Deliver every week (Save 20%)\".\n Note\n Price properties returned from APIs of the Online Store (Liquid or JSON) reflect the currency of the customer's session and any price rounding rules.\n Order details\n Customers logged in to the store can view the details of each past order. It's important to let the customer easily identify the subscription product.\n # UI element API properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Selling plan information line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name\n \n Use selling_plan.name in the cart notification line item. The same text is used at checkout. For more information, refer to Using the selling plan name. Because the selling plan name is meant to accurately summarize the subscription, don't list the individual selling plan option values alongside the selling plan name.\n Next steps\n Create and manage selling plans: Follow a step-by-step workflow to create and manage selling plans in your subscription app.\n Getting started building a product subscription app extension: Learn how to create a new product subscription app extension with App Bridge Admin, connect the extension to Shopify, and render your working code inside Shopify's UI.\n Was this section helpful?\n YesNo\n ON THIS PAGE\n User experience principles\n User interface guidelines\n Product forms\n Cart items\n Order details\n Next steps",

For example, use \"pre-order\", \"back-order\", and \"TBYB\".\n User interface guidelines\n Before you integrate your pre-order and TBYB options app into a theme, familiarize yourself with the UX guidelines and best practices that are associated with each component.\n Apps should consider that products with different ways of purchasing are displayed in the following places on the online store:\n Product pages\n Collection pages\n Search results\n Featured product sections on the home page\n Quick view modals on product cards\n When customers can see available ways of purchasing at relevant points in the shopping process, they're more likely to utilize them. Ensure that all relevant information is always included, such as the deposit amount and fulfillment date, estimate for pre-orders, or the trial period length for TBYB.\n Pre-order and TBYB information is displayed in the following components of the online store:\n Product forms\n Cart items\n Order details\n The following sections include guidance for displaying prices, styling UI components for pre-orders and TBYB, and presenting multiple purchasing options. In each section, the relevant Liquid properties that are required to create each component are also referenced.\n Product forms\n The product form enables a customer to select their pre-order or TBYB option. This form is where the merchant can provide clarity and more details for a product and its available variants. Product forms are used in product pages, featured product sections on home pages, and quick view modals on product cards.\n The subcomponents of a product form include the following:\n A. Price\n B. Selling plan selection\n C. Selling plan details\n D. Main call-to-action\n Example: Product form (pre-order)\n Example: Product form (TBYB)\n A. Price\n Customers should be able to clearly identify the full price of the product, and the type of purchasing option that the product is.\n Example: Price (pre-order)\n Product form: Price\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Price price Reflect the price details from the selected pre-order.\n 2 Pre-order badge selling_plan_group.name\n \n Reflect the price details from the selected pre-order. Provide a contextual pre-order badge or label to help differentiate against a one-time pre-order. The badge or label will help customers quickly understand that this product can be bought as a pre-order.\n Pricing patterns\n Pre-orders and TBYB options don\u2019t usually come with savings to encourage customers to purchase products.\n Tip\n Pricing for pre-orders often requires a deposit. Don't use visual styling that suggests money saving pricing tactics, such as price strikethroughs, to represent the full price of a product in relation to the initial deposit. Instead, simply display the full price, and if the pre-order product requires a deposit, display the deposit price elsewhere on the page.\n Main price component\n The main price component should always display the total cost of an item. When a customer selects a selling plan or a product variant, the main price component should reflect their changes.\n To help customers understand what purchasing option they have selected, do the following:\n Clearly display the product's full price.\n Add the appropriate pre-order or TBYB badge to the component to help clarify to customers that they aren't buying a regular one-time product.\n Example: Main price component (pre-order)\n Example: Main price component (TBYB)\n B. Selling plan selection\n Customers should be able to clearly identify their pre-order or TBYB options.\n Example: Selling plan selection (pre-order)\n Example: Selling plan selection (TBYB)\n Selling plan selection\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Purchase options product.selling_plan_groups One-time purchases and selling plan groups are considered different types of purchasing options. Use the term **Purchase options** in your own designs.\n 2 One-time purchase product.requires_selling_plan\n \n If the property is false, then at least one variant can be purchased as a one-time purchase, and the one-time purchase option should be presented in the UI. Group behavior\n \n On the first page load, select the one-time option by default. When the customer interacts with the UI, consider collapsing the unselected group to make good use of the space. Disable the selling plan group selection when it isn\u2019t available for a given variant.\n \n Group layout\n \n Prioritize displaying purchasing options in a vertically stacked list to make them readable on all devices. When displayed side-by-side, the information can be crowded on smaller screens.\n \n Group style\n \n Consider displaying purchasing options as radio inputs instead of buttons. Buttons can easily compete with the product form\u2019s call-to-action. For example, a submit button.\n 3 Selling plan group name selling_plan_group.name\n \n Always make this value visible. For more information, refer to selling_plan_group.name.\n 4 Selling plan option value selling_plan_option.value Don\u2019t express exact prices in option values, such as \u201c$50 deposit\u201d, because the values won\u2019t be accurate if the currency changes.\n \n Expressing percentages is possible because they stay consistent even if the currency changes. For more information refer to Considerations for currency switching and price rounding.\n Purchase option label\n Show the Purchase options label when the following conditions apply:\n A one-time purchase exists and there's at least one sellingPlanGroup object.\n A one-time purchase isn't available, but there are multiple sellingPlanGroup objects of different types.\n Shopify doesn't show the Purchase options label when the following conditions apply:\n There are no selling plan groups.\n The product can only be purchased with a selling plan and there's only one selling plan group. In this case, the sellingPlanGroup name remains in its position, but without the radio input.\n Selling plan group name\n Selling plan names should make clear the benefit of choosing that option. For example, \"Pre-order\".\n Because the SellingPlan object can be associated with multiple selling plan groups on a product, selling plan group names are used to differentiate purchase options.\n Display selling plan option values\n All the option values must be displayed at a glance from a group. Consider adapting the component layout to optimize readability.\n Components should adapt to the number of options being shown. When there are many options to choose from, an appropriate component should be selected to enable customers to view all options easily. When there are fewer options, a different component may be used. When possible, apply the appropriate layout to all values within a selling plan group for consistency:\n Four options or less: Show each option as a radio button to allow customers to view what\u2019s available.\n More than four options: Use a select dropdown to emphasize the customer's selection and hide other options within the collapsed dropdown.\n UI UPDATE ON VARIANT CHANGE\n A product\u2019s variants might not all support the same purchasing options. As a customer changes their variant selection, the components should update to make clear which options are available and unavailable.\n When a selected option within a selling plan group is unavailable, the following events should happen:\n The unavailable options are unselected, and the customer must make a new selection to successfully submit the form.\n The unavailable options for the selected variant are disabled.\n The form submission button is enabled. Disabling the button removes the ability to display an error message and instead displays the product as unavailable, which is false. Let the customer click the button but prevent them from adding the product to the cart. Then, anchor and scroll back to the faulty UI area and display a message that describes why the process can't complete and what the customer needs to do to proceed.\n C. Selling plan details\n Display important deferred pre-order and TBYB terms and selections to customers. The summary confirms a customer's selections, shows any conditions, and helps build trust in the brand.\n Example: Selling plan details (pre-order)\n Selling plan details\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Selling plan description selling_plan.description Don't express exact prices in option values, for example, \"$100 deposit\". For more information, refer to Considerations for currency switching and price rounding.\n \n Consider including a link to the returns or billing policies in the description. Merchants might have more detailed policies that need to be accessed by customers.\n D. Main call-to-action\n Having a call-to-action (main button text) that reflects the purchasing option type helps customers differentiate between a pre-order or a TBYB and a one-time purchase, even if there's only one option available.\n Example: Shop has accelerated checkout (pre-order and TBYB)\n Example: Shop doesn\u2019t have accelerated checkout (pre-order and TBYB)\n Main call-to-action\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Call-to-action On first page load, if the product requires a selling plan or one is selected, then switch the call-to-action string to something purchase option-specific that merchants can customize. Update the call-to-action label to the dynamic checkout button for a deferred purchase option, and keep the add to cart button as is.\n Cart items\n Each pre-order or TBYB option item displays the most important details to help customers understand their purchase.\n For pre-order items, make sure that the customer understands the fulfillment date and relevant payment information, such as a deposit amount and future payments.\n For TBYB items, customers should see the trial period length. The price should also match what's represented on the product page.\n A cart item includes the following subcomponents:\n Cart page\n Cart notification\n Cart page\n Customers tend to scan the cart page and review the information before proceeding to checkout, so it\u2019s important that the following elements are clearly represented.\n Example: Cart page (pre-order)\n Example: Cart page (TBYB)\n Cart page\n # UI element Liquid properties and information UI guidelines\n 1 Selling plan information line_item.selling_plan_allocation.selling_plan.name\n \n Use selling_plan.name in the cart line item. This same text is used at checkout. For more information, refer to Using the selling plan name.

This same text is used at checkout. For more information, refer to Using the selling plan name. Because the selling plan name is meant to accurately summarize the deferred purchase option, don't list the individual selling plan option values alongside the selling plan name.\n 2 Price price Display the full price of the product so that the customer is reminded of the total cost of the item that they\u2019re buying.\n Using the selling plan name\n The selling_plan.name should be a succinct description of the selling plan that can be easily understood by customers. The text is displayed in multiple areas of the online store, such as cart line items, checkout, and past order details. The value is also displayed in the merchant\u2019s internal admin on order pages.\n Note\n The selling plan name shouldn't include any marketing text.\n Shopify doesn't control the value of the name, which means that merchants can enter any text value they want using an app.\n When creating selling plan names, implement the following recommended guidelines:\n State the type of deferred purchase option.\n Write the deposit amount and payment due date of the product in order for the customer to keep a reference of it throughout the purchase journey.\n Considerations for currency switching and price rounding\n Merchants can sell in multiple currencies on their online store.\n When a customer visits the online store, Shopify presents the currency that's determined appropriate for the customer. Online stores can offer a currency selector to customers to enable them to manually switch the currency. Shopify also offers a price rounding feature to merchants, which enables merchants to set custom rounding rules for converted prices.\n Note\n Any prices that are written in strings won't reflect currency switching or price rounding, and might be incorrect or misleading to customers.",

This is because the code is fragmented across different areas and data is indirectly passed across some boundaries. This convoluted system is necessary for security reasons described below, but it makes the code harder to trace.\n\nThis document can hopefully be used to better understand the checkout upsell discount system as a whole, to allow us to debug or make changes in the future.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Checkout\n\n> Part 1. Generate a `TamperProofCartAttribute` (Checkout Extension and Server)\n\n1. **Checkout Extension:** Request a `TamperProofCartAttribute` from the server for the offer being added.\n    - **Action:** The checkout extension sends a request to the server with the current `CheckoutData` and the ID of the offer.\n2. **Server:** Decide if a discount should be applied.\n    - **Action:** The server decides if a discount should be applied based on the provided `CheckoutData`. The server must **ONLY** use the provided `CheckoutData`, along with active offers from the database, when determining whether or not to apply a discount. The server must **NOT** use any other information regarding the current checkout.\n    - **Security:**\n        - The `CheckoutData` from the checkout extension is **NOT** secure since it is being sent to an insecure endpoint. Note that even with checkout session tokens, the `CheckoutData` is not secure because a customer could inspect the network requests to find the session token and then make arbitrary requests.\n        - The server does not need to verify the `CheckoutData`. It only needs to decide whether or not a discount should be applied _if the provided `CheckoutData` turns out to be verified_. The server can assume that the discount will only be applied for the given `CheckoutData`. If the checkout data is not actually what was provided, the discount will not be applied. Verification of the `CheckoutData` occurs in the Function.\n        - The server must not use any data other than the provided `CheckoutData` when determining whether or not a discount should be applied. This is because the Function is only provided the trusted `CheckoutData` by Shopify. The Function would not be able to invalidate a discount when a necessary factor changed, if that factor was not part of the `CheckoutData`.\n3. **Server:** Create a `TamperProofCartAttribute` using an HMAC signature of the `UnverifiedState` and `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`.\n    - **Action:** The server creates an HMAC signature from the combination of the `UnverifiedState` and the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`. The `UnverifiedState` is composed of the `CheckoutData` and the `ActiveOfferVersion`.\n        - Creating an HMAC signature involves first stringifying the relevant data and then signing the string with the shared secret between the Function and the server.\n    - **Security:**\n        - This HMAC signature will be used by the Function to verify that the `TamperProofCartAttribute` has not been tampered with. If the HMAC signature matches in the Function, this means that _if the `State` is X_, then the discount should be applied. The HMAC does not provide any indication of whether or not the `State` is verified.\n        - The `ActiveOfferVersion` is included in the `State` to ensure that the discount can be invalidated in the future. For example, the merchant might offer a lower discount amount after BFCM is finished, in which case the old discounts should no longer be valid. The merchant may also change the triggers for an offer such that the offer is only valid over $100, in which case any old discounts should no longer be valid.\n4. **Server:** Respond to the Checkout Extension with a `TamperProofCartAttribute`.\n    - **Action:** The server responds to the checkout extension's request with the newly generated `TamperProofCartAttribute`.\n5. **Checkout Extension:** Add the `TamperProofCartAttribute` to the cart.\n\n> Part 2. Apply a Discount from a `TamperProofCartAttribute` (Function)\n\n6. **Function:** Read the `TamperProofCartAttribute` and `TrustedState` from GraphQL input.\n    - **Security:**\n        - The `TrustedState` is composed of:\n            - `CheckoutData` from the GraphQL input. This is trusted because it is provided directly to the Function by Shopify's servers.\n            - A map of `ActiveOfferVersion`s from a discount private metafield. This is trusted because it can only be set from our server using the Admin API.\n7. **Function:** Verify that the `TamperProofCartAttribute` has not been tampered with.\n    - **Action:** The Function creates an HMAC signature from the data string of the `TamperProofCartAttribute` and the shared secret. The Function compares the HMAC that it generated against the HMAC from the `TamperProofCartAttribute`. If these are not equal, then the discount should **NOT** be applied.\n    - **Security:**\n        - This ensures that the attribute was generated by our server, and has not been modified (e.g., by the customer).\n        - This does **NOT** provide any indication of whether or not the state contained in the data of the `TamperProofCartAttribute` matches reality. The state must still be verified against the trusted state.\n        - This tells us that the _relationship_ between the `UnverifiedState` and the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified` is true. That is, if the `UnverifiedState` is true then our server says that the discount should be applied.\n8. **Function:** Verify the `UnverifiedState` using the `TrustedState`.\n    - **Action:** The Function compares the `UnverifiedState` from the `TamperProofCartAttribute` to the `TrustedState` from its GraphQL input. If these are not equal, then the discount should **NOT** be applied.\n    - **Security:**\n        - If the `TrustedState` matches the `UnverifiedState`, then it is safe to apply the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`.\n        - If the states are not equal, then one of the following may have happened:\n            1. The request to the server was forged and sent with a `CheckoutData` that did not match reality, or\n            2. The `CheckoutData` has changed since the `TamperProofCartAttribute` was created, or\n            3. The `ActiveOfferVersion` has changed since the `TamperProofCartAttribute` (e.g., due to the merchant editing the offer)\n9. **Function:** Apply the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified` from the `TamperProofCartAttribute`, if all previous checks pass.\n\n### Editor\n\n**Discount Metafields**\n\n-   `$app:upsell-offer-discount-function.private-state`:\n    -   `activeOfferVersions`: A key-value map of offer ID to active version number. This is used by the Function as part of the `TrustedState`.\n-   `$app:upsell-offer-discount-function.private-shared-secret-key`: This is the shared secret between the server and the Function used to generate HMAC signatures. This value should be _unique_ for each discount code to limit the damage if a key is compromised.\n\n**Updating Offers**\n\nWhen a discounted offer is changed, the active version number must be incremented. The combination of the offer ID and the active version number are used to create a `ActiveOfferVersion`. When the version number is incremented, then any `ActiveOfferVersion` that uses the old version number becomes invalid. This ensures that discounts from previous offer versions cannot be applied.\n\n## Type Definitions\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * A cart attribute that is used to transfer non-secret trusted data from our Server to the Function.\n * This is created on our server and verified in the Function.\n */\ninterface TamperProofCartAttribute {\n    /**\n     * A string containing the non-secret trusted data to be transfered.

Be sure to select the _Desktop development with C++_ workload when installing them.\n-   Install [`cargo-wasi`](https://bytecodealliance.github.io/cargo-wasi/)\n    -   `cargo install cargo-wasi`\n-   On Macs with Apple Silicon, you'll also need to install the Binaryen toolchain and set the `WASM_OPT` environment variable. ([related issue](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-wasi/issues/112))\n    -   `brew install binaryen`\n    -   Add `export WASM_OPT=/opt/homebrew/bin/wasm-opt` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`\n\n## Building the function\n\nYou can build this individual function using `cargo wasi`.\n\n```shell\ncargo wasi build --release\n```\n\nThe Shopify CLI `build` command will also execute this, based on the configuration in `shopify.function.extension.toml`.\n\n## Testing\n\n> Requires Node v16+\n\n1. Create a temporary JSON file (e.g., `a.json`) in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n    },\n    \"secretKey\": \"abc123\"\n}\n```\n\n2. Run the following command\n\n```\nyarn test:new-hmac < a.json\n```\n\n3. Copy the generated HMAC into the test file",

The issue was observed after a regression from Polaris 12.\n\nHypothesize:\nThe regression may be due to changes in the `OnboardingAcceptPricing` component or related hooks that manage the display and acceptance of pricing plans. The conditional logic that restricts non-checkout stores to the Basic plan might be missing or not functioning correctly.\n\nExperiment:\n- Review the `OnboardingAcceptPricing` component and related hooks to check if the conditional logic for restricting plan selection is present and correct.\n- Check if the `useAvailablePlanIds` hook correctly filters out non-Basic plans for non-checkout stores.\n- Verify that the `AcceptNoCheckout` component (which is likely responsible for rendering the plan options for non-checkout stores) correctly implements the restriction.\n\nAnalyze:\nBased on the provided code snippets, the `OnboardingAcceptPricing` component does not include any logic that differentiates between checkout and non-checkout stores when rendering pricing plans. The `AcceptNoCheckout` component is not provided, but it is likely where the issue lies since it is rendered when `hasCheckout` is false.\n\nResolve:\n- Ensure that the `AcceptNoCheckout` component (or wherever the plan selection UI is rendered for non-checkout stores) includes logic to only display the Basic plan as selectable and grays out other plans.\n- If the `AcceptNoCheckout` component is not responsible for this logic, identify the correct component or hook and implement the necessary restrictions there.\n- Add unit tests to cover the scenario where a non-checkout store attempts to select a non-Basic plan to ensure the expected behavior is maintained in the future.\n\nHere is a hypothetical example of how the `AcceptNoCheckout` component might be modified to resolve the issue:\n\n```tsx\nconst AcceptNoCheckout = () => {\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n  // Hypothetical logic to only allow the Basic plan for non-checkout stores\n  const plans = availablePlanIds.filter(planId => planId === BASIC_PLAN_ID);\n\n  return (\n    // ... render logic for plans, ensuring only the Basic plan is selectable ...\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAnd an example unit test to verify the behavior:\n\n```tsx\ndescribe('AcceptNoCheckout', () => {\n  it('should only allow non-checkout stores to select the Basic plan', () => {\n    // Setup for a non-checkout store context\n    // Render the AcceptNoCheckout component\n    // Assert that only the Basic plan is selectable and others are not\n  });\n});\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual implementation will depend on the existing codebase and the specifics of how the `AcceptNoCheckout` component or related logic is structured. The above examples are provided as a general guide.",
            "response": "To ensure a seamless onboarding experience for non-checkout stores, it's crucial to address the issue where these stores are currently able to select any pricing plan, contrary to the intended functionality that limits them to the Basic plan. This misalignment was identified following a recent update and needs to be corrected to maintain the integrity of the onboarding process.\n\n- Review the component responsible for plan selection during onboarding, specifically targeting the logic that should restrict non-checkout stores to the Basic plan.\n- If the `AcceptNoCheckout` component handles the plan options, update it to display only the Basic plan as selectable for non-checkout stores, while other plans should be grayed out and unselectable.\n- In the case that another component or hook, such as `useAvailablePlanIds`, is responsible for filtering available plans, ensure it is correctly identifying and restricting non-checkout stores to the Basic plan.\n- Implement unit tests to validate that non-checkout stores are only able to select the Basic plan, preventing any future regressions in this behavior.\n\nExample code modification for the component:\n\n```tsx\nconst AcceptNoCheckout = () => {\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n  // Logic to restrict non-checkout stores to the Basic plan\n  const plans = availablePlanIds.filter(planId => planId === BASIC_PLAN_ID);\n\n  return (\n    // ... render logic for plans, with only the Basic plan being selectable ...\n  );\n};\n```\n\nExample unit test to ensure correct behavior:\n\n```tsx\ndescribe('AcceptNoCheckout', () => {\n  it('should only allow non-checkout stores to select the Basic plan', () => {\n    // Setup for a non-checkout store context\n    // Render the AcceptNoCheckout component\n    // Assert that only the Basic plan is selectable and others are not\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThese steps and code snippets are provided as a guide, and the actual implementation should align with the existing codebase and component structure."

This is because the code is fragmented across different areas and data is indirectly passed across some boundaries. This convoluted system is necessary for security reasons described below, but it makes the code harder to trace.\n\nThis document can hopefully be used to better understand the checkout upsell discount system as a whole, to allow us to debug or make changes in the future.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Checkout\n\n> Part 1. Generate a `TamperProofCartAttribute` (Checkout Extension and Server)\n\n1. **Checkout Extension:** Request a `TamperProofCartAttribute` from the server for the offer being added.\n    - **Action:** The checkout extension sends a request to the server with the current `CheckoutData` and the ID of the offer.\n2. **Server:** Decide if a discount should be applied.\n    - **Action:** The server decides if a discount should be applied based on the provided `CheckoutData`. The server must **ONLY** use the provided `CheckoutData`, along with active offers from the database, when determining whether or not to apply a discount. The server must **NOT** use any other information regarding the current checkout.\n    - **Security:**\n        - The `CheckoutData` from the checkout extension is **NOT** secure since it is being sent to an insecure endpoint. Note that even with checkout session tokens, the `CheckoutData` is not secure because a customer could inspect the network requests to find the session token and then make arbitrary requests.\n        - The server does not need to verify the `CheckoutData`. It only needs to decide whether or not a discount should be applied _if the provided `CheckoutData` turns out to be verified_. The server can assume that the discount will only be applied for the given `CheckoutData`. If the checkout data is not actually what was provided, the discount will not be applied. Verification of the `CheckoutData` occurs in the Function.\n        - The server must not use any data other than the provided `CheckoutData` when determining whether or not a discount should be applied. This is because the Function is only provided the trusted `CheckoutData` by Shopify. The Function would not be able to invalidate a discount when a necessary factor changed, if that factor was not part of the `CheckoutData`.\n3. **Server:** Create a `TamperProofCartAttribute` using an HMAC signature of the `UnverifiedState` and `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`.\n    - **Action:** The server creates an HMAC signature from the combination of the `UnverifiedState` and the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`. The `UnverifiedState` is composed of the `CheckoutData` and the `ActiveOfferVersion`.\n        - Creating an HMAC signature involves first stringifying the relevant data and then signing the string with the shared secret between the Function and the server.\n    - **Security:**\n        - This HMAC signature will be used by the Function to verify that the `TamperProofCartAttribute` has not been tampered with. If the HMAC signature matches in the Function, this means that _if the `State` is X_, then the discount should be applied. The HMAC does not provide any indication of whether or not the `State` is verified.\n        - The `ActiveOfferVersion` is included in the `State` to ensure that the discount can be invalidated in the future. For example, the merchant might offer a lower discount amount after BFCM is finished, in which case the old discounts should no longer be valid. The merchant may also change the triggers for an offer such that the offer is only valid over $100, in which case any old discounts should no longer be valid.\n4. **Server:** Respond to the Checkout Extension with a `TamperProofCartAttribute`.\n    - **Action:** The server responds to the checkout extension's request with the newly generated `TamperProofCartAttribute`.\n5. **Checkout Extension:** Add the `TamperProofCartAttribute` to the cart.\n\n> Part 2. Apply a Discount from a `TamperProofCartAttribute` (Function)\n\n6. **Function:** Read the `TamperProofCartAttribute` and `TrustedState` from GraphQL input.\n    - **Security:**\n        - The `TrustedState` is composed of:\n            - `CheckoutData` from the GraphQL input. This is trusted because it is provided directly to the Function by Shopify's servers.\n            - A map of `ActiveOfferVersion`s from a discount private metafield. This is trusted because it can only be set from our server using the Admin API.\n7. **Function:** Verify that the `TamperProofCartAttribute` has not been tampered with.\n    - **Action:** The Function creates an HMAC signature from the data string of the `TamperProofCartAttribute` and the shared secret. The Function compares the HMAC that it generated against the HMAC from the `TamperProofCartAttribute`. If these are not equal, then the discount should **NOT** be applied.\n    - **Security:**\n        - This ensures that the attribute was generated by our server, and has not been modified (e.g., by the customer).\n        - This does **NOT** provide any indication of whether or not the state contained in the data of the `TamperProofCartAttribute` matches reality. The state must still be verified against the trusted state.\n        - This tells us that the _relationship_ between the `UnverifiedState` and the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified` is true. That is, if the `UnverifiedState` is true then our server says that the discount should be applied.\n8. **Function:** Verify the `UnverifiedState` using the `TrustedState`.\n    - **Action:** The Function compares the `UnverifiedState` from the `TamperProofCartAttribute` to the `TrustedState` from its GraphQL input. If these are not equal, then the discount should **NOT** be applied.\n    - **Security:**\n        - If the `TrustedState` matches the `UnverifiedState`, then it is safe to apply the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified`.\n        - If the states are not equal, then one of the following may have happened:\n            1. The request to the server was forged and sent with a `CheckoutData` that did not match reality, or\n            2. The `CheckoutData` has changed since the `TamperProofCartAttribute` was created, or\n            3. The `ActiveOfferVersion` has changed since the `TamperProofCartAttribute` (e.g., due to the merchant editing the offer)\n9. **Function:** Apply the `DiscountToApplyIfStateIsVerified` from the `TamperProofCartAttribute`, if all previous checks pass.\n\n### Editor\n\n**Discount Metafields**\n\n-   `$app:upsell-offer-discount-function.private-state`:\n    -   `activeOfferVersions`: A key-value map of offer ID to active version number. This is used by the Function as part of the `TrustedState`.\n-   `$app:upsell-offer-discount-function.private-shared-secret-key`: This is the shared secret between the server and the Function used to generate HMAC signatures. This value should be _unique_ for each discount code to limit the damage if a key is compromised.\n\n**Updating Offers**\n\nWhen a discounted offer is changed, the active version number must be incremented. The combination of the offer ID and the active version number are used to create a `ActiveOfferVersion`. When the version number is incremented, then any `ActiveOfferVersion` that uses the old version number becomes invalid.

But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nTo ensure a seamless onboarding experience for non-checkout stores, it's crucial to address the issue where these stores are currently able to select any pricing plan, contrary to the intended functionality that limits them to the Basic plan. This misalignment was identified following a recent update and needs to be corrected to maintain the integrity of the onboarding process.\n\n- Review the component responsible for plan selection during onboarding, specifically targeting the logic that should restrict non-checkout stores to the Basic plan.\n- If the `AcceptNoCheckout` component handles the plan options, update it to display only the Basic plan as selectable for non-checkout stores, while other plans should be grayed out and unselectable.\n- In the case that another component or hook, such as `useAvailablePlanIds`, is responsible for filtering available plans, ensure it is correctly identifying and restricting non-checkout stores to the Basic plan.\n- Implement unit tests to validate that non-checkout stores are only able to select the Basic plan, preventing any future regressions in this behavior.\n\nExample code modification for the component:\n\n```tsx\nconst AcceptNoCheckout = () => {\n  // ... existing code ...\n\n  // Logic to restrict non-checkout stores to the Basic plan\n  const plans = availablePlanIds.filter(planId => planId === BASIC_PLAN_ID);\n\n  return (\n    // ... render logic for plans, with only the Basic plan being selectable ...\n  );\n};\n```\n\nExample unit test to ensure correct behavior:\n\n```tsx\ndescribe('AcceptNoCheckout', () => {\n  it('should only allow non-checkout stores to select the Basic plan', () => {\n    // Setup for a non-checkout store context\n    // Render the AcceptNoCheckout component\n    // Assert that only the Basic plan is selectable and others are not\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThese steps and code snippets are provided as a guide, and the actual implementation should align with the existing codebase and component structure.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [web](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/tree/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web) \u2192 [client](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/tree/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client) \u2192 [src](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/tree/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client/src) \u2192 [pages](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/tree/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client/src/pages) \u2192 [onboarding](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/tree/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client/src/pages/onboarding)- [Lines 1 - 375](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/blob/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client/src/pages/onboarding/onboarding-pricing.page.tsx#L1-L375)\n\n The snippet provides insight into the frontend logic for onboarding pricing plan acceptance, which is directly related to the issue of non-checkout stores being able to select any pricing plan. \n\n\n   - [Lines 83 - 167](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/blob/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client/src/pages/onboarding/onboarding-pricing.page.tsx#L83-L167)\n\n This snippet shows the structure of the onboarding pricing page and includes conditional rendering based on checkout availability, which is relevant to the issue of plan selection for non-checkout stores. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 181](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/blob/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/docs/checkout-upsell-discounts.md#L1-L181)\n\n The snippet includes UI components for displaying and accepting pricing plans during onboarding, which is relevant to the issue as it involves the UI where the incorrect plan selection occurs. \n\n\n   - [Lines 169 - 221](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/blob/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/client/src/pages/onboarding/onboarding-pricing.page.tsx#L169-L221)\n\n This snippet is relevant for understanding the visual representation of available plans and identifying potential areas for restricting plan selection based on store type. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 372](https://github.com/testbed/aftersell/blob/2bef1cab3382ad4ba63493ce24d3793c96b2e103/web/server/src/modules/billing/billing.constants.ts#L1-L372)\n\n Provides details of pricing plans and components displayed during onboarding, which is necessary to investigate the incorrect plan selection issue."
