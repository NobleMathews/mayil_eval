    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the issue described in the ISSUE section or align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests locating and replacing the incorrect keyword argument in the codebase, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. The issue is about improving the error message in the Matplotlib library when incorrect keyword arguments are passed, not about fixing user code. The git diff shows changes to the error message and validation logic in the Matplotlib library, which the RESPONSE does not mention or address. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
