{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate explanation of how to implement the requested feature, which is to add a new hook/event to customize the base list for classes in Sphinx documentation. The RESPONSE outlines the steps to define the new event, modify the `add_directive_header` method to trigger the event, and allow the event handler to modify the `formatted_bases` list or return a new string. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets that illustrate how to add the event and trigger it, which aligns closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows the actual implementation of the event addition and the modification of the `add_directive_header` method to emit the `autodoc-process-bases` event with the necessary arguments. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it provides a conceptually accurate and actionable guide that would lead to a similar outcome. The RESPONSE also includes links to relevant code snippets in the Sphinx repository, which could be helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not provide the exact code changes shown in the git diff, but it is otherwise highly relevant and actionable.",
