    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Permutation` class constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles and apply them in left-to-right order, which is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE that describes a problem with the constructor failing with non-disjoint cycles. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff simplifies the error checking by removing the unnecessary condition that also checks for `is_cycle` when `has_dups(temp)` is `True`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, proposes a new method `_combine_cycles` and significant changes to the constructor logic, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's simpler and more direct solution to the problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
