    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and structured approach to identifying and fixing the issue of extraneous spaces in unit representations in the `Unicode` and `Console` classes. It correctly identifies the methods that need to be checked and provides a clear set of instructions for ensuring that spaces are added only when necessary for correct formatting. The RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff, which shows changes to the `to_string` method and related functions such as `_format_mantissa` and `_format_superscript` to ensure proper spacing. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring consistency across different formats, which is in line with the git diff's changes to multiple formatting classes. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's code changes but offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to eliminate extraneous spaces in unit representations. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes but gives a high-level overview of the steps to be taken, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
