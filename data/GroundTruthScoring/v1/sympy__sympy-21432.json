    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `powdenest` function to handle the case of `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` when `force=True`. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `powdenest` function in `sympy/simplify/powsimp.py` and suggests that the `force` parameter should be correctly applied to trigonometric functions. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable changes that align with the git diff. The git diff shows a more complex change involving a nested function `_denest` that handles the denesting of powers and uses a substitution approach to address the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention this nested function or the substitution approach, which are key elements of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating a `_denest_pow` helper function, which does not exist in the git diff or the provided codebase. The RESPONSE also includes a section with code snippets to check, which is not directly actionable and does not align with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the file and function to modify but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
