    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests updating the `TEMPLATES` configuration in `settings.py` to filter out empty strings, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to prevent empty strings from causing issues in the autoreload process. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that modifies `get_template_directories` in a way that is similar to the git diff, ensuring that empty strings are filtered out. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `Path(d)` instead of `cwd / to_path(d)`, which is a slight deviation from the git diff but still achieves the goal of filtering out empty strings. The RESPONSE does not include the additional condition `if directory and not is_django_path(directory)` found in the git diff, which is a minor omission but does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that no changes are required in other files that are not related to the issue, which shows a good understanding of the scope of the problem. Overall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue, despite minor differences from the git diff.",
