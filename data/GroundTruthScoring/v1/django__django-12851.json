    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `ifequal` template tag definition and its registration from `django/template/defaulttags.py`, which aligns with the intent of the ISSUE to remove `ifequal`. However, the RESPONSE fails to recognize that the git diff does not actually remove the `ifequal` tag but instead adds deprecation warnings using `RemovedInDjango40Warning`. The RESPONSE also suggests searching for any usage of `{% ifequal %}` within the template files and replacing them with the `{% if %}` tag, which is a reasonable step but is not reflected in the git diff provided. The RESPONSE does not mention adding deprecation warnings, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative approach.",
