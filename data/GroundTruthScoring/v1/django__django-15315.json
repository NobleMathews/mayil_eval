{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of the `Field.__hash__` method changing value after a field is assigned to a model. It suggests ensuring that the `__hash__` method returns a consistent hash value based on immutable attributes, which aligns with the git diff's approach of simplifying the `__hash__` method to only use the `creation_counter`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to review changes made in ticket #31750 and the context of ticket #26472, which is relevant to understanding the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest the exact change made in the git diff, which is to remove all parts of the hash computation except for the `creation_counter`. Instead, it suggests using other immutable attributes such as the field's name or type, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to add regression tests, which is a good practice but not part of the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for further investigation, which could be helpful for a developer but are not directly related to the specific change needed to fix the issue as per the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance, it does not perfectly align with every aspect of the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
