{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable steps that closely align with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_reverse_with_prefix` method to catch `ValueError` exceptions from `to_url`, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes the correct code snippet that needs to be changed, matching the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation to reflect the behavior of `to_url` and how to properly decline a match, which is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also suggests adding tests to ensure the new behavior works as expected, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly copy the git diff but provides an alternative explanation that achieves the same result, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that is almost identical to the git diff's solution.",
