{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a high-level overview of the steps needed to include the model class in the `app_list` context, which is the core of the issue. It correctly identifies the location of the changes (`django/contrib/admin/sites.py`) and the method to be modified (`_build_app_dict`). The RESPONSE also correctly suggests making the method public and updating the views that use the `app_list` context. The provided code snippet is a simplified example that aligns well with the git diff, showing the addition of the 'model' key to the dictionary returned by the `_build_app_dict` method. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests renaming the method to make it public, which is not reflected in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is addressed effectively. The RESPONSE also includes links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. The RESPONSE is not scored a 9 or 10 because it includes additional steps not present in the git diff, such as renaming the method and updating references, which, while potentially useful, are not part of the diff's solution.",
