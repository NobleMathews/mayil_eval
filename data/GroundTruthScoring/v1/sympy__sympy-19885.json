    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general troubleshooting steps for using 'linsolve' and 'solve' in SymPy, but it does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE nor does it align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in the '_gauss_jordan_solve' function within 'sympy/matrices/solvers.py', which indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the algorithm for solving linear systems, specifically by changing how the permutation matrix and free variable indices are handled. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests verifying symbol consistency, checking equation formulation, confirming correct usage of 'linsolve', and considering an alternative function 'solve_linear_system'. None of these suggestions are relevant to the changes made in the git diff, and they do not provide a solution to the problem of 'linsolve' returning an incorrect answer. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff and the issue described.",
