    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_print_Mul` method in the `sympy/printing/octave.py` file to handle the printing of complex numbers in Octave. The RESPONSE suggests adding a multiplication operator `*` between the real part and the imaginary unit `i`, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to ensure that the `*` is only added when necessary, which is consistent with the git diff's conditional check. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation of checking if `(S.ImaginaryUnit*expr).is_Integer`, but it achieves the same result by ensuring the multiplication operator is included for compatibility with Octave 4.0. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by referencing relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not exactly match the git diff's implementation detail, but it is still a highly relevant and effective solution.",
