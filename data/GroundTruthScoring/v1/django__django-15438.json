{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to modify the `get_select2_language` function to include a fallback to a language without the region code if the specific regional language code is not supported by Select2 translations. This aligns closely with the git diff, which also introduces a new function `get_select2_language` to handle the fallback logic. The RESPONSE's suggested changes to the function are consistent with the git diff's approach of using a while loop to strip the region code and find a supported language variant. Additionally, the RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the `SELECT2_TRANSLATIONS` dictionary if necessary, which is implied in the git diff by the presence of the `SELECT2_TRANSLATIONS` mapping. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, as it suggests a split on the hyphen and a direct check for the language without the region, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as it still achieves the desired outcome of providing a fallback language code. The RESPONSE also helpfully points to relevant code snippets for further investigation, which adds value for the developer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its high relevance and clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
