    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the command-line interface to handle the '.puml' extension correctly and to modify the 'validate_output_format' function, which is not present in the git diff. It also suggests updating the error message to include all supported formats, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a detailed help message listing available formats. However, the RESPONSE does not address the removal of 'check_graphviz_availability' from 'dot_printer.py' nor the addition of 'check_if_graphviz_supports_format' in 'main.py' and 'utils.py', which are key elements of the git diff. The RESPONSE also does not mention the creation of the 'DIRECTLY_SUPPORTED_FORMATS' tuple or the restructuring of the help message to include this tuple, which are significant changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the issue.",
