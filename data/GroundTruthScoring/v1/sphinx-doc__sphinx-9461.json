    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension and other related functions and modules to handle class methods decorated with both `@classmethod` and `@property`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement these updates. It mentions modifying functions and adding conditions without specifying what these modifications should be, which makes the RESPONSE lack actionable content. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which provides specific changes to the `sphinx/domains/python.py`, `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, and `sphinx/util/inspect.py` files to address the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the need to update the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension but fails to provide the necessary details and actionable steps that are present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2.",
