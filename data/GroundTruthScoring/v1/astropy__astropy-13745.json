    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_validate_angles` method in the `Latitude` class to handle `float32` inputs more robustly by casting them to `float64` before performing validation checks. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the `_validate_angles` method, but instead of casting all `float32` inputs to `float64`, the git diff specifically changes the limit value to be of the same type as the input angles' dtype when the unit is radians. Both approaches aim to address the precision issue with `float32` representations of pi/2.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to convert `float32` to `float64` before passing it to the `Latitude` constructor is a valid alternative approach to handling the precision issue, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. This approach would ensure that the validation checks are performed with sufficient precision.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises ensuring that the conversion from radians to degrees is done using `float64` precision if the input is in radians, which is implicitly addressed in the git diff by using the `dtype.type` of the input angles to set the limit.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is relevant to the issue and closely matches the git diff's approach to resolving the precision problem with `float32` representations of pi/2.",
