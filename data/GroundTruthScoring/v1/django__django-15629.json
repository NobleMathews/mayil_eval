    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the model fields to include the `db_collation` attribute, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the collation is set correctly for the primary key and foreign key fields. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which includes changes to the Django backend schema code to handle collation changes during field alteration, rather than altering the model definitions directly. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the Django framework that causes the foreign key constraint errors when the collation is changed. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets to check, which are not directly relevant to the solution and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the topic of collation, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
