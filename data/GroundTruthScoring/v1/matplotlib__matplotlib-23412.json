    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the linestyle parameter may not be passed correctly and considers the possibility of a bug in Matplotlib. It also suggests using a custom `PathEffect` as a workaround. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the handling of the `_dash_pattern` attribute within the `draw` method of a patch object, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not offer a direct solution to the issue but provides some general advice and points to relevant code snippets. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff. The score of 2 reflects that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not provide a clear or actionable solution to the issue.",
