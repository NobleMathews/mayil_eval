    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting a default value for `max_degree` in the `polytope_integrate` function when it is not provided. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, as the problem arises when `max_degree` is not specified. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which does not set a default value for `max_degree` but instead modifies the behavior of the function to handle cases when `expr` is not a list and `max_degree` is `None`. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that is not present in the git diff, suggesting to modify the function definition to include a default value for `max_degree`, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, which involves fixing the TypeError and refining the handling of `expr` and `max_degree` within the function.",
