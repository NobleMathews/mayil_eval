    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 4 indicates that the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as an `IndexError` related to label placement in contours and suggests reviewing the logic in `ContourLabeler.locate_label` and `ContourLabeler.too_close` methods. It also correctly points out the need to handle the case where `movetos < idx` results in an empty array, which is aligned with the git diff that changes the line `start = movetos[movetos < idx][-1]` to `start = movetos[movetos <= idx][-1]`. However, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest the exact change made in the git diff, which is to include the current index (`idx`) in the selection of `movetos`. Instead, it suggests adding a condition to handle the case of an empty array, which is a valid but different approach. The RESPONSE also provides additional guidance on incorporating the fix from a commit mentioned in the issue description and testing the fix, which is helpful but not directly related to the specific change in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to adjust the indexing to include the current index, which is the key change in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a somewhat different solution to the problem.",
