    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_db_prep_value` method in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` to include a call to `get_prep_value` when the value is not already prepared, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also includes the correct condition `if not prepared:` before calling `get_prep_value(value)`, which matches the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which would be helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed. The RESPONSE is highly relevant, offers clear guidance, and aligns perfectly with the git diff, making it a valuable contribution to resolving the issue.",
