    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `LookupDict` class in the `requests` library has a `__name__` attribute or adding it if feasible. It also recommends modifying the `restify` function in `sphinx/util/typing.py` to handle the absence of the `__name__` attribute gracefully. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the AttributeError mentioned in the ISSUE, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in various parts of the Sphinx autodoc extension, not the `restify` function or the `requests` library. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as adding checks for `None` docstrings, handling `AttributeError` in `add_content`, and modifying the handling of descriptors and uninitialized attributes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
