    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests manually adjusting the order of JavaScript files in the `Media` class to resolve the `MediaOrderConflictWarning` and ensure that `jquery.js` is loaded before `inlines.js`. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of script loading order, it does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem.\n\nThe git diff indicates that the underlying issue is addressed by changing the internal representation of CSS and JS media lists in the `Media` class, using properties to merge them dynamically. This is a more systemic solution that does not require manual ordering of scripts for each `ModelAdmin` or `InlineModelAdmin` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention or suggest modifying the internal structure of the `Media` class or using properties to handle the merging of media lists, which is the key aspect of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach and is only partially relevant to the issue described.",
