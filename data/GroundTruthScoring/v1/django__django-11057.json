    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or provides a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on ensuring that custom middleware is compatible with Django 2.2b1, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of the admin check not recognizing a subclass of `AuthenticationMiddleware`. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific problem described in the issue, which is the need for the admin check to allow subclasses of `AuthenticationMiddleware`. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `check_dependencies` function in `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` to use a new helper function `_contains_subclass` that checks for subclasses in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting. The RESPONSE fails to mention any changes to the admin checks or the introduction of a new function to handle subclass checking. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the specific issue described.",
