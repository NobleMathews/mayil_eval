    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of making `FileResponse` always set the `Content-Disposition` header. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `set_headers` method in the `FileResponse` class and provides a code snippet that sets the `Content-Disposition` header with a default value of 'inline' along with the filename when `as_attachment` is false. This aligns well with the git diff, which also modifies the `set_headers` method to ensure the `Content-Disposition` header is set regardless of the `as_attachment` value. The RESPONSE's code snippet is similar to the git diff in that it sets the disposition to 'attachment' if `as_attachment` is true and 'inline' otherwise, and it handles the filename encoding. However, the RESPONSE does not include the `elif self.as_attachment:` condition from the git diff that sets the `Content-Disposition` to 'attachment' when there is no filename, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. Despite this, the RESPONSE's solution is effective and relevant, and it would likely resolve the issue as described.",
