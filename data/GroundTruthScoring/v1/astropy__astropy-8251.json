    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the FITS standard does not support numeric factors in unit strings and advises to remove the numeric factor from the unit string before parsing it with `format='fits'`. This advice is incorrect and does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the actual solution involves modifying the parser rules to support additional cases of numeric factors with exponents, specifically allowing unsigned integers (UINT) to be used as exponents. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the need to update the parser rules and instead provides a workaround that does not address the core issue reported. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking various code snippets, none of which are relevant to the actual changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
