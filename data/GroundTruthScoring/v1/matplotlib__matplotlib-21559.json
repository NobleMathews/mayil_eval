{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of handling multiple datetime-based series in the `eventplot` function of matplotlib. It suggests converting `datetime.date` objects to matplotlib's internal float representation using `matplotlib.dates.date2num` before passing them to `plt.eventplot`. This is a valid workaround that addresses the TypeError encountered when passing datetime objects directly to the function.\n\nThe git diff shows changes to the `eventplot` method in the `_axes.py` file, which includes processing unit information differently and handling positions as a list of lists. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes in the git diff but offers an alternative solution that would allow the user to bypass the issue without modifying the matplotlib library code. The RESPONSE's solution is practical and can be implemented by the user in their own code, which makes it highly relevant.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the `eventplot` method to handle datetime objects natively. Instead, it provides a user-level solution. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a clear workaround, it does not align with the git diff's approach of fixing the issue within the library's code. This is why the RESPONSE is scored a 7, as it is highly relevant and actionable but does not match the git diff's internal code changes.",
