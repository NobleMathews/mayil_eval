    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is the lack of error handling for a ValueError raised by urlparse() in the CsrfViewMiddleware. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the _check_referer method to include a try-except block that catches ValueError and raises a RejectRequest with a reason of REASON_MALFORMED_REFERER. This aligns closely with the git diff, which adds a try-except block around the urlparse() call in the process_view method and returns self._reject(request, REASON_MALFORMED_REFERER) in case of a ValueError. The RESPONSE's alternative approach of modifying the _check_referer method instead of the process_view method is a valid and effective solution, as it addresses the same issue of handling malformed referer URLs. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that REASON_MALFORMED_REFERER is defined, which is consistent with the git diff. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the RESPONSE suggests raising a RejectRequest, which is not a pattern used in the git diff; instead, the git diff uses the existing self._reject method. However, this difference does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the core idea of handling the ValueError remains the same.",
