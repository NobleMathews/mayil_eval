    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting, ensuring correct migration order, replacing a reference in a migration file, deleting an erroneous migration, and squashing migrations. While these are general good practices when dealing with Django migrations, they do not directly address the specific issue of ManyToManyField references causing infinite migrations due to case sensitivity, which is what the git diff addresses by modifying the `related.py` to ensure model names are treated as case-insensitive.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide guidance on modifying the Django source code to handle case insensitivity in model references, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Instead, it focuses on migration management and settings configuration, which are only tangentially related to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it deals with migrations and model references, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nThe code snippet provided at the end of the RESPONSE does point to the relevant section of the Django codebase (`related.py`), which is where the git diff makes changes. However, the RESPONSE does not suggest the specific change needed, which is to lowercase the model names in the `deconstruct` method to prevent case sensitivity issues. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer a solution that would effectively resolve the issue as the git diff does.",
