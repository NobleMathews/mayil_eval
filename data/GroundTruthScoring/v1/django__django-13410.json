    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `lock` and `unlock` functions to check for `None` instead of catching `BlockingIOError` and to handle `OSError`. This approach is partially aligned with the git diff, which also uses a try-except block but specifically catches `BlockingIOError` instead of `OSError`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check for `None` is not necessary because the fcntl.flock function does not return a value on success, so the check for `None` is redundant and does not match the git diff's approach of simply returning `True` on success.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not fully address the issue described in the ISSUE, which is that the code always returns False due to the incorrect assumption that fcntl.flock returns a value. The git diff correctly updates the code to return `True` on success and `False` on failure by catching the appropriate exception (`BlockingIOError`), which is not reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides some actionable advice by suggesting the use of a try-except block, which is a step in the right direction. However, it fails to correctly identify the exception to catch based on the Python documentation and the git diff provided. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to check for `None` is not relevant to the issue and does not align with the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a correct alternative solution to the issue.",
