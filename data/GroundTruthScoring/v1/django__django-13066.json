{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided by the user aligns closely with the git diff and the issue description. It correctly identifies the need to update the `Argon2PasswordHasher` class to use Argon2id as the default type and to adjust the `memory_cost` and `parallelism` parameters to match the new upstream defaults. The RESPONSE also includes the correct import statement for `Type` from the `argon2` library and updates the `params` method to reflect the new default type as `Type.ID`. The code snippet provided in the RESPONSE matches the changes in the git diff, such as updating the `memory_cost` and `parallelism` values and using the `params` method to pass these values to the `hash_secret` function. The RESPONSE also correctly updates the `verify` method to use the `argon2.PasswordHasher().verify` method, which is in line with the git diff. The only minor discrepancy is that the RESPONSE does not explicitly mention the change in the `must_update` method to compare the current and new parameters, but this is a minor detail and does not significantly detract from the overall accuracy and utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE receives a high score of 9.",
