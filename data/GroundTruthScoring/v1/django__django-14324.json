    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the commit that caused the regression and checking the `contribute_to_class` method for incorrect settings of `related_name`. It also recommends ensuring the `related_name` follows the expected format and modifying the conditional logic if necessary. Additionally, it advises adding a test case to prevent future regressions.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided shows that the changes are made in the `__init__` method of the `RelatedField` class and other related classes, where the `related_name`, `related_query_name`, and `limit_choices_to` are being set as instance variables and used in the `deconstruct` method. The RESPONSE does not mention any changes to the `__init__` method or the `deconstruct` method, which are key elements of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of the `related_name` attribute for self-referential `ManyToManyField`. However, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide guidance on the specific changes needed in the code, which are clearly outlined in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
