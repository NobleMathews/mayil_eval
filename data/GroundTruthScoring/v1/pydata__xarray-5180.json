    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is to make the calendar comparison case-insensitive. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_is_standard_calendar` function to perform a case-insensitive comparison, which aligns with the git diff's approach of introducing the `_is_standard_calendar` function and using it to replace direct comparisons with `_STANDARD_CALENDARS`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that all other comparisons with calendar names in the code are case-insensitive, which is in line with the git diff's changes in various parts of the code.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the implementation details of the `_is_standard_calendar` function. The git diff does not show the creation of a new set with lowercase calendar names, but this difference does not affect the effectiveness of the RESPONSE's solution. The RESPONSE's alternative approach to achieving case-insensitive comparison is valid and would work effectively.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing out specific code snippets to check, which is helpful but not necessary for the fix. This additional information does not detract from the RESPONSE's value in addressing the main issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE closely matches the git diff's approach and provides a viable alternative solution to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 9.",
