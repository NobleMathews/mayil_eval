    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but may not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `clean` method in the form class to explicitly set the model instance's attributes from `cleaned_data`. While this approach could potentially allow `cleaned_data` to overwrite fields' default values, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff modifies the `construct_instance` function to check if the field's value is in `form[f.name].field.empty_values` before continuing with the default value. The RESPONSE does not address the specific logic change in the `construct_instance` function and instead offers a high-level solution that would require additional overriding of form methods. This approach is somewhat relevant because it deals with the manipulation of `cleaned_data`, but it does not provide a direct solution to the issue described or match the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the implementation of the feature, which does not add value to the solution.",
