    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps to investigate the issue with the linkcheck failures, including reviewing the changes in the commit and PR, checking the AnchorCheckParser, verifying the rewrite_github_anchor function, ensuring the linkcheck_anchors configuration is set, and considering reverting the changes as a last resort. These steps are somewhat aligned with the git diff, which shows a conditional check being added to the _check_uri method to only raise an exception for missing anchors if self.check_anchors is True.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff, which is the addition of the self.check_anchors condition. Instead, it provides a more general troubleshooting approach without mentioning the new condition that controls the anchor checking behavior. The RESPONSE also suggests checking various parts of the code and configuration that are not directly related to the git diff's solution. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a broad approach to troubleshooting the issue, it lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the new self.check_anchors condition, which is a key element in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reverting changes and reporting the issue to maintainers, which is not a solution but rather a last-resort action. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which could be helpful for a developer but are not directly related to the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and is partially relevant to the issue, but it does not closely match the git diff's approach and is incomplete in addressing the specific change that resolves the issue. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.",
