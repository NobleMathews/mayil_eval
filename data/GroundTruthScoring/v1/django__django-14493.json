    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the 'substitutions' variable being referenced before assignment when 'max_post_process_passes' is set to 0. It provides a clear and actionable solution that matches the git diff by suggesting the initialization of the 'substitutions' variable before the loop in the 'post_process' method. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates where to place the initialization of 'substitutions' to False, which is exactly what the git diff shows. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides context and rationale for the change, ensuring that the developer understands why the modification is necessary. The RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and addresses the issue comprehensively, making it deserving of a score of 10.",
