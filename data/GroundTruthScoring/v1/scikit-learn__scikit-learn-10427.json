    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the deprecated `imread` function from SciPy with `Image.open` from the PIL library, which is a valid approach to address the deprecation issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows that the correct solution involves creating a new `_pilutil.py` module within `sklearn/externals` and importing `imread` and `imresize` from there, rather than directly using `Image.open` from PIL in the `load_sample_images` function.\n\nThe RESPONSE also incorrectly states that no changes are required in the `_lfw.py` file, while the git diff indicates that changes are indeed necessary, including importing `imread` and `imresize` from the newly created `_pilutil.py` module.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant alternative solution to the deprecation of `imread`, but it does not match the git diff's approach and contains inaccuracies regarding the changes needed in other files. Therefore, it only partially addresses the issue and does not provide a complete or accurate solution.",
