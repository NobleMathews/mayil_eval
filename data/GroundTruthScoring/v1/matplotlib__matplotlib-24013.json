    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The solution could be attempted in multiple ways, the approach taken by the RESPONSE should not be penalized if it is different from the git diff, as long as it is effective and relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of function shadowing their module names. It suggests changing the import statement in the user's code to use the correct form, which aligns with the git diff's approach of renaming the submodule to avoid shadowing. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on how to access the `tripcolor` module if needed, which is relevant and helpful. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, as it does not include the renaming of the submodule to `_tripcolor`, but it offers a valid alternative approach by suggesting specific imports and a different way to access the module. This alternative is effective and relevant, and therefore, the RESPONSE should not be penalized for being different from the git diff. The score of 7 reflects that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
