    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately instructs the developer to locate the `only_relation_agnostic_fields` method within the `MigrationAutodetector` class in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` and replace the line `del deconstruction[2]['to']` with `deconstruction[2].pop('to', None)`. This change is exactly what is shown in the provided git diff, and it addresses the issue described, which is a `KeyError` being raised due to the 'to' key being missing in the deconstructed field dictionary.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes references to the relevant code snippets, which, while not necessary for the fix, do not detract from the accuracy of the solution. The RESPONSE is clear, actionable, and perfectly aligned with the git diff, providing the developer with the exact steps needed to resolve the issue.",
