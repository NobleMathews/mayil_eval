    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to fixing the issue with the `IterativeImputer` class's handling of the `imputation_order` parameter. It suggests reviewing the class definition and the method where the imputation sequence is generated, which is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to correct the logic for the `ascending` and `descending` order of imputation, aligning with the git diff's changes.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the exact lines to be modified in the `_get_ordered_idx` method. Instead, it offers a hypothetical example that does not directly correspond to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE also introduces hypothetical `roman` and `arabic` orders, which are not part of the issue or the git diff, potentially causing confusion.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly address the changes in the git diff, which involve reversing the slicing of the `ordered_idx` array for the `ascending` and `descending` options. While the RESPONSE is on the right track by focusing on the ordering logic, it does not provide the precise and actionable guidance that matches the git diff. Therefore, it is only partially relevant and incomplete in terms of offering a solution that aligns with the git diff.",
