    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive review of the areas in the code that could be causing the issue with queryset ordering when using reverse(). It suggests checking the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method, the `reverse_ordering` method, and the `reverse()` method on a queryset, which are all relevant to the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises to ensure that `Meta.ordering` is respected and to investigate the test case that may not be correctly testing the immutability of queryset ordering. These suggestions are in line with the git diff, which shows a change in the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method to prevent mutation by creating a copy of the field before reversing the ordering. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to run tests to confirm the resolution of the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not explicitly mention the addition of `field = field.copy()` as seen in the git diff, which is the specific change made to address the issue. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not perfectly align with the git diff, which prevents it from scoring a 10. A score of 7 is appropriate as the RESPONSE offers actionable advice that would likely lead to a similar solution as the git diff.",
