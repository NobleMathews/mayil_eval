    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting an update to the `eval` method of the `binomial` class to handle the case when `n` and `k` are equal and `n` is a positive integer. This aligns with the issue description that `binomial(n, n)` should simplify to 1 under certain assumptions. However, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff's approach. The git diff introduces a variable `d` to represent `n - k` and uses it to check for the conditions where the binomial should return 1 or 0. It also includes additional checks for when `n` is non-negative or not an integer, which are not present in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check if `n` is a positive integer is a subset of the git diff's broader condition checks. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the core issue but does not encompass all the cases handled by the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 for being actionable and partially matching the git diff but not being complete.",
