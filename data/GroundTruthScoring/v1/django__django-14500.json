    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `MigrationExecutor` class to correctly handle unapplying squashed migrations, which is aligned with the git diff's approach to the issue. It correctly identifies the need to iterate over the `replaces` attribute and mark each replaced migration as unapplied using the `record_unapplied` method, which is also what the git diff does by recording individual statuses for replaced migrations.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE goes further by suggesting updates to the `check_replacements` method and adding error handling, which are not part of the git diff. While these suggestions could be valuable, they are not directly related to the specific changes made in the git diff to address the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for the developer but are not part of the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is largely in line with the git diff, but it includes additional suggestions that are not reflected in the git diff. Therefore, it does not perfectly align with every aspect of the git diff, but it does offer a relevant and effective approach to resolving the issue.",
