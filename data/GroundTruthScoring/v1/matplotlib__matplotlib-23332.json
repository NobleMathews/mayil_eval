    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the design of the `figtext` function and adding type checks for the parameters `rotation`, `transform_rotates_text`, and `linespacing`. It also recommends raising a `TypeError` with a clear message if a list is passed to these parameters. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need for better error messages when incorrect parameter types are passed, it does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `text.py` file, adding a type check for the `linespacing` parameter using `_api.check_isinstance(Real, spacing=spacing)` and changes the import statement from `import numbers` to `from numbers import Real`. It also updates the `set_rotation` method to check if the `s` parameter is an instance of `Real`. The RESPONSE does not mention the use of `_api.check_isinstance` or the modification of the import statement, and it incorrectly focuses on the `figtext` function rather than the `Text` class where the changes are made. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the `transform_rotates_text` parameter, which is not part of the issue or the git diff. The RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
