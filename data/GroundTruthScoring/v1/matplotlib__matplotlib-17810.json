    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general troubleshooting steps for issues related to animations in Matplotlib, but it does not directly address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `update` function returns a tuple or list of artists, checking for generator exhaustion, avoiding modification of `fig` and `ax` after animation creation, and reviewing various methods within the `FuncAnimation` class for potential bugs.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by adding a try-except block around the `next(self.new_frame_seq())` call within the `_init_draw` method to handle the `StopIteration` exception and provide a warning to the user. The RESPONSE does not mention this solution or provide a similar alternative.\n\nThe RESPONSE does mention checking the `_init_draw` method and the `new_frame_seq` method, which are related to the git diff, but it does not provide specific instructions on how to modify these methods to handle the `StopIteration` exception. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to the code snippets, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer to review the relevant code, but it does not compensate for the lack of actionable guidance.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore, it receives a low score.",
