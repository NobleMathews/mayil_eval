{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is the incorrect string representation of the `MyChoice` enum when used in a `MyObject` instance. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the `__str__` method should return the value of the enum member and provides code to override the `__str__` method in the `MyChoice` class. This aligns well with the git diff, which also adds a `__str__` method to the `Choices` class to ensure the correct string representation is returned.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes additional guidance on ensuring the `MyObject` model uses `MyChoice` for the `choices` argument and that the tests are correctly checking the string representation. This is relevant and helpful for the developer to verify the fix.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly modify the `Choices` class as the git diff does but instead suggests modifying the `MyChoice` class. While this is a viable alternative, it is not as general a solution as the one provided in the git diff, which would apply to all subclasses of `Choices`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7, as it is highly relevant and offers a clear solution that achieves similar results to the git diff but does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the base class.",
