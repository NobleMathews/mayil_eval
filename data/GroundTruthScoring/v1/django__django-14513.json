    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and detailed steps to implement a feature that differentiates between fully applied migrations and \"soft\" applied migrations in the `showmigrations` command. It suggests modifying the `MigrationRecorder` class and the `showmigrations` command, which is aligned with the git diff's approach to addressing the issue. However, the RESPONSE proposes adding a new method `is_squashed_migration_recorded` to the `MigrationRecorder` class, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead uses the existing `applied_migrations` method from the `MigrationRecorder` to check for recorded migrations. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using a different symbol ('[~]') to indicate \"soft\" applied migrations, whereas the git diff opts for a message \"Run 'manage.py migrate' to finish recording.\" with a '[-]' symbol. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the exact implementation details but does offer a viable alternative approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a step to update the help text and documentation, which is not covered in the git diff but is a valuable addition for user understanding. Overall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is partially aligned with the git diff, but it does not match the git diff's exact solution.",
