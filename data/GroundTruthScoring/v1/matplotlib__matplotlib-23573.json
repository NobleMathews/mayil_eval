    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. It should receive a score between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of how to address issues with Sphinx documentation and module structure in the context of the `matplotlib.axes` module. It suggests checking Sphinx configuration, using explicit directives for documenting classes, and considering refactoring for consistent import paths. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which shows significant changes to the module structure and class definitions within the `matplotlib` library. The git diff indicates a refactoring that removes the `_subplots.py` file and integrates its contents into `_base.py`, among other changes. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes or provide guidance on how to implement or reflect such changes in the documentation. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks the actionable content needed to assist the developer in fixing the issue described.",
