    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the `__eq__` method in `expressions.py`, as well as looking into `compiler.py` and possibly overriding the `order_by()` method on the `Listing` model's manager. While the RESPONSE correctly identifies that the issue is related to the ordering of querysets after a union operation and that the `__eq__` method is involved, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `identity` method within `expressions.py`, where the identity of a field is now determined by a tuple of the model's label and the field's name, rather than just the field's type. This is a specific fix that addresses the issue of distinguishing between fields of the same type in a union operation. The RESPONSE, however, does not mention this approach and instead provides a general suggestion to review and modify related code without specific instructions. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general area of the problem but lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
