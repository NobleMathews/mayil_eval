    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue of the `ProtocolError` not being wrapped correctly in the `requests` library. It suggests updating the library, ensuring that `ProtocolError` is caught and wrapped, and modifying the `except` block in `adapters.py` to catch `ProtocolError`. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is similar to the git diff, suggesting to catch both `ProtocolError` and `OSError` and raise a `ConnectionError`. The git diff shows that `ProtocolError` and `socket.error` are being caught, which is a slight difference from the RESPONSE's suggestion of `OSError`. However, `socket.error` is a subclass of `OSError`, so the RESPONSE's suggestion is still valid and would achieve a similar result. The RESPONSE also provides additional guidance on testing the changes and checking other code snippets for related issues, which is valuable for a comprehensive fix. The RESPONSE does not mention updating the import statement for `ProtocolError`, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
