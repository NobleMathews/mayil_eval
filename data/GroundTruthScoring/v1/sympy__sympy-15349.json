    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests identifying the incorrect output and correcting the sign of the sine function in the `to_rotation_matrix()` method, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly identifies the matrix element to be changed as `m01` and suggests changing the sign of the sine function in the wrong line of code. The git diff shows that the actual change needed is in the `m12` element, where the sign before `q.b*q.a` should be negative. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff and provides incorrect guidance on which line to change, leading to a score of 2. It does not provide a viable alternative solution and would not help the developer fix the issue correctly.",
