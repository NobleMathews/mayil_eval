    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of the steps needed to implement the feature request described in the issue. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method in `django/db/migrations/loader.py` and suggests a code change that is very similar to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE's code snippet includes the correct logic to check if `module.__path__` is an instance of `list` when `__file__` is None, which aligns with the git diff's approach to addressing the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests using `hasattr(module, \"__path__\")` before the `__file__` and `__path__` checks, while the git diff places this check after the new `__file__` and `__path__` condition. However, this difference does not significantly impact the effectiveness of the solution, and the RESPONSE still achieves the same result as the git diff. Therefore, it is not penalized for this minor discrepancy.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the explanatory comments found in the git diff that provide additional context about namespace packages and their properties according to Python's documentation. These comments are valuable for understanding the rationale behind the changes and ensuring future maintainers comprehend the purpose of the code. The absence of these comments makes the RESPONSE slightly less complete compared to the git diff.",
