    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described, offering guidance on how to update the `_eval_is_real` and `_eval_is_finite` methods for `cosh`, `sinh`, and `tanh` in the `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` file. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that for `cosh` and `sinh`, `_eval_is_real` should return `True` if the argument is real or purely imaginary, and `_eval_is_finite` should always return `True`. This aligns well with the git diff, which implements similar logic. For `tanh`, the RESPONSE correctly states that `_eval_is_real` should return `True` if the argument is real and provides additional conditions for when `_eval_is_finite` should return `True` or `False`, which is also in line with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE also suggests removing any unnecessary checks or incorrect logic, which is a valid recommendation given the context of the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes or the detailed conditions for the imaginary part checks as seen in the git diff, which would have made it a perfect match. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its high relevance and clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
