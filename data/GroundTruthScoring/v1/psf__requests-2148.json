    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to add a try-except block to catch `socket.error` and wrap it in a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a catch for `socket.error` and raising a `ConnectionError`. However, the RESPONSE also includes suggestions that are not supported by the git diff, such as ensuring that `ElementTree.fromstring(response.text)` is within a try block and modifying `requests/adapters.py`. These additional suggestions do not align with the git diff and are not necessary for resolving the issue described. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the main concern of catching `socket.error`, but it goes beyond the scope of the git diff by suggesting changes in files and methods not mentioned in the diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 4 for providing some actionable advice that partially matches the git diff but also includes unnecessary suggestions.",
