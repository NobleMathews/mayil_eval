    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the methods _print_Min and _print_Max to the PythonCodePrinter class, which aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE provides the correct Python code that should be added to handle the Min and Max functions, which is consistent with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE also includes additional guidance on ensuring that these methods are part of the PythonCodePrinter class and not the SymPyPrinter class, which is not directly related to the git diff but is still relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for reference, which is helpful but not strictly necessary for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention the update to the _known_functions dictionary, which is a key part of the git diff and necessary for the complete resolution of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match to the git diff but provides a highly relevant and actionable solution that would significantly aid the developer in fixing the issue.",
