    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `writeorg` method in the `SysCapture` and `SysCaptureBinary` classes, specifically the handling of data encoding and writing to the original file descriptor. The RESPONSE, however, suggests reviewing and potentially modifying a `decode` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises checking for unit tests and searching for references to the issue number, which are general good practices but do not offer specific guidance related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly states that the provided code snippets can be ignored, which is misleading as the git diff is directly related to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
