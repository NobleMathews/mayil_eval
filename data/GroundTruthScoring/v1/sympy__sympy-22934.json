    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue and suggests areas to investigate, such as the `FracElement` class and the `QQ` class or module. It also correctly identifies that the issue is related to the handling of reciprocal elements like `1/x`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a simple addition of two lines to handle the case where `1/expr` is in the mapping, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests checking various methods and classes without pinpointing the exact change needed. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and lacks the precision and directness that would make it highly valuable. Therefore, it receives a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
