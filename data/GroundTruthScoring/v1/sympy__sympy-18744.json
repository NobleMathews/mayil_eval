    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue lies in the string representation or comparison methods of matrix-related classes and provides a general approach to resolving the issue by ensuring that the `MatrixSymbol` class and related matrix expression classes handle operations with the imaginary unit `I` correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable changes to the code and instead points to areas of the codebase that are not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff. The git diff specifically modifies the `_print_MatMul` method in `sympy/printing/str.py` to handle the case when the coefficient `c` is a complex number with a negative real or imaginary part. The RESPONSE fails to identify the correct location of the issue and does not offer a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach to checking for negative real or imaginary parts of the coefficient. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in guiding the developer to the correct solution and only receives a score of 1 for acknowledging the issue with the imaginary unit `I` and the `MatrixSymbol` class.",
