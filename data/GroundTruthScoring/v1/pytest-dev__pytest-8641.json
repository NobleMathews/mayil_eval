{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `LEVELNAME_FMT_REGEX` in the `ColoredLevelFormatter` class to match the precision formatting in the log level name, which is the core issue described and addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests testing the changes with the specified log format string in `pytest.ini`, which is a good practice to confirm the fix.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes a lengthy section with code snippets to check, which are not relevant to the issue at hand. This part of the RESPONSE does not provide additional value and could potentially distract from the main solution. Despite this, the RESPONSE does not offer incorrect solutions or advice, and the main guidance provided is relevant and actionable. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate as it reflects the RESPONSE's alignment with the git diff and its effectiveness in addressing the issue, despite the inclusion of irrelevant code snippet checks.",
