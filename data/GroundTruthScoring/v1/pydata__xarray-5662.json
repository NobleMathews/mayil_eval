    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting display options in xarray to limit the output, which is a valid approach to managing the readability of large datasets. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involves modifying the internal representation functions to dynamically calculate the number of rows to display and to format the dimensions more effectively. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not offer actionable guidance on how to implement the necessary changes to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
