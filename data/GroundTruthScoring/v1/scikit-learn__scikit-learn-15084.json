    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking data types, updating the VotingClassifier to use 'soft' voting, and ensuring that only classifiers are used within the VotingClassifier. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by refactoring the base classes for ensemble methods, specifically by introducing a new base class _BaseHeterogeneousEnsemble and modifying the inheritance of _BaseVoting and _BaseStacking. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. It focuses on user-level checks and configurations rather than addressing the underlying implementation in the sklearn library, which was the focus of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would assist a developer in fixing the issue as per the git diff.",
