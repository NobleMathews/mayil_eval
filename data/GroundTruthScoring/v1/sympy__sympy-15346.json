    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `trigsimp` function instead of `simplify` for trigonometric expressions involving `Rational` numbers, which is a relevant and actionable piece of advice. It also suggests manually applying trigonometric identities if `trigsimp` does not work, and reporting the issue if it persists. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which involves reordering the application of trigonometric simplification rules within the `trigsimp` function itself. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it points to the correct module and function (`sympy.simplify.trigsimp`) that is being modified in the git diff, but it does not provide guidance on the specific change made (moving `TRmorrie` after `TR10i`). Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully resolve the issue as the git diff does. The RESPONSE is somewhat helpful but incomplete in the context of the git diff.",
