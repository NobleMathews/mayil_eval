    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `facet` method in the `Plot` class to handle empty facets gracefully and to ensure that the `vectorize` function can handle empty inputs by setting the `otypes` argument. While the RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to handle empty inputs and the `otypes` argument, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows that the issue was addressed by removing the `allow_empty` variable and adding a condition to yield only non-empty data frames in the `split_generator` function. Additionally, the git diff includes a change to the `stringify` function in the `scales.py` file to specify `otypes=['object']`, which is somewhat aligned with the RESPONSE's suggestion to handle `otypes`. However, the RESPONSE's proposed changes to the `facet` method and the `FacetGrid` class are not supported by the git diff and do not directly address the traceback provided in the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, and therefore, it receives a low score.",
