    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and relevant solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `desc_sig_element` class to include a `_sig_element` class attribute and to use the `__init_subclass__` hook to automatically add subclasses to the `SIG_ELEMENTS` list. This aligns with the git diff, which introduces a similar mechanism using the `_sig_element` keyword argument. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `SigElementFallbackTransform` class to handle the fallback logic, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to the `fallback` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the correct approach to add an `_sig_node_type` attribute to preserve information about the original `desc_sig_*` type, which is a key aspect of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly in terms of the implementation details, such as the specific way of adding classes to the `SIG_ELEMENTS` set or the exact changes to the `fallback` method. Despite these differences, the RESPONSE offers a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, and therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
