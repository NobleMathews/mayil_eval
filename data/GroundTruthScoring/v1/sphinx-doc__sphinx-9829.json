    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue of deferring the loading of MathJax. It suggests modifying the `install_mathjax` function and adding a new configuration option to allow users to specify their preference for loading MathJax with either `async` or `defer`. This approach is highly relevant to the issue and offers a solution that achieves a similar result to the git diff, which changes the loading method from `async` to `defer`. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests adding a new configuration option rather than directly changing the option within the code. However, it provides a viable alternative that gives users more flexibility and control over the loading method, which aligns with the issue's request for a way to change `async` to `defer`. The RESPONSE also includes steps for implementation and updates to documentation, which are valuable for a developer looking to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not score higher because it does not directly match the git diff's approach of simply changing the option from `async` to `defer` without introducing a new configuration option.",
