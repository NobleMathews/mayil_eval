    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff. It suggests modifying the migration file to remove the 'title' field from the 'Readable' model before creating the 'Book' model with its own 'title' field. This advice is in line with the git diff's intent to handle dependencies correctly when a field is moved from a parent model to a subclass in the same migration. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific implementation details provided in the git diff, such as adding dependencies for the removal of base fields if the new model has a field with the same name. Instead, it focuses on manually adjusting the migration file, which is a less automated and potentially error-prone approach compared to the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is helpful in guiding the developer to consider the order of operations in migrations but does not provide the complete solution that the git diff does. Therefore, it is partially relevant and warrants a score of 4.",
