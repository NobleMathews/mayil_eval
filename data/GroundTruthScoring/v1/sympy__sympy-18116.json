    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing `EvalfMixin` from `Relational`, implementing type-checking in `Expr` methods, refactoring the class hierarchy, and ensuring method overrides in `Relational` are appropriate. However, the git diff does not reflect any of these changes. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to various files, including adding multiplication methods to `array_utils.py`, implementing new decorators in `decorators.py`, and refactoring methods in `expr.py`, `numbers.py`, `sets.py`, `trigsimp.py`, and `ode.py` to use the new decorators for automatic sympification of method arguments.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves enhancing the codebase with decorators to handle sympification and type-checking, rather than the structural changes suggested in the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as per the git diff's solution.",
