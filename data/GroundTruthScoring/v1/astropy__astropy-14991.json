    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the file and the line where the change needs to be made, and it provides the correct replacement code. However, it does not include the additional context and references added in the git diff, which are important for documentation and understanding the rationale behind the change.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly instructs the developer to locate the `w0wzcdm.py` file and navigate to the specific line that needs to be changed (line 205). It provides the correct replacement code, which matches the git diff's correction of the exponent from negative to positive. However, the RESPONSE omits the additional documentation and references that the git diff includes, such as the reference to Linder (2003) and the explanation in the Notes section. These additions are important for maintaining comprehensive documentation and providing context for the change. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the issue, but this is not directly related to the git diff's content.",
