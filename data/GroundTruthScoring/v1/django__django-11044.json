{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the initialization of `self.data` and `self.files` with `QueryDict` and `MultiValueDict` respectively, which partially aligns with the git diff. The git diff indicates that both `self.data` and `self.files` should be initialized with `MultiValueDict`, not `QueryDict` for `self.data`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to use `MultiValueDict` for `self.files` but incorrectly suggests `QueryDict` for `self.data`. This misalignment with the git diff means the RESPONSE does not fully address the issue as described. However, the RESPONSE does provide actionable advice and includes code snippets that are relevant to the issue, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
