    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests sorting the `yCoord` list to ensure it is monotonic before using it in the `combine_by_coords` function. This advice does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `combine_by_coords` function itself to only check the monotonicity of dimensions that are in `concat_dims` rather than all dimensions in `concatenated.dims`. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific issue described, which is that `combine_by_coords` should not raise an error when coordinate dimensions do not vary between datasets, even if they are non-monotonic. The RESPONSE does not provide a solution to the actual problem within the `combine_by_coords` function and instead suggests a workaround that is outside the scope of the function's intended behavior. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
