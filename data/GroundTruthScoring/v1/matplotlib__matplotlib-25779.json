    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of plotting an ellipse with an arrow indicating rotation, which is the core problem described in the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the example file `ellipse_arrow.py` and using the `FancyArrowPatch` to draw the arrow, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of using `MarkerStyle` and `plot` method. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff adds two new methods `get_vertices` and `get_co_vertices` to the `Ellipse` class in `patches.py` and uses these methods in the example file to determine the arrow's position. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a different approach by creating a separate function `add_rotation_arrow` and using `FancyArrowPatch` without modifying the `Ellipse` class. While the RESPONSE's approach is actionable and relevant, it does not match the git diff's approach of extending the `Ellipse` class functionality. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant but incomplete in terms of aligning with the git diff, warranting a score of 4.",
