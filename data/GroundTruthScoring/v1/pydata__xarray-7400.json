    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature described in the issue, which is to handle the case where two datasets have disjoint variables by adding the missing variable with `np.nan` as the fill value. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `concat` function to accept a new parameter `fill_value` with a default value of `np.nan` and provides a rough implementation outline, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff. The git diff shows more complex changes, including updating the `process_subset_opt` function to handle the 'all' option differently, modifying the `_parse_datasets` function to return an additional list of variables in order of appearance, and adding logic to handle reindexing variables that are not present in all datasets. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the need to handle reindexing, which are key parts of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to handle missing variables without raising an exception and to fill them with `np.nan`, which is relevant to the issue. However, it lacks the detailed changes shown in the git diff, such as the use of `reindex_variables` and the handling of variable order. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff, warranting a score of 4.",
