    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. It correctly identifies the incorrect conversion factor between `coulomb` and `statcoulomb` and provides the exact change needed to fix the issue, which matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating the unit test to reflect the correct conversion factor. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not mention the changes to the other units such as `ampere`, `volt`, `ohm`, `farad`, and `henry`, which are also part of the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the core issue with the conversion factor between `coulomb` and `statcoulomb` and provides the correct solution to fix it, which is in line with the git diff. It also correctly advises updating the unit test to ensure it reflects the correct conversion factor. However, it does not address the changes to other units that are included in the git diff, which are also relevant to the issue at hand. Despite this, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the main issue.",
