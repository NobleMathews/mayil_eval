    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to address the issue with `LassoCV` not using `precompute=True` for the final fit even if specified by the user. It correctly identifies the location of the issue in the `coordinate_descent.py` file and the `LinearModelCV.fit()` method. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `precompute` parameter is correctly set based on the user's input before the final `model.fit()` call, which is aligned with the intention of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific implementation details that are present in the git diff, such as checking if `precompute` is an instance of `str` and equals 'auto' before setting it to `False`. Instead, it suggests setting `self.precompute` to a user-defined value, which is not present in the git diff and does not account for the condition where `precompute` might be 'auto'. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but lacks the precision and completeness of the git diff.",
