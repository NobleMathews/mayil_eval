    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable guide that closely aligns with the git diff. It offers a clear explanation of the necessary changes to implement high-resolution plot directives, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `FigureMpl` class to handle the `srcset` attribute and updating `plot_directive.py` to generate multiple resolution images, which is consistent with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use `FigureMpl` instead of the standard figure directive when `plot_srcset` is configured, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a high-level overview of the changes, code snippets, and an emphasis on updating documentation, which are all relevant to the issue at hand.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff by suggesting modifications to the `FigureMpl` class and `plot_directive.py` to support high-resolution images. It also correctly identifies the need to handle the `srcset` attribute and generate multiple resolution images based on the `plot_srcset` configuration. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use `FigureMpl` instead of the standard figure directive when `plot_srcset` is configured is directly supported by the git diff, which adds the `matplotlib.sphinxext.figmpl_directive` to the extensions in `conf.py`. The RESPONSE's emphasis on updating documentation and providing examples is also in line with the git diff, which includes extensive comments and documentation within the new `figmpl_directive.py` file.",
