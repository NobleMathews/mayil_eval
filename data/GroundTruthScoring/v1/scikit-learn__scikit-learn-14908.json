    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `fit` method of the `DummyClassifier` to include a check for the presence of the constant value in the training data and to raise a `ValueError` with an informative message if the value is not found. This aligns well with the git diff, which also modifies the `fit` method to enhance the error message when the constant value is not present in the training data.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly. The git diff includes a loop to handle multiple outputs (`for k in range(self.n_outputs_):`) and constructs the error message using the actual values present in the training data (`list(self.classes_[k])`). The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests using `np.unique(y)` to determine the possible values, which is a different approach but still achieves the goal of providing the user with the necessary information to resolve the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the loop to handle multiple outputs, which is a key aspect of the git diff. This omission means that the RESPONSE does not fully account for scenarios where there are multiple target values (multi-output classification). Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it is not as comprehensive as the git diff, which justifies a score of 7.",
