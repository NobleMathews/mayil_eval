    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests adding a new keyword argument to the `contour()` function and modifying the `_process_contour_level_args()` method to check for the override flag before setting the levels to `[self.zmin]`. The RESPONSE also includes a high-level overview of the changes to be made and how to use the new feature, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of overriding the autoscaling behavior of contour levels. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_process_contour_level_args()` method and suggests adding a new keyword argument, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of simply removing the problematic code block. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it proposes adding a new argument and a conditional check, whereas the git diff removes the code block that causes the issue. However, the RESPONSE's solution is effective and relevant, providing a way to preserve the warning message and the original behavior when the override flag is not set, which could be seen as an enhancement over the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes, but it gives a clear direction on how to implement the solution, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
