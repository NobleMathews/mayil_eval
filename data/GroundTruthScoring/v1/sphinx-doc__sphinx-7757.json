    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating Sphinx to the latest version, creating a custom Sphinx extension, modifying the `_pseudo_parse_arglist` function, ensuring the extension is included in the `conf.py`, and reporting the issue to the maintainers if it persists. While these are general troubleshooting steps that could be relevant to various issues, they do not align with the git diff provided, which shows specific changes to the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to handle default values for positional-only arguments. The RESPONSE does not mention any changes to `sphinx/util/inspect.py` or the handling of defaults in the signature, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader context of the issue with Sphinx documentation rendering, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
