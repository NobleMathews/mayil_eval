    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue. The git diff shows changes made to the LaTeX writer in the Sphinx project, specifically modifying the handling of terms in the LaTeX output to ensure newline separation. The RESPONSE, however, suggests verifying and possibly customizing the LaTeX package configuration for the `:samp:` role, which is unrelated to the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE mentions `sphinx.js` files and localization, which are not relevant to the LaTeX rendering issue. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not address the specific issue of newline separation in LaTeX output.",
