    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to update the `KeyTransformIsNull` class's `as_sql` method for SQLite and Oracle to handle the distinction between a missing key and a key with a null value, which aligns with the git diff's changes to the `as_oracle` and `as_sqlite` methods. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating the `test_isnull_key` test case to ensure it tests the behavior of `__isnull=True` for different databases, including SQLite and Oracle, which is a necessary step to confirm the fix. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `JSON_EXISTS`, `JSON_QUERY`, or `JSON_VALUE` for Oracle, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff uses a different approach by leveraging the existing `HasKey` class and adjusting the SQL query. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact SQL changes needed, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not perfectly align with the git diff's approach, warranting a score of 7.",
