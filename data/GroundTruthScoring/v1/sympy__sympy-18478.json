    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and help the developer fix the issue in the software repository.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides an explanation of the behavior of the substitution operation in SymPy when substituting `x` with `oo` (infinity) for different expressions. However, it does not offer any actionable guidance or solution to address the issue described. The git diff indicates that a change was made to the `sympy/core/add.py` file to include `AccumBounds` in the condition that checks for `coeff.is_Number`. This suggests that the issue was resolved by modifying the code to handle `AccumBounds` correctly during the addition operation.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention any code changes or suggest a fix related to the handling of `AccumBounds` or any other code modification. It only provides a theoretical explanation of the behavior of the substitution operation, which does not help the developer fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. It is somewhat relevant to the issue as it discusses the behavior of the substitution operation, but it lacks actionable content, which is why it receives a score of 1.",
