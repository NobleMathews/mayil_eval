{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to implement the `add_indicator` parameter in the `SimpleImputer` class, which is the main focus of the issue. It suggests modifying the `__init__` method to include the new parameter, fitting a `MissingIndicator` during the `fit` method, and transforming the data using the `MissingIndicator` during the `transform` method. Additionally, it correctly identifies the need to concatenate the output of the `MissingIndicator` with the output of the imputer's `transform` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a high-level overview of the changes needed in the `SimpleImputer` class, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE includes the addition of the `add_indicator` parameter in the `__init__` method, the fitting of the `MissingIndicator` in the `fit` method, and the transformation logic in the `transform` method. It also correctly mentions the need to handle the `add_indicator` parameter in the `fit_transform` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it provides a valid and effective alternative approach to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use existing methods from the `_BaseImputer` class is a reasonable assumption, although the git diff does not show these methods being used. This does not detract from the RESPONSE's value, as it still offers a viable solution to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for developers looking to understand the context of the changes within the larger codebase. However, these links and the mention of the `_BaseImputer` class are not directly related to the git diff provided, which is why the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score.",
