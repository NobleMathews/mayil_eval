    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 1 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which suggests a specific change in the `fit` method of the `coordinate_descent.py` file by ensuring that the input data X is checked as a 'csc' matrix with a specified dtype of either np.float64 or np.float32. The RESPONSE, however, provides general troubleshooting steps that are not directly related to the git diff's approach to solving the issue. It suggests checking data centering, binary feature formatting, random seed, number of alphas, feature scaling, and reviewing the `fit` method implementation, none of which are mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution to the issue of `MultiTaskLassoCV` returning incorrect results with binary features and `fit_intercept=True`. The RESPONSE does not address the specific change in data type handling that the git diff indicates as the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not effective in guiding the developer to implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
