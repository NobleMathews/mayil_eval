    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the issue with unpacking a `Bbox` object and suggests modifying the `matplotlib.axes.Axes.table` method to handle a `Bbox` instance correctly. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that checks for the type of `bbox` and unpacks it accordingly, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, as it includes an additional type check and error message, but it achieves the same result and is a valid alternative approach.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the core issue described in the ISSUE, which is the inability to unpack a `Bbox` object as if it were a list or tuple. The proposed solution involves adding a type check to handle `Bbox` instances correctly, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of checking the type of `self._bbox` and using `self._bbox.bounds` if it is a `Bbox` object. The RESPONSE also suggests raising a `TypeError` if the `bbox` is neither a `Bbox` instance nor a list/tuple of four elements, which is a reasonable addition for robust error handling, even though it is not included in the git diff. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively.",
