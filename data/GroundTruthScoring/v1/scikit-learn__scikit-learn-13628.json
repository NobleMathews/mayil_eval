    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps that are relevant to the issue of incorrect Brier score loss calculations when the target contains only one class. It suggests checking and modifying the logic for inferring `pos_label`, binarizing `y_true` based on `pos_label`, and ensuring that the Brier score calculation handles uniform `y_true` correctly. These steps are in line with the changes made in the git diff, which also adjusts the handling of `pos_label` and the binarization of `y_true`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the removal of the `_check_binary_probabilistic_predictions` function and its replacement with inline checks within the `brier_score_loss` function, as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to add a check for uniform `y_true` after binarization, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet for the Brier score calculation that is already present in the original code and does not represent a change suggested by the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the changes made to other functions such as `calibration_curve`, `precision_recall_curve`, and `roc_curve`, which are part of the git diff. While these changes are not directly related to the `brier_score_loss` function, they are part of the overall solution to the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant and actionable advice that aligns with parts of the git diff but is incomplete and does not address all the changes necessary to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.",
