    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the feature to prohibit unknown redirects while allowing specified ones, which is the core issue described. It suggests modifying the configuration to accept pairs of URLs, updating the 'allowed_redirect' function, modifying the 'check' function, updating the 'process_result' function, ensuring correct compilation in the 'compile_linkcheck_allowed_redirects' function, and connecting the new compile function in the 'setup' function. These steps are in line with the git diff provided, which also modifies these functions and adds the 'linkcheck_allowed_redirects' configuration value.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests using a different configuration name ('linkcheck_allowed_redirects_pairs') and a separate compile function ('compile_linkcheck_allowed_redirects_pairs'), but these differences do not detract from the effectiveness of the solution. The RESPONSE's alternative approach still achieves the same result as the git diff: allowing certain redirects while prohibiting others.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a step to update the documentation, which is not mentioned in the git diff but is a good practice when introducing new features or configuration options.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, providing an effective alternative approach to achieve the desired functionality. Therefore, it receives a high score.",
