    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not offer a solution that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the seaborn library's code to handle a KeyError by returning a default color value when the 'norm' attribute is None. This is a direct fix to the issue described, where a KeyError occurs due to a missing entry in the lookup table for the 'hue' parameter in a scatterplot within a PairGrid.\n\nThe RESPONSE, however, does not address the KeyError or provide a code-based solution. Instead, it offers general troubleshooting steps that are not directly related to the code change shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests checking for missing values, handling data types, and downgrading or upgrading Seaborn versions, which are not actionable in the context of the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. It does not address the specific KeyError or TypeError that occurs in the seaborn library's code. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the 'hue' parameter and the use of PairGrid, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. A score of 2 is appropriate as it acknowledges the issue but does not offer a viable solution.",
