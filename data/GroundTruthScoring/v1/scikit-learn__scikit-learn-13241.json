{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of sign inconsistency in KernelPCA results. It suggests implementing a function to align the signs of the eigenvectors with a reference, which is a valid approach to ensuring consistent output across different runs. This aligns with the git diff's approach of using the `svd_flip` function to enforce deterministic output by flipping the eigenvectors' sign. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the use of `svd_flip`, but the alternative solution it proposes is effective and relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a sample implementation and usage example, which adds value by giving the developer actionable guidance. However, it does not match the git diff exactly, as it suggests a custom implementation rather than using the existing `svd_flip` utility from `sklearn.utils.extmath`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its high relevance and clear guidance that achieves a similar result to the git diff.",
