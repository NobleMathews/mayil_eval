    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `_query_cpu()` function to ensure it never returns 0 when `--jobs=0` is used, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a check for `avail_cpu == 0` and setting `avail_cpu` to 1. However, the RESPONSE introduces an unnecessary check for the command-line argument `--jobs=0` within the `_query_cpu()` function, which is not present in the git diff and is not needed since the issue is with the calculation of available CPUs, not the parsing of command-line arguments. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `check_parallel()` function to interpret `--jobs=0` as using all available CPUs, which is not related to the issue described and is not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff, as it includes unnecessary changes and does not focus solely on the calculation issue within the `_query_cpu()` function. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in addressing the issue as described and represented in the git diff.",
