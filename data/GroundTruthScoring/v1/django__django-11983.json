    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `date_hierarchy` function in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_list.py`, adjusting SQL generation logic, and ensuring timezone conversion accounts for DST. However, the git diff indicates that the changes needed are in `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py`, specifically in the `get_filters` method, not in the `admin_list.py` file or the `date_hierarchy` function. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to handle timezone conversion with DST-aware datetime objects, which aligns with the git diff's change of moving the `make_aware` call to include both `from_date` and `to_date`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, as it points to a different file and function than the one modified in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of timezone and DST handling but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
