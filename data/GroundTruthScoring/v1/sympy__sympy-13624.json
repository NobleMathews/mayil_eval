{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `get` method with a default value of `False` for the `contract` setting, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the default value for `contract` should be `False` as indicated in the `_default_settings` of `AbstractPythonCodePrinter`. The RESPONSE does not include the additional method `_get_statement` that was added in the git diff, but this method is not directly related to the issue of handling the `KeyError` for `contract`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, but it is not a complete match, hence the score of 9.",
