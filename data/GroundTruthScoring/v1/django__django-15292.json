    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting a review of the `technical_404_response` function and identifying how the `raising_view_name` is set. It also correctly identifies that the issue is with the formatting of the view name and suggests ensuring that `get_caller` returns the correct format. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the handling of `obj` when `obj.view_class` is present and ensuring that `caller` is set to the correct name. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify `get_caller` to return the correct view name format is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach but does not match the specific changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but it does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make within those snippets. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of providing a full solution to the issue.",
