    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'as_sum' method to include an additional parameter that controls whether the sum is evaluated or returned as an unevaluated 'Sum' object. It also suggests using this parameter to return an unevaluated 'Sum' object when requested. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also introduces an 'evaluate' parameter to control the evaluation of the sum. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details and the default behavior of the method. The git diff introduces a default value for 'n' and changes the documentation and examples to reflect the new behavior, which the RESPONSE does not mention. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces a new 'unevaluated' parameter, which is not present in the git diff and is unnecessary since the 'evaluate' parameter already serves this purpose. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
