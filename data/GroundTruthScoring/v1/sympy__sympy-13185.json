    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance or meaningful information that would assist the developer in resolving the issue. It fails to address the specific issue described, which is the strange behavior of the cse() function with MatrixSymbol indexing. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the cse_main.py file to handle instances of MatrixSymbol and MatrixElement correctly within the cse() function.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that there is no clear issue to address and requests more information, which is not helpful given that the ISSUE description already provides a detailed example of the problem. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to the code snippets as being from various parts of the SymPy library, which is not relevant to the specific issue at hand. Furthermore, the RESPONSE does not acknowledge the changes made in the git diff, which are crucial for fixing the reported behavior. The RESPONSE does not offer any insights or solutions that would aid developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff, and therefore it should receive a score of 0.",
