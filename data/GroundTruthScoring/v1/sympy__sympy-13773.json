    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the __matmul__ method to ensure that matrix multiplication only occurs between matrices. It correctly identifies that the current implementation should be replaced to prevent scalar operands from being used with the '@' operator, which aligns with the issue description.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests raising a ValueError, which is not in line with the git diff's approach of returning NotImplemented when the other operand is not a matrix or matrix-like. The git diff uses a more general approach by checking for 'is_Matrix' or 'is_MatrixLike' attributes, which allows for more flexibility and compatibility with different types of matrix-like objects, whereas the RESPONSE's use of isinstance(other, MatrixBase) is more restrictive.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the __rmatmul__ method, which is also addressed in the git diff to handle the right-hand side matrix multiplication. The RESPONSE also introduces a method _eval_matrix_mul which is not present in the git diff, and it's unclear if this method exists or is correctly implemented in the codebase.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for further review, which could be helpful for a developer, but it does not directly address the changes needed as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
