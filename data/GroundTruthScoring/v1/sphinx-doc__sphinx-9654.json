    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the inheritance structure in the code and checking the Sphinx configuration for errors, which are general troubleshooting steps but do not align with the specific solution in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the Sphinx extension code to use a new utility function `getorigbases` to safely get the `__orig_bases__` attribute from the class. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Sphinx extension or any related code, which is the core of the solution provided in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests upgrading Sphinx or reporting the issue, which are not related to the actual code changes needed. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant general advice for troubleshooting Sphinx issues, hence it is not entirely unhelpful, but it fails to address the specific changes required as per the git diff.",
