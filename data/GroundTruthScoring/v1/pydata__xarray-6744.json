    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps and considerations that are relevant to the issue of the 'center' kwarg being ignored when manually iterating over a DataArrayRolling object. It correctly identifies the need to ensure that the `__iter__` method respects the `center` parameter and suggests modifying it to yield centered windows when `center=True`. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the `__iter__` method to account for the `center` parameter by adjusting the start and stop indices of the rolling window. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that the `center` parameter is passed correctly and adding a test case, which are reasonable suggestions for debugging and verifying the fix, although these are not directly reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes shown in the git diff but offers a high-level approach that would lead to a similar outcome. The inclusion of specific code snippets to check is helpful, but the RESPONSE does not provide actionable code changes, which is why it does not score higher.",
