    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the __str__ and __repr__ methods of the AccumulationBounds class to ensure that the string representations are recreatable. The RESPONSE also correctly advises not to change the pretty printer for AccumulationBounds, which aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the pretty.py and str.py files as shown in the git diff, but it does provide the correct guidance for the AccumulationBounds class in util.py, which is the key part of the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides the correct implementation for the __str__ and __repr__ methods, which is the main focus of the issue. It also correctly advises that the pretty printer should not affect the recreatable string representations. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to the pretty.py and str.py files, but the guidance given is sufficient for the developer to implement the necessary changes in the AccumulationBounds class. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear solutions that closely align with the git diff, justifying a high score.",
