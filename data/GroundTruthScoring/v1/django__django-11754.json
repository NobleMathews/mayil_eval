{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff to receive a score of 10.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable guide that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests adding a new setting for the default `ExceptionReporter` class in the global settings, which matches the git diff. It also accurately describes the necessary changes to the `technical_500_response` function and the `AdminEmailHandler` class to use the new setting, which is in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE further includes steps for updating documentation and providing examples, which, while not directly reflected in the git diff, are relevant to the issue's request for documentation updates. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `get_exception_reporter_class` function, which is included in the git diff, but this omission does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the main goal of allowing the use of an `ExceptionReporter` subclass is addressed. Therefore, the RESPONSE receives a score of 9 for its comprehensive and accurate guidance that aligns closely with the git diff and effectively addresses the issue.",
