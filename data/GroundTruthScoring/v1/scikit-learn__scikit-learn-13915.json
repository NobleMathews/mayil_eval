    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the `astype` call to use `'int32'` instead of `'int64'` to match the system's integer size and ensuring that all other parts of the code that might be casting `indptr` to `'int64'` are also casting to `'int32'` instead on a 32-bit system. However, this advice does not align with the git diff provided, which addresses the issue by reinitializing the sparse matrix within the `_minor_reduce` function to prevent the casting error. The RESPONSE fails to mention the reinitialization strategy or any other changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `_euclidean_distances_upcast` function or the corrections in documentation and versioning. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help the developer in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
