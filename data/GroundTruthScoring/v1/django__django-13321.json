    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests clearing all existing session data, configuring various settings, verifying session backends, checking for custom session handling, ensuring compatibility with custom user models, and adding logging. However, none of these suggestions align with the git diff provided, which specifically addresses the issue by catching the BadSignature exception and returning an empty session dictionary while logging a warning. The RESPONSE does not mention handling the BadSignature exception or modifying the decode method to prevent crashes when invalid session data is encountered. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
