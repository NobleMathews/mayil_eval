    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the fixture handling code to raise an error when `@pytest.mark` is applied to a fixture, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff that introduces a warning instead of an error. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of issuing a warning, which is a less severe action than raising an error. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the warning in `doc/en/fixture.rst`, which is relevant but does not provide specific actionable guidance on how to update the documentation. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not offer additional value in addressing the issue. The RESPONSE fails to provide a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff, and it does not offer a viable alternative approach to the issue.",
