{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on updating the logic for axis label visibility and suggests a code change that aligns with the git diff's intent to fix the issue with wrapped pair plots. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to adjust the `show_axis_label` logic and suggests a condition that checks for the top row of subplots when `wrap` is specified, which is in line with the git diff's approach to handling the `wrap` parameter.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff. The git diff includes changes to the `_setup_figure` and `_setup_scales` functions, as well as a modification in the `Subplots` class constructor, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the index of the subplot against the `wrap` value, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could potentially lead the developer to look in the wrong places.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff and offers some actionable advice, but it is incomplete and includes suggestions that do not match the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4.",
