    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general troubleshooting steps for dealing with Pylint false positives, such as verifying the existence of modules, checking the `__all__` variable, and considering the use of dynamic imports. It also suggests adding the module to the `generated-members` option or using a Pylint disable comment as a last resort. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows a specific change in the Pylint codebase to address the issue. The RESPONSE does not suggest modifying Pylint's source code or provide any insight into the specific problem with the `_check_module_attrs` function in `variables.py`. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader issue of Pylint false positives, but it lacks actionable content that would lead to the specific fix shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
