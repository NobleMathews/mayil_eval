    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive guide on how to drop support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 in the Django project, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to update the `django/utils/version.py` file to remove the `PY36` and `PY37` constants and any code that uses these constants, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly advises searching the entire codebase for references to `PY36` and `PY37` and updating or removing the relevant code, which matches the git diff's approach of removing checks and special handling for these Python versions across various files.\n\nThe RESPONSE further suggests updating the documentation and the `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` file to reflect the change in supported Python versions, which is also reflected in the git diff with the update to the `setup.py` file to require Python 3.8 or higher. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises running the test suite to check for new issues and announcing the deprecation to users, which are sensible steps in the process of dropping support for older Python versions, although these steps are not directly shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses a point because it does not mention the removal of the `str()` conversions and other Python 3.6 and 3.7 specific code that the git diff shows being removed. While the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it is not exhaustive in terms of the specific code changes shown in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does achieve a similar result to the git diff by guiding the developer to remove support for Python 3.6 and 3.7 effectively.",
