    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ModelState.get_field` method to safely access the `order_with_respect_to` option by checking if it exists in `self.options` before attempting to access it, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the use of the `dict.get` method to return `None` if the `order_with_respect_to` key is not present, which is similar to the git diff's use of `self.options.get('order_with_respect_to', field_name)` to provide a default value of `field_name` if the key is not present.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests checking if `order_with_respect_to` and `field_name` are equal, which is not part of the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the core issue is addressed by ensuring that the `order_with_respect_to` key is safely accessed.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional value by linking to relevant code snippets in the Django repository that could help the developer understand the context of the issue better. This additional information is useful, although not strictly necessary for resolving the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, with a minor deviation that does not affect the effectiveness of the solution.",
