    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue may be due to the `ItalianRestaurantManyParents` model inheriting from `Place` twice and recommends removing the redundant inheritance to resolve the `AttributeError`. However, the git diff indicates that the issue is addressed by adding checks for field name clashes in diamond-shaped multi-table inheritance (MTI) models and modifying the internal helper function `_get_fields` to handle fields from parents correctly in such inheritance structures.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the issue. It does not mention any changes to the `_check_field_name_clashes` method or the `_get_fields` method, which are key elements in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on adjusting the model inheritance, which is not part of the git diff solution.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE's suggestion to check for field name clashes using Django's checks framework is somewhat relevant, it does not provide the specific changes required to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the concept of field name clashes in MTI, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
