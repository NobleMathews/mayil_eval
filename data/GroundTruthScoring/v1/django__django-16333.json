{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `UserCreationForm` not calling `save_m2m` when saving a custom user model with `ManyToManyField` fields. The proposed solution is to modify the `save` method to call `self._save_m2m()` after saving the user instance, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a call to `self.save_m2m()` in the `save` method. The RESPONSE suggests modifying a `CustomUserCreationForm`, which is a reasonable assumption given that the issue mentions a custom User model. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly references `self._save_m2m()` instead of `self.save_m2m()`, which is a minor discrepancy from the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for further reference, which is helpful but not directly related to the fix. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that achieves a similar result to the git diff, but with a slight deviation in the method name, hence a score of 7 is appropriate.",
