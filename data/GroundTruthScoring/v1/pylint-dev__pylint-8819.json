    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns well with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_order_all_first` function to ensure consistent processing of `--enable=all` and `--disable=all` options, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for handling the precedence of `--disable=all` if both options are specified, which is addressed in the git diff with an error raised in case of incompatibility. Additionally, the RESPONSE calls for updating the logic where the `enable` and `disable` lists are applied, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff to the `_config_initialization` function. The RESPONSE also suggests adding tests for verification, which is a good practice but not explicitly covered in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly reference the new `ArgumentPreprocessingError` exception introduced in the git diff, but it does imply the need for error handling when both options are specified. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not mention all the specific details of the implementation, such as the exact exception handling, which prevents it from scoring a perfect 10.",
