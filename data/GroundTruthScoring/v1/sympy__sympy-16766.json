    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue and align closely with the git diff. It suggests adding the `_print_Indexed` method to the `PythonCodePrinter` class, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that the `Indexed` class is imported if it's not already, which is a necessary step for the fix to work, although the git diff does not explicitly show this import because it may already be present in the file. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises removing or modifying any warning or exception related to `Indexed` objects, which is implied by the addition of the new method in the git diff. Finally, the RESPONSE recommends testing the changes with `lambdify`, which is a sensible step to confirm the fix, even though the git diff does not include test code. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the exact code to be added, as shown in the git diff, but the instructions are clear and would lead to a similar outcome. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its high relevance and clear guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
