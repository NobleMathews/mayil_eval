    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results. It suggests ensuring that the `subst_vars_replace` function is correctly registered to handle the `source-read` event and processes both the main document and included files. However, the git diff shows a specific implementation that patches the `StateMachine.insert_input()` method to emit the `source-read` event for included files, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking if the `docname` corresponds to an included file and applying the search and replace logic, which is not relevant to the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises debugging the `subst_vars_replace` function and reviewing the Sphinx changelog for changes, which are generic troubleshooting steps and do not align with the specific solution provided in the git diff.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to various code snippets in the Sphinx repository that are not directly related to the issue or the git diff's solution. These links do not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff and the issue at hand.",
