{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely matches the git diff. It suggests modifying the `strip_accents_unicode` function to handle NFKD normalized strings correctly, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use a generator expression instead of a list comprehension, which aligns with the git diff's approach to avoid creating an intermediate list. Additionally, the RESPONSE correctly mentions the use of `unicodedata.combining` to check for combining characters, which is also present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is almost identical to the git diff, with the exception of the comments and the exact placement of the code. The RESPONSE's code snippet correctly adds a try-except block to handle the case where the string is not ASCII-compatible, and then normalizes and strips accents from the string if needed. This is the same logic as in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code sections in the repository, which is helpful for context but not directly related to the git diff. The RESPONSE does not include the comments from the git diff, which provide additional explanation, but this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff and effectively addresses the issue described. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate.",
