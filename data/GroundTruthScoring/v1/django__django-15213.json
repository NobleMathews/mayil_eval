    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `NegatedExpression` class and its `as_sql` method, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of incorrect SQL generation. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a modification to the `select_format` method in the `Field` class, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE focuses on the `NegatedExpression` and `ExpressionWrapper` classes without providing a clear solution. The RESPONSE does not offer a direct solution to the problem of an empty string in the SQL 'SELECT' clause, which is the core issue described in the original problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
