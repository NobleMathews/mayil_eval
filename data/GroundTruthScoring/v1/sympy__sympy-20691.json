    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `is_constant` method to handle `MatrixSymbol` instances correctly and adding a test case for the inverse of a `MatrixSymbol`. However, the git diff provided does not show any changes to the `is_constant` method or the addition of a test case. Instead, the git diff includes changes to various files, such as `expr.py`, `kind.py`, `power.py`, `exponential.py`, `determinant.py`, `matexpr.py`, and `matrices.py`, which involve handling kinds and ensuring proper behavior of matrix expressions and operations.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the changes shown in the git diff. It does not address the modifications made to the kind handling or the specific changes to matrix-related classes and methods. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses handling `MatrixSymbol` and inversion, which are related to the issue at hand, but it fails to provide actionable steps that reflect the actual changes needed as per the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff or effectively addresses the issue described.",
