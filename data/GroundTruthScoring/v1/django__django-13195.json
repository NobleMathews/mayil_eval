    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `delete_cookie` method to include parameters for `secure` and `httponly`, and to set the default value of `secure` to `True` if `samesite` is `'None'`. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of setting the `SameSite` attribute correctly, it does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `delete_cookie` method has been updated to include a `samesite` parameter and to conditionally set the `secure` flag based on the `samesite` value and the cookie name. The RESPONSE's suggestion to set `secure` to `True` by default if `samesite` is `'None'` is not reflected in the git diff, which uses a more nuanced approach to determine the `secure` flag. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention updating the `_update_cookie` method in `cookie.py` and the `process_response` method in `middleware.py`, both of which are included in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the core issue of handling the `SameSite` attribute, but it lacks alignment with the git diff's approach and is incomplete, missing key changes shown in the git diff.",
