{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to deprecate the `CryptPasswordHasher` in Django 4.1 and remove it in Django 5.0, which is exactly what the issue describes. The RESPONSE's Step 1 matches the git diff by suggesting the addition of a deprecation warning in the `__init__` method of the `CryptPasswordHasher` class, including the exact warning message and the use of `RemovedInDjango50Warning`. The RESPONSE also correctly advises on the removal of the class in Django 5.0, updating the documentation, updating the test suite, and communicating the change, which are all relevant to the deprecation process but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not include the comment `# RemovedInDjango50Warning.` as seen in the git diff, which is a minor omission and does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate as the RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and closely aligns with the git diff.",
