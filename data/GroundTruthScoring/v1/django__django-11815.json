    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `default` parameter in the `Item` model's `CharField` to use the `name` attribute of the `Status` Enum member and updating the migration file accordingly. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which changes the `EnumSerializer` to serialize the Enum using its name rather than its value. However, the RESPONSE does not address the actual change in the serializer code, which is the core of the issue. Instead, it suggests a manual change in the model and migration file, which is not a scalable or maintainable solution compared to the git diff's approach of fixing the serialization process itself. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it does aim to use the Enum name instead of its value, but it fails to provide a complete solution that would prevent the issue from occurring in future migrations. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to code snippets to check, which is not directly actionable and does not contribute to resolving the issue at hand.",
