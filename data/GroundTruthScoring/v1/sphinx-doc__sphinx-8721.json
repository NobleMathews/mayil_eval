    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `sphinx.ext.viewcode` extension to check the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration value before generating module pages for EPUB. This aligns with the git diff's approach to prevent the creation of module pages for certain builder names when the configuration is set to `False`. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `doctree_read` function, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff instead adds a conditional check directly in the `collect_pages` function to handle the `singlehtml` and `epub` builder names. The RESPONSE does not mention the `singlehtml` builder name and does not match the exact location of the change in the code as per the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to ensure that the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration value is properly initialized, which is not part of the git diff but is a reasonable step to ensure the configuration is respected. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not fully align with the git diff.",
