    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to Sphinx's C++ domain parsing of template parameter packs with parentheses. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `flat_any` template alias to avoid using parentheses, which is not a solution to the actual problem of Sphinx's parsing capabilities. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the Sphinx C++ domain parser without providing any specific guidance or actionable steps, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows extensive modifications to the `cpp.py` file to handle various cases of expressions and template argument lists, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets and does not offer any insights or actionable guidance that would help developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful or misguided and offers no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
