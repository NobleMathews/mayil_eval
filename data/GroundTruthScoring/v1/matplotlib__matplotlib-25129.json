    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying compatibility with the `qtagg` backend, checking the `useblit` parameter, ensuring the `update` method is functioning correctly, confirming the validity of overridden methods, and reporting the issue to the Matplotlib development team if necessary. However, the git diff indicates that the actual changes required to fix the issue involve importing `MouseEvent` and simulating mouse move events in several example files, as well as renaming event handler methods and removing deprecated code in 'lib/matplotlib/widgets.py'. The RESPONSE does not align with these specific changes and does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the resolution of the issue as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the general area of the problem (the `AnnotatedCursor` example), but it fails to identify the correct solution or provide actionable steps that would resolve the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
