    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, offering a modification to the _print_MatAdd function that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests handling the negation of the item and inserting the correct operator between terms, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE includes additional changes not present in the git diff, such as replacing a space with ' - ' and printing '-item' instead of 'item'. These changes are not necessary according to the git diff but do not fundamentally alter the effectiveness of the solution. The RESPONSE also provides a detailed explanation and context, which is helpful for understanding the changes.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with pretty printing of `MatAdd` objects and provides a solution that involves modifying the `_print_MatAdd` function to handle negative coefficients correctly. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use `item.as_coeff_mmul()[0]` and `_coeff_isneg(coeff)` is in line with the git diff's approach. However, the RESPONSE adds extra steps such as negating the item and changing the string used for concatenation, which are not present in the git diff. Despite these differences, the RESPONSE's solution would still effectively resolve the issue, as it ensures that the `+` operator is correctly added and negative terms are properly handled. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
