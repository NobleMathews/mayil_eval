{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a method to calculate the mean average precision (mAP) for multi-class classification, which is relevant to the issue of adding mAP as a feature. It includes code snippets and a step-by-step guide on how to implement the feature, which is actionable and useful.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows modifications to the `average_precision_score` function in the `sklearn.metrics._ranking` module to support multi-class classification directly within the function, rather than creating a separate function for mAP as suggested in the RESPONSE. The git diff also includes changes to error handling and support for the multiclass case, which the RESPONSE does not address.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the restriction note in the documentation, which is part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `label_binarize` and calculating mAP for each class separately, which is a valid approach but differs from the git diff's approach of integrating multiclass support directly into the `average_precision_score` function.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
