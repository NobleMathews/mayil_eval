    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of raising an error when `update()` or `delete()` operations are called on a QuerySet resulting from `union()`, `intersection()`, or `difference()`. The proposed solution involves adding checks in the `update` and `delete` methods of the `QuerySet` class to raise a `TypeError` if the `query` has a `combinator` attribute, indicating that a combination operation has been performed. This approach is highly relevant and aligns closely with the git diff, which also adds a call to `self._not_support_combined_queries('update')` and `self._not_support_combined_queries('delete')` in the respective methods to prevent such operations after combined queries. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the `_not_support_combined_queries` method, but the essence of the solution is the same: to prevent `update` and `delete` operations after combined queries and raise an appropriate error. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by suggesting to ensure that the `combinator` attribute is set when combination methods are called, which is a valid and necessary part of the solution. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation but offers a viable alternative that achieves the same result, hence the score of 8.",
