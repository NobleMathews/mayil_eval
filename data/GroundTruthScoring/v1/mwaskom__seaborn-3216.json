    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff, nor does it offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reverting a change in `_core/subplots.py` from `figure = target` back to `figure = target.figure`, which is not related to the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in `_compat.py` and `_core/plot.py` to handle layout engines differently, which is the correct approach to address the issue of the figure title being removed. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that `fig.suptitle(\"Test title\")` is called at the correct time, which is not relevant to the issue described, as the problem lies with the layout engine handling, not the order of method calls. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of the figure title being removed when using subfigures with the seaborn objects API, and it does not provide any useful guidance that would help in resolving the issue. Therefore, it does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
