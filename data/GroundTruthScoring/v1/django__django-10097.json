    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue described. It suggests updating the regular expression in `URLValidator` to enforce RFC 1738 section 3.1, which is precisely what the git diff does by modifying the regex pattern to disallow unencoded \":\", \"@\", and \"/\" in the username and password components of a URL. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the query string should not be affected by this validation, aligning with the git diff's preservation of the query string's current validation behavior. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding test cases for URLs like `http://foo/bar@example.com` to ensure they fail validation, which is an implicit part of the testing process when modifying validation patterns, although the git diff does not explicitly mention this. The RESPONSE also advises reviewing the pull request mentioned in the issue, which is a prudent step but not directly related to the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's regex pattern, but it achieves the same result by disallowing the specified characters unless they are percent-encoded. The RESPONSE is not a perfect 10 because it does not provide the exact regex pattern found in the git diff, but it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively.",
