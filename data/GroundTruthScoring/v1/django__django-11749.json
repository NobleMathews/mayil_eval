{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of `call_command` not handling mutually exclusive groups correctly when arguments are passed as keyword arguments. It suggests adding logic to the `call_command` function to handle required mutually exclusive argument groups, which is aligned with the git diff's approach to modifying the `call_command` function. However, the RESPONSE proposes raising a `CommandError` directly if no required mutually exclusive arguments are provided, which differs from the git diff's approach of modifying the list comprehension that builds `parse_args`. The git diff adds a new variable `mutually_exclusive_required_options` and adjusts the condition in the list comprehension to include options that are part of a required mutually exclusive group. The RESPONSE's approach is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not provide the same level of detail in modifying the existing code structure. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets, which are not actionable within the context of the git diff and do not contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a somewhat different solution, which warrants a score within the 4-6 range.",
