    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to check the 'sympy/core/symbol.py' file for changes between versions 1.6.2 and 1.7, which is a reasonable step when investigating the issue. It also correctly identifies that the issue may be related to modifications in the '__slots__' attribute in the 'Symbol' class or its parent classes. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the solution provided in the GIT DIFF, which involves adding '__slots__ = ()' to the 'Printable' class in the '_print_helpers.py' file to ensure that instances of subclasses using slots will not need to have a '__dict__'. The RESPONSE's suggestion to reintroduce '__slots__' or update the code to work with the new class structure is somewhat aligned with the GIT DIFF but does not pinpoint the exact file or class where the change should be made. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in terms of providing a direct solution to the issue described.",
