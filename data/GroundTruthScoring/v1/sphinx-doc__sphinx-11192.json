    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating the parallel build mechanism and reviewing specific files for potential issues with search index generation. It also recommends ensuring thread safety and checking for recent changes related to parallel processing or search index generation. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of a smaller search index when using parallel builds, they do not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the `sphinx/builders/html/__init__.py` file, where the `index_page` method call is moved from the `write_doc` method to the `write_doc_serialized` method. The RESPONSE does not mention this change or provide a similar solution. Instead, it offers a general investigation approach without specific actionable steps that would lead to the resolution of the issue. The RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue, and therefore, it receives a low score.",
