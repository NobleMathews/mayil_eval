    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `nthroot_mod` function to include `0` in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`, which aligns with the git diff that adds a check for `a % p == 0` and returns `[0]` as a root. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the current implementation does not consider other possible roots when `a % p == 0` and suggests updating the condition to append `0` to the list of roots instead of returning it directly. This is in line with the git diff, which adds a new function `_nthroot_mod_composite` to handle cases when `p` is not prime and includes the condition for `a % p == 0` to return `[0]` as one of the roots. The RESPONSE also correctly notes the importance of the `all_roots` parameter in the function signature and its handling throughout the function calls. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the new function `_nthroot_mod_composite` and the use of the `crt` and `cartes` functions, which are part of the git diff's solution to handle composite modulus. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match to the git diff but still provides a highly relevant and actionable solution that would significantly aid in resolving the issue.",
