{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the handling of variable-length arrays (VLAs) in the FITSDiff class and suggests checking the comparison logic in the TableDataDiff class, which is relevant to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the issue may be related to the precision or tolerance values and recommends using np.allclose with the specified rtol and atol for comparison, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using where_not_allclose for floating-point comparisons.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not specifically mention the addition of the 'Q' format check alongside the 'P' format, which is a key part of the git diff. Instead, it provides a more general suggestion to check the comparison logic for columns with format specifiers 'P' or 'Q'. While this is on the right track, it lacks the specificity of the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a detailed explanation and additional steps for debugging and testing, which are helpful for addressing the issue but are not directly related to the specific change in the git diff. The inclusion of links to code snippets is useful for locating the relevant sections of code but does not directly contribute to solving the issue as per the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides relevant and actionable advice that aligns with the git diff's approach but does not match it in specificity regarding the 'Q' format check. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
