{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to modify the `bulk_update` method to return the number of rows updated, which is the issue at hand. It aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the initialization of a `rows_updated` variable and incrementing it with the number of rows updated after each batch, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests returning the `rows_updated` variable at the end of the method. The RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is consistent with the git diff, and it also advises adding tests to verify the new behavior, which is a good practice but not shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the initial return value change from `return` to `return 0` when no objects are provided, but this is a minor detail and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
