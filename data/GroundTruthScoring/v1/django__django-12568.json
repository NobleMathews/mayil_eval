{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue of Django's humanize intword filter not accepting negative numbers. It suggests using the absolute value of the number for the conversion logic while preserving the original sign for the final output, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that reflects the changes suggested in the git diff, such as introducing the `abs_value` variable and using it in the conditional checks and conversion logic. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating test cases to include negative numbers, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that the RESPONSE includes a formatted string output with a negative sign prefix, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, as it still effectively addresses the issue and provides a viable solution.",
