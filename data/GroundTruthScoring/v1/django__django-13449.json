{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the use of `DecimalField` in conjunction with the `LAG` function and the `OVER` clause in SQLite, which is causing the crash. The solution provided involves modifying the `as_sqlite` method in the `Window` class to cast the `DecimalField` to a `FloatField` before the window function is applied, which is exactly what the git diff suggests. The RESPONSE also correctly advises setting the `output_field` of the `Lag` function to `FloatField` to avoid the error, which aligns with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes code snippets that are directly relevant to the issue and the proposed solution. It also provides a link to the relevant sections of the codebase, which could be helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it includes additional information about checking code snippets and links to the codebase, which, while potentially useful, are not part of the git diff. The git diff focuses solely on the changes to the code, not on providing external references or additional context. However, this additional information does not detract from the accuracy and relevance of the RESPONSE's solution, which is why it receives a high score.",
