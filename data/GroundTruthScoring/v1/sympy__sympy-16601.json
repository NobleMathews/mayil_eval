    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests avoiding the use of the `sign` function with symbolic arguments and proposes a change to the `p_parameter` property to return a symbolic expression for `p`. However, this does not align with the git diff, which actually introduces the use of the `sign` function to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE also suggests using `Abs(p) * self.focal_length` to ensure `p` is non-negative, which is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly address the TypeError issue described in the ISSUE, and it does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach of using the `sign` function to determine the value of `p`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the TypeError but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
