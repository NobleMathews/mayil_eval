    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to troubleshooting the issue with the 'hist' function in Matplotlib, suggesting to review the commit that may have introduced the bug, verify the correct passing of parameters, and test the function to ensure the expected behavior. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the '_axes.py' file where the 'density' parameter should be set in the 'hist_kwargs' dictionary, but the RESPONSE does not mention this change or provide a similar solution. Instead, it offers a broad set of steps to investigate the issue, which, while somewhat relevant, do not offer the clear, actionable steps present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests considering explicitly setting the 'bins' parameter, which is not related to the actual fix needed as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to directly address the issue as shown in the git diff.",
