    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to handle `discrete_features` when it is not 'auto' and suggests adding test cases for different types of `discrete_features`. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the type checking or conversion of `discrete_features` before the comparison, which is in line with the git diff that includes a check for `discrete_features` being a string and uses `check_array` to ensure it is a boolean array if not.\n\nThe RESPONSE further advises using `isinstance(discrete_features, str)` to check if `discrete_features` is a string before comparing it to 'auto', which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the suggestion to ensure that the function can handle `discrete_features` being a boolean array without raising a FutureWarning or error due to numpy version changes, which is a relevant concern given the issue description.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 is that it does not explicitly mention raising a ValueError if the string is invalid, which is a detail included in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
