    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'plt.eventplot' function to accept an array-like 'alpha' parameter and to update the 'set_alpha' method or the part of the code that calls 'set_alpha'. It also mentions ensuring the length of the 'alpha' parameter matches the length of the 'data' parameter and testing the updated function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed instructions on how to implement the suggested modifications. It also does not align with the git diff, which shows the actual changes made to the 'eventplot' function in the '_axes.py' and 'pyplot.py' files to support a list of alpha values. The git diff includes adding an 'alpha' parameter to the function signature, handling the 'alpha' parameter similarly to other parameters like 'colors' and 'linestyles', and updating the logic to apply the alpha values to the respective lines or collections.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention any of the specific changes shown in the git diff, such as the addition of the 'alpha' parameter in the function signature or the handling of iterable alpha values. It also incorrectly refers to updating the 'set_alpha' method, which is not part of the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a link to code snippets that might be related to the handling of alpha values, but these are not directly related to the changes required to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would help a developer implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
