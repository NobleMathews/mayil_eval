    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using `functools.update_wrapper` or `functools.wraps` to maintain the original function signature and to ensure that the wrapper function created by the `sensitive_variables` decorator has the same signature as the original function. This is somewhat relevant to the issue of preserving the function signature but does not align with the git diff, which replaces `inspect.getcallargs` with `inspect.signature` and `signature.bind` to check for argument compatibility without altering the function signature or its wrapper.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking the `sensitive_variables` decorator implementation and the `authenticate` method's decoration, which is relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide specific guidance on how to modify the code to fix the issue, unlike the git diff which shows the exact changes needed in the code.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a suggestion to review the changelog or commit history for changes related to the `sensitive_variables` decorator and the `authenticate` method, which could be helpful for understanding the context of the issue but does not directly help in resolving the current problem.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that the error handling logic within the `authenticate` method is robust, which is not directly related to the issue of preserving the function signature and does not align with the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant suggestions but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not address the specific changes shown in the git diff, such as replacing `inspect.getcallargs` with `inspect.signature` and `signature.bind`. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
