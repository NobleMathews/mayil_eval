    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests surrounding the problematic code with a try/except block to catch UnicodeError, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also recommends an appropriate error handling mechanism, such as logging the error and/or providing a fallback mechanism. This is a reasonable suggestion for handling exceptions, although the git diff specifically raises a custom `InvalidURL` exception instead. The RESPONSE further advises locating the code in `requests/models.py`, which is correct as per the git diff. The inclusion of code snippets and links to the repository is beyond the scope of the git diff but offers additional value by guiding the developer to potential relevant sections of the codebase. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific exception handling (raising a custom exception), but it achieves a similar result by ensuring that the UnicodeError is caught and handled appropriately. Therefore, it receives a high score for its relevance and utility in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
