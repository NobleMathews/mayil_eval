    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting changes to the ForeignKey declaration in the Content model, the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py, and the name attribute in the DJ_RegLoginConfig class. These changes are relevant to the issue of makemigrations crashing due to a lazy reference to a ForeignKey with a mixed-case app name. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves modifying the deconstruct method in the related.py file to handle the case where the app label is in mixed case. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the ForeignKey declaration and ensure the app name matches in settings.py and apps.py is a valid alternative approach to the problem, but it does not address the underlying issue in the Django framework's code that the git diff aims to fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the issue.",
