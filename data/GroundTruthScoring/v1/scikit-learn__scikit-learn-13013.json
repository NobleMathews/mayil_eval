    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to address the issue of replacing manual checks for fitting with the use of the `check_is_fitted` method. It aligns perfectly with the git diff, which shows the replacement of manual attribute checks with `check_is_fitted` calls and the removal of `NotFittedError` imports where they are no longer needed due to the use of `check_is_fitted`. The RESPONSE also mentions ensuring that the error message for `NotFittedError` is consistent, which is reflected in the git diff where the error message is standardized. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises removing redundant error handling code, which is seen in the git diff where manual error-raising code is removed. The RESPONSE is comprehensive, providing clear instructions that would enable a developer to fix the issue effectively, and it includes a reference to code snippets that are directly related to the issue.",
