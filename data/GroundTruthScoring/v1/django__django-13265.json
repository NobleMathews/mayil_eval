    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to move the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before the `AddIndex` operation involving the `_order` field to prevent the error described in the issue. The RESPONSE also emphasizes the importance of setting the correct dependencies for the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. The provided code snippet correctly demonstrates the new order of operations, which matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of code changes but offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result, which should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly advises the developer to reorder the migration operations, which is the key change made in the git diff. It also provides a code snippet that demonstrates the correct order of operations, which is consistent with the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE's emphasis on setting the correct dependencies aligns with the git diff's addition of dependencies for the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation. The RESPONSE does not include the exact code changes from the git diff but provides an effective alternative solution that would resolve the issue. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
