    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_show_fixture_action` function to use `repr` instead of `str` to avoid `BytesWarning`. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also aims to fix the `BytesWarning` issue by using `saferepr` instead of the implicit `str` conversion. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the use of `saferepr` from `_pytest._io.saferepr`, which is specifically imported and used in the git diff to handle the representation of `fixturedef.cached_param`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests a conditional check for bytes objects, which is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the same issue but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant information about checking code snippets in various unrelated directories, which does not contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2.",
