{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue of the infinite loop in ExceptionReporter.get_traceback_frames() by suggesting modifications to the '_get_explicit_or_implicit_cause' method and the 'get_traceback_frames' method to check for cycles in the exception causes. The RESPONSE's approach of maintaining a set of visited exceptions to prevent reprocessing the same exception is a valid alternative to the git diff's solution, which also aims to prevent an infinite loop by breaking out of the loop if a cyclic reference is detected. The RESPONSE's solution is effective and relevant, and it aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a warning to notify about the cycle detection, which is not present in the git diff but adds value to the solution. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, which does not introduce a new method or warning. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is still a valid and effective way to resolve the issue.",
