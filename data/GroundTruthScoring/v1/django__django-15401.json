    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear explanation of the intended behavior, which is to prevent unsaved objects from being used in related filters, aligning with the issue's description. It also correctly identifies that there is no specific documentation on this behavior and suggests that the Django documentation assumes objects in queries are saved. However, the RESPONSE proposes a different solution by suggesting a code change in a different file (`django/db/models/sql/query.py`) and method (`check_related_objects`) than the one addressed in the git diff (`django/db/models/fields/related_lookups.py` and the `get_normalized_value` function). While the RESPONSE's proposed solution could be a valid alternative approach to the problem, it does not match the git diff's approach of adding a deprecation warning. The RESPONSE's solution is more immediate and does not provide a deprecation path, which is a significant deviation from the git diff's solution that includes a deprecation warning (`RemovedInDjango50Warning`). Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is scored accordingly.",
