    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of generic troubleshooting steps for handling Greek letters in the `sympify` function, but it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the actual changes made to resolve the issue involve modifying the `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser` module, specifically by removing the custom tokenize implementation and using Python's built-in `tokenize` module instead, as well as adjusting the `factorial_notation` and adding `repeated_decimals` handling in the parser. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific changes or the relevant modules and functions that were actually modified according to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
