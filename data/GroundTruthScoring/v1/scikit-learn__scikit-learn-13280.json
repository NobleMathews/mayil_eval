    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests enabling Laplace smoothing by setting `alpha` to a value greater than zero and modifying the `_update_class_log_prior` method to handle zero counts. It also suggests updating class counts with smoothing in the `partial_fit` method and setting a default value for `alpha`. While these suggestions are relevant to the issue of handling unobserved targets, they do not align with the git diff provided.\n\nThe git diff shows that the solution implemented involves catching and ignoring a `RuntimeWarning` when a zero count is encountered, and then adjusting the computation of `self.class_log_prior_` to use the log of the class counts. The RESPONSE does not mention catching warnings or the specific changes made in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on adding smoothing to the class counts, which is a different approach to the problem.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for understanding the context but does not offer direct actionable changes that align with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
