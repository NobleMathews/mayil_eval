    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `dtype` parameter is set correctly when initializing the `OneHotEncoder` and that the sparse matrix is created with the correct `dtype`. It also provides a code snippet that should be modified to use `self.dtype`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows that the problem was not with the initialization of the `OneHotEncoder` or the creation of the sparse matrix itself, but rather with the `_transform_selected` function, which needed an additional `dtype` parameter and a modification to cast the non-transformed parts of `X` to the desired `dtype` before concatenation. The RESPONSE fails to identify the core issue of casting non-transformed columns to the correct `dtype` and does not mention modifying the `_transform_selected` function. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the `dtype` concern, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's solution and does not provide a viable alternative approach.",
