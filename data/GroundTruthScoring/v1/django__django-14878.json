    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed approach to address the issue with Django's `inspectdb` command not properly detecting primary keys and certain datatypes in SQLite3 databases. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `get_primary_key_column` method to use the `PRAGMA table_info` SQL statement for detecting primary keys, whereas the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_field_type` method and updating the `data_types_reverse` mapping for handling `DOUBLE` and `UNSIGNED INTEGER` data types, which is not directly related to the primary key detection issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the change in the approach to detecting primary keys, which is the core of the git diff. Instead, it focuses on datatype detection, which is a separate part of the issue described but not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses part of the issue described in the original issue (datatype detection), but it fails to provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff for the primary key detection problem.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it offers some relevant information regarding datatype detection but does not provide a solution for the primary key detection issue, which is the main focus of the git diff.",
