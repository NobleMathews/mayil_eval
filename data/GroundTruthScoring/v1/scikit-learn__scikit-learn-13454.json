    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the error message in the OrdinalEncoder when a single list of categories is passed. It provides a solution by suggesting the correct usage of the OrdinalEncoder with a custom list of categories, which is to use a list containing a single list of categories for the one feature in `X`. This aligns with the git diff, which corrects the error message to refer to `categories` instead of `n_values`. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to the relevant code snippets in the sklearn repository, which could help the developer understand where the changes need to be made. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the change in the error message text as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
