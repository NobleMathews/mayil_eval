    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `deconstruct` method in the `FileField` class to ensure that the `storage` argument is consistently included when a callable is provided. The RESPONSE's proposed code change is almost identical to the git diff, with the addition of an `elif` clause to handle the case where `_storage_callable` is set but is equal to `default_storage`. This additional clause is not present in the git diff, but it does not conflict with the git diff's solution and could be considered a more explicit handling of the callable case. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use `getattr` to check for `_storage_callable` and to assign `storage` before the conditional check, which is in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE loses one point because it includes an unnecessary check (`elif hasattr(self, '_storage_callable')`) that is not present in the git diff and is not required to solve the issue described. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
