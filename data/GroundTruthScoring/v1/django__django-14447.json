    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution that closely aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. It offers clear, actionable instructions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_cull` method to accept an additional parameter `count`, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the `num` parameter to the `_cull` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the call to `self._cull` to pass the `num` variable, which matches the git diff's change to pass `num` instead of just `now`.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to suggest implementing a `CULL_EVERY_X` setting, which is not part of the git diff but is relevant to the issue's discussion about not running the culling code every time. This suggestion is a valid alternative approach to the issue and could be considered an enhancement beyond the git diff's scope.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides code snippets that are actionable and relevant, including the modification of the `_cull` method and the update to the call to `self._cull`. However, it does not include the changes to the `_cull` method that adjust the calculation of `remaining_num` and `cull_num` based on the `deleted_count`, which are present in the git diff. This omission is why the score is not a perfect 10.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, achieving similar results, which is why it receives a high score.",
