    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests converting the `alphas` parameter to a list of floats or using a numpy array with a float data type to avoid the `ValueError` when using `RidgeCV` with Python 3.6. This aligns well with the git diff, which includes a change to ensure that `alphas` is converted to a numpy array with `self.alphas = np.asarray(alphas)` and that each alpha is cast to a float during the loop with `float(alpha)`. The RESPONSE does not include the additional validation check for negative values in `alphas` that is present in the git diff, but it does address the core issue of integer powers not being allowed. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for understanding the context of the issue and the solution. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the validation check, but it does offer a viable alternative to the git diff by ensuring that `alphas` are treated as floats, which would prevent the error from occurring.",
