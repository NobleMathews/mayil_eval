    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue. The git diff suggests modifying the Django source code to set the '_iterable_class' to 'ValuesIterable' when a 'values_select' is present in the query. This change directly addresses the issue of the queryset not returning the expected list of dictionaries after being unpickled.\n\nThe RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests ensuring that the queryset is not evaluated before pickling and modifying the pickling and unpickling process to preserve the type of the queryset. While the RESPONSE does touch on the pickling process, which is relevant to the issue, it does not provide a concrete solution to the underlying problem of the queryset's behavior after being unpickled. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests re-applying 'values()' and 'annotate()' after unpickling, which is not necessary and does not reflect the changes in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the solution and do not provide actionable steps for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific change needed in the Django source code and does not offer an effective alternative approach. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
