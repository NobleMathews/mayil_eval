{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code example for adding a `fontfamily` parameter to the `tick_params` function, which is in line with the issue's request to add a fontfamily/labelfont kwarg to `tick_params`. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the function signature and updating the implementation to handle the new argument, which is consistent with the git diff that shows changes to the `tick_params` function and related methods to support the new `labelfontfamily` parameter.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to update the `tick_params` function, which is similar to the changes shown in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the specific changes to the `axis.py` file, which are also part of the solution. Instead, it provides a general approach to the problem, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.\n\nThe RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, providing clear guidance on how to implement the requested feature. It aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue, although it does not include all the specific changes. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
