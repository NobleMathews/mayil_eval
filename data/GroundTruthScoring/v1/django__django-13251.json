    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests renaming the `negate` field or using a different syntax when calling the `filter` method, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the `django/db/models/query.py` file, specifically modifying the `_filter_or_exclude` and related methods to handle the `negate` parameter correctly. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes needed in the Django ORM methods and instead provides a workaround that does not solve the underlying issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
