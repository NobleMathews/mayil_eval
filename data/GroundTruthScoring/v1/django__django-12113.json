    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the use of persistent SQLite databases during testing and suggests that the 'database is locked' error may be due to concurrent access. It offers general advice on ensuring that each test database is accessed by only one thread/process at a time and suggests disabling parallel execution or using a different database backend. However, the RESPONSE does not provide any specific code changes or directly address the changes shown in the git diff, which involves modifying the 'test_db_signature' method to include the 'test_database_name' when the database is not in memory. The RESPONSE also suggests checking code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff provided. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in discussing the issue of database locking, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not offer a solution that would resolve the specific problem described in the issue. Therefore, it scores a 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
