    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution that addresses the issue of the `flask run` command not accepting the `--key` and `--cert` arguments in reverse order. It suggests modifying the `_validate_key` function to ensure that the `cert` parameter is correctly retrieved, which aligns with the git diff's approach of making the `--cert` option eager to ensure it is processed before the `--key` option. The RESPONSE also includes an update to the `run_command` function to handle the `cert` parameter as a tuple when both `--cert` and `--key` are provided, which is a relevant and necessary change to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the `is_eager=True` flag for the `--cert` option, but it achieves a similar result by ensuring the correct order of processing for the `--cert` and `--key` options. The RESPONSE is actionable and provides code snippets and explanations that would help the developer implement the solution. Therefore, it scores an 8 for being highly relevant and offering clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
