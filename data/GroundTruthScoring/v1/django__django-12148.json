    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `get_absolute_url` method in the `FlatPage` model to use `reverse` correctly, which aligns with the git diff's approach to use `reverse` for URL resolution. However, the RESPONSE does not include the necessary error handling for `NoReverseMatch` exceptions, nor does it iterate over possible URL patterns as the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not import `NoReverseMatch` or the `flatpage` view, which are both present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the namespace and view name in `urls.py`, which is a valid point but not directly addressed in the git diff. Lastly, the RESPONSE mentions overriding the `get_absolute_url` method in the `FlatPageAdmin` class if necessary, which is not part of the git diff and may not be relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially aligns with the git diff.",
