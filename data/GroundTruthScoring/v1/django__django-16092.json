    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of steps to implement a feature for defining database defaults in Django, including modifications to the `Field` class and the `column_sql` method. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which contains specific changes to multiple files within the Django framework to support the `db_default` feature. The RESPONSE suggests a simplified example that does not reflect the complexity or the actual changes made in the git diff, such as handling expressions and callable defaults, supporting different database backends, and updating the schema methods for adding and altering fields. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section titled \"Code snippets to check\" with links to a repository, which is not relevant to the task of fixing the issue described. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in implementing the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
