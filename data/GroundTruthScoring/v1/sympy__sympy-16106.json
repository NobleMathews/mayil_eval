    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method `_print_Indexed` to handle the printing of `Indexed` objects, which is in line with the git diff that introduces a `_print_Indexed` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `_print_Basic` method to handle instances of `Indexed`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff but is a reasonable step to ensure that the new method is utilized correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE's example implementation for `_print_Indexed` is slightly different from the git diff but achieves the same goal of correctly printing `Indexed` objects in MathML. The RESPONSE uses an `mrow` element with an `msub` child, while the git diff uses an `msub` element directly and handles the case of single and multiple indices differently. However, this difference does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as it still provides a viable alternative to the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the `_print_IndexedBase` method or the `_print_tuple` method, which are included in the git diff. While these methods are not directly related to the issue of printing `Indexed` objects, they are part of the overall improvement to the MathML printer in the git diff. The absence of these methods in the RESPONSE is why it does not receive a perfect score.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable and relevant guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue, closely matching the git diff's approach.",
