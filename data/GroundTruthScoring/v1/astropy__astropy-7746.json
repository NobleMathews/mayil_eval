    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `wcs_pix2world` method to handle empty input lists and return empty lists without calling the C library functions if the inputs are empty. This aligns with the git diff's approach of handling empty arrays before proceeding with the transformation functions. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific location and manner in which the checks for empty arrays are implemented. The git diff adds checks within the `_return_list_of_arrays` and `_return_single_array` helper functions, while the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `wcs_pix2world` method directly. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the necessary changes to handle the case where the shape of the array is zero, which is addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of handling empty lists/arrays but does not provide a complete solution that matches the git diff's approach.",
