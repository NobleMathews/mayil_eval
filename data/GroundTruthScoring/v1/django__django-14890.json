    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests raising a NotImplementedError when the '&' or '|' operators are used after QuerySet operations like union, intersection, or difference. This is partially aligned with the git diff, which adds a check to raise a TypeError instead of NotImplementedError. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to add checks in the __and__ and __or__ methods but suggests using hasattr and checking for specific strings, which is different from the git diff's approach of adding a new method _check_operator_queryset to handle the check.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a detailed explanation and code snippets, which are helpful for understanding where the changes should be made. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's implementation of raising a TypeError and the specific method used to perform the check. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of matching the exact solution provided by the git diff.",
