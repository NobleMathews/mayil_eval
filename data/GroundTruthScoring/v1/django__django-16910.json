    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying various parts of the Django codebase to address the issue with `only()` not limiting the fields retrieved when used with `select_related()`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff specifically modifies the `_get_only_select_mask` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to handle reverse OneToOneField relations correctly, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests checking different methods and parts of the code, such as `get_related_selections`, `get_default_columns`, and the `only()` method implementation, which are not directly related to the fix provided in the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify that there is an issue with the handling of fields in the SQL query construction, but it fails to pinpoint the exact location and nature of the fix required. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests opening a ticket with the Django project, which is not necessary since the git diff already provides a solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general area of the problem but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
