    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `cross_val_predict` function to handle `MultiOutputClassifier` instances when `method='predict_proba'` is used, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff adds a `fit` method to the `MultiOutputClassifier` class that sets the `classes_` attribute, which is the direct cause of the AttributeError mentioned in the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the root cause of the issue, which is the absence of the `classes_` attribute in the `MultiOutputClassifier` object. Instead, it suggests a workaround by modifying the `cross_val_predict` function, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach of fixing the class itself. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any code changes or specific guidance on how to implement the suggested changes, making it less actionable. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the need to handle `MultiOutputClassifier` instances differently but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
