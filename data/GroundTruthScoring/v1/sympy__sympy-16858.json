    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding parameter checks in the `__init__` methods of distribution classes and ensuring that the `check` static method is called within the `__init__` method to validate parameters. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the `__init__` methods, nor does it suggest that the `check` methods should be called from `__init__`. Instead, the git diff adds `set` methods and `check` static methods directly to the distribution classes, and in some cases, modifies existing methods to ensure proper parameter validation and correct distribution properties.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of directly modifying the distribution classes and their methods. It also does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution, as it suggests a different implementation strategy that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
