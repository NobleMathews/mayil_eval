    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution to the issue described. It suggests adding a new parameter `n_targets=None` to the `GaussianProcessRegressor` class, modifying the `fit` method to check if `n_targets` is set, and modifying the `sample_y` method to use the `n_targets` parameter to determine the shape of the output. These steps are in line with the git diff provided, which also introduces the `n_targets` parameter and includes checks and usage of this parameter in the `fit` and `predict` methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it achieves the same result by providing a clear and actionable guide for implementing the necessary changes. It also correctly identifies the need to raise an error if `n_targets` is not set before calling `fit`, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes additional guidance on documenting the new parameter and adding unit tests, which, while not present in the git diff, are best practices that contribute to the overall quality of the implementation. The RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `predict` method that are included in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, making it deserving of a high score.",
