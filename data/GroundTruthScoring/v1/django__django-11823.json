    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps and code modifications that are intended to address the issue of the `max_age` parameter overriding the `cache_page` timeout. It suggests modifying the `CacheMiddleware.__init__` method to use `self.page_timeout` as the default timeout, updating `UpdateCacheMiddleware.process_response` to prioritize `self.page_timeout`, and adjusting `patch_cache_control` to respect `page_timeout`. Additionally, it advises ensuring that `cache_page` and `cache_control` are used correctly in views.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in the sense that it recognizes the need to introduce a `page_timeout` attribute and to adjust the logic in `UpdateCacheMiddleware.process_response` to prioritize this new timeout. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to modify `patch_cache_control` is not supported by the git diff and seems to be an additional step that is not required to resolve the issue. Furthermore, the RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `cache_page` decorator in `django/views/decorators/cache.py` that are present in the git diff, which are crucial for ensuring that the `page_timeout` is correctly passed through when the `cache_page` decorator is used.\n\nThe RESPONSE's code snippets and explanations are relevant and provide some actionable advice, but they do not fully match the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE partially addresses the issue but is incomplete in terms of the changes needed according to the git diff. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff.",
