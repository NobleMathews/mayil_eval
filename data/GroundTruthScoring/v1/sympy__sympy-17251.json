    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `exp` function to handle periodicity by reducing the argument modulo `2*pi*I` when the argument is purely imaginary and adding a method `_eval_simplify` to the `exp` class. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about `exp` not simplifying based on its periodicity. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff, which makes specific changes to the `eval` method of the `exp` class to handle different cases of coefficients of `pi*I` and adds logic to handle the addition of terms involving `exp`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use `Mod` for reduction and to add a new method `_eval_simplify` is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not provide actionable changes that align with the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes references to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes made in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
