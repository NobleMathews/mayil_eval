    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `dataset_repr` function and introducing a helper function `is_small_and_local` to determine if a dataset is small and not cloud-backed. It also suggests using the `array.size` condition to decide whether to load the data for repr. However, the git diff indicates that the solution is to remove the `array.size < 1e5` condition from the `short_data_repr` function, which is different from the `dataset_repr` function mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests a different approach that involves additional checks and helper functions, which are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly focuses on the `dataset_repr` function and the introduction of a new function, which is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative.",
