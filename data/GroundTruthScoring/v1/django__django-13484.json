    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests avoiding the pickling of the entire queryset and instead pickling the parameters necessary to recreate the queryset. This approach does not align with the git diff provided, which introduces a new `identity` property and implements `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods for the `ForeignObjectRel` and `ManyToManyRel` classes to ensure that the equality and hashing of these objects are consistent and correct, likely addressing the issue with pickling and unpickling querysets involving `FilteredRelation`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `identity` property and the implementation of `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods. Instead, it provides an alternative solution that is not supported by the git diff and does not address the underlying issue described in the original problem. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the solution provided in the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to aid developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff. It suggests a workaround that does not solve the root cause of the problem, which is addressed by the git diff.",
