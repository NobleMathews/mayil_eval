    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a solution that is in line with the git diff's intention to handle zero-argument calls for `Min` and `Max` by returning `oo` and `-oo` respectively. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__new__` method in both `Min` and `Max` classes to check for zero arguments and return the appropriate value, which is a valid and effective alternative to the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to import `S.Infinity` and `S.NegativeInfinity` from `sympy`, which is necessary for the proposed changes to work. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides code snippets and references to the relevant lines in the source code, which would be very helpful for a developer looking to implement the fix.",
