    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice, such as ensuring that `msg` is a `unicode` object before performing operations and replacing the unicode literal with a properly encoded string. However, it does not align closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff specifically addresses the issue by adding a try-except block to handle the case where Jython cannot represent the lone surrogate, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `from __future__ import unicode_literals`, which is not present in the git diff and may not be necessary for the fix. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippet checks that do not contribute to solving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE offers some relevant advice but lacks alignment with the git diff's solution and includes unnecessary suggestions.",
