    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general strategies for dealing with GROUP BY clauses and subquery annotations in Django, such as using `.values()` before `.annotate()`, checking the `distinct()` call, and verifying the use of aggregate functions. However, these suggestions are generic and do not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve modifications to the `resolve_expression` and `get_group_by_cols` methods in the `django/db/models/expressions.py` file to ensure that subquery annotations are correctly included in the GROUP BY clause. The RESPONSE does not mention any changes to the `sql_mode` in the MySQL backend, which is also part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses GROUP BY behavior, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
