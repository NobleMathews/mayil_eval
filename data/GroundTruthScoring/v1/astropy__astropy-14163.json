{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the current behavior of `np.array_equal()` when used with `astropy.units.Quantity` instances with incompatible units, which is to raise a `UnitConversionError` instead of returning `False`. The RESPONSE suggests that the behavior should be consistent with other comparison operations in `astropy.units.Quantity` and provides a clear solution to modify the `astropy.units.quantity_helper.function_helpers.py` module to catch `UnitConversionError` and return `False`. This aligns closely with the git diff, which also modifies the same module to catch `UnitConversionError` and return `False`. The RESPONSE provides a pseudo code snippet that demonstrates the intended behavior, which is similar to the changes in the git diff, although it uses the `@function_helper` decorator instead of the `@dispatched_function` decorator used in the git diff. This difference in decorator usage does not affect the core solution to the problem, which is to handle the `UnitConversionError` and return `False`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
