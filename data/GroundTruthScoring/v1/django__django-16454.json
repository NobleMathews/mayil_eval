    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of subparsers not inheriting custom error formatting in Django management commands. It suggests modifying the `CommandParser` class to ensure that subparsers inherit the custom error formatting by updating the `add_subparsers` method to pass the `missing_args_message` to the subparsers. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the `add_subparsers` method, although the git diff does not mention the `missing_args_message`. Instead, the git diff uses a `partial` function to ensure that the `called_from_command_line` attribute is passed to the subparsers, which is a different approach but achieves a similar result. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that no changes are required in the `handle` method of the `BaseCommand` subclasses, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE provides actionable guidance and closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, although it does not match it exactly. Therefore, it scores a 7 as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
