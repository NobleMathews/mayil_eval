    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the logic that sets `order_by` to `None` when `_meta_ordering` is present, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff does not remove any logic but instead adds a conditional check to ensure that expressions from `order_by` are only added to `GROUP BY` when `_meta_ordering` is not present. However, the RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to ensure that `GROUP BY` is constructed based on the actual fields being grouped and not influenced by `Meta.ordering`. This aligns with the intent of the git diff to prevent `Meta.ordering` fields from being included in the `GROUP BY` clause. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing and integrating the test case from the PR, which is a valuable recommendation for ensuring the issue is resolved and correctly tested, but it does not directly relate to the code changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, but it is incomplete and does not fully match the git diff's solution.",
