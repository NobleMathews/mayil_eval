    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of class cleanups in Python 3.8+ not being called when using pytest.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance related to the git diff. It suggests verifying the use of `addClassCleanup` and `doClassCleanups`, and considering workarounds or reporting the issue, but it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as adding the `doClassCleanups` method and handling exceptions during setup. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippet checks that do not contribute to resolving the issue.",
