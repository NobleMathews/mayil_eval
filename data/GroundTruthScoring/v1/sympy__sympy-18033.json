    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general guide on how to deprecate the `Permutation.print_cyclic` flag and update the printers to handle permutation printing, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows the actual code changes made to remove the `Permutation.print_cyclic` flag and update various files to handle permutation printing through printer settings. The RESPONSE does not match any of these changes and does not provide any code or specific instructions that would help a developer implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue as described.",
