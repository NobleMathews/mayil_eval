    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue with the SpanSelector widget might be related to the `onselect` callback or the `interactive` parameter, and provides general advice on how to set axes limits and report the issue to the development team. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific problem described in the ISSUE, which is that the SpanSelector incorrectly forces axes limits to include 0 when `interactive=True` is set. The git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `_setup_edge_handle` method to use the current axis bounds instead of defaulting to include 0. The RESPONSE fails to identify this specific fix and instead offers general debugging steps that do not align with the git diff. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about the SpanSelector and its parameters, but it does not offer actionable guidance that would lead to the resolution of the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
