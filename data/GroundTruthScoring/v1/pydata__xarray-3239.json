    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a 'fastpath' parameter to the 'open_mfdataset' function and provides a high-level overview of how to implement it, including bypassing alignment and coordinate checking and assuming that all datasets share the same coordinates. This approach is somewhat aligned with the issue's request for a fast path option that bypasses alignment and coordinate checking. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a new 'compat' option 'override' to handle the fast path logic. The git diff shows extensive changes across multiple modules, indicating a more complex implementation than the RESPONSE suggests. The RESPONSE does not address the need to refactor existing functions or the integration of the new 'compat' option into the xarray codebase. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section on 'Code snippets to check' with links to benchmark tests and setup classes, which are not directly related to the implementation of the fast path feature and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
