    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `imshow()` function in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` file. It correctly identifies the need to conditionally set the `aspect` based on the `transform` argument, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, the RESPONSE's proposed code snippet does not match the git diff's solution. The git diff suggests a more nuanced approach where the aspect is set only if it is not `None` and if the image's transform does not contain the axes data transform. The RESPONSE's code snippet, on the other hand, suggests a simpler condition that does not fully capture the logic presented in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the changes to the documentation that are present in the git diff, which are important for explaining the new behavior of the `aspect` parameter. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers some value, it is incomplete and does not fully align with the git diff's solution.",
