{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a pseudo-code snippet that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `django/contrib/auth/checks.py` file and suggests using the `permission_codename_max_length` variable to determine the maximum allowed length for permission codenames. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests generating default permission codenames and checking if any exceed the maximum length, appending an error if necessary. The RESPONSE includes the registration of the new check function, which is an essential step in the Django system check framework.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the calculation of `max_builtin_permission_codename_length` and the adjustment of `model_name_max_length` based on the length of the model's name. However, the RESPONSE's approach is still valid and would effectively prevent the creation of permission codenames that exceed the maximum length. The RESPONSE also suggests a new error code (`auth.E013`), which is not present in the git diff but is a minor discrepancy and does not affect the overall utility of the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would help the developer implement a solution to the issue. It does not directly align with every aspect of the git diff but offers a valid, effective alternative approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
