    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows a change in the sphinx/domains/python.py file to fix the issue with cross-references in property's type annotations. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests checking the import of the `Point` class, implementing the `end` property method, verifying documentation, checking Sphinx configuration, updating Sphinx, and explicitly creating cross-references in the docstring. These suggestions do not address the actual code change needed in the Sphinx extension code, as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the file and section of the codebase that needs attention (sphinx/domains/python.py), but it fails to provide the specific change required, which is to parse the annotation and add it to the signode with the correct formatting. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not actionable in the context of the git diff and only marginally relevant due to the correct identification of the file involved.",
