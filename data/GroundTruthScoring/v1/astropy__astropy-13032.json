{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is with the handling of the `ignored` parameter in the `ModelBoundingBox` class, specifically when ignoring the `x` input, which is correct according to the ISSUE description. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable changes that align with the git diff. Instead, it offers a general approach to resolving the issue, such as modifying the `__setitem__` and `__delitem__` methods, without specific details on how to implement these changes. The RESPONSE also includes a list of code snippets to check, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer to locate the relevant code sections but does not offer direct solutions. The git diff, on the other hand, introduces a new property `_available_input_index` and modifies the `_validate_sequence` and `_validate` methods to use this property, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
