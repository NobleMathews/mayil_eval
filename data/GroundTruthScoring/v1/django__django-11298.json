    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature requested in the issue, which is to allow ManyToManyField using an intermediary table to be defined as symmetrical. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `ManyToManyField` class to accept a `symmetrical` argument even when a `through` model is provided and to update the `ManyToManyDescriptor` to handle symmetrical relationships with an intermediary table. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests removing the check for `fields.E332` when `symmetrical` is `True`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align perfectly with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the check for `fields.E332` has been completely removed from the `_check_relationship_model` method, whereas the RESPONSE suggests only removing the check when `symmetrical` is `True`. Additionally, the git diff includes changes to the `add` method in `related_descriptors.py` to handle symmetrical relationships with `through_defaults`, which the RESPONSE does not mention explicitly.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a pseudo-code outline for the changes to the `ManyToManyField` class, which is helpful, but it lacks the specific changes shown in the git diff. It also includes a detailed list of code snippets to check, which could be useful for a developer, but it does not directly address the changes in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and does not fully capture the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4.",
