    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance on how to change the default display style to HTML, which is the core of the issue. It correctly identifies the `OPTIONS` dictionary in `xarray/core/options.py` as the location for the default setting and suggests setting the `display_style` option to \"html\" to enable HTML representation by default. This aligns well with the git diff, which changes the `DISPLAY_STYLE` from \"text\" to \"html\". The RESPONSE also provides an alternative suggestion for disabling the HTML representation by default, which is not directly relevant to the issue but is a valid consideration for the opposite scenario. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, although these are not part of the git diff, they could be useful for understanding the context of the changes. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact lines of code changed, but it does provide a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is enabling HTML representation by default. Therefore, it scores an 8 as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
