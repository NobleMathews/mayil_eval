{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_context_data` method in the `OfferView` class to explicitly convert `offer_slug` to a string before calling `get_object_or_404`. While this does address the issue of ensuring that `offer_slug` is a string, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the Django framework itself, specifically changing the use of `SimpleLazyObject` to `lazy` in the `django/views/generic/base.py` file. The RESPONSE does not mention or address this change in the Django framework code. Instead, it focuses on a workaround in the user's code, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the symptom of the issue (the need to convert `offer_slug` to a string), but it does not provide a solution to the root cause as the git diff does. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 for offering a workaround that is somewhat relevant but does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
