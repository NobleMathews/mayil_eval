    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general outline of steps to implement the feature described in the issue, which includes creating a `_get_response_values` method in `CurveDisplayMixin`, refactoring existing code to use this method, removing redundant code, updating unit tests, deprecating `sklearn/metrics/_plot/base.py`, and updating documentation. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a comprehensive refactoring of several modules, including moving the `_check_pos_label_consistency` method and integrating a `_BinaryClassifierCurveDisplayMixin` into various display classes. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the integration of the mixin into the display classes. It also does not provide any code changes or detailed guidance on how to refactor the code to match the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue's theme of refactoring and improving the codebase, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
