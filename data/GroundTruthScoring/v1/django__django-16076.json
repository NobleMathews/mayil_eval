    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a custom lookup to allow 'startswith' filtering on the ForeignKey field's underlying column without causing a join. This approach is a valid alternative to modifying the Django ORM's internal behavior, which is what the git diff does. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of removing the checks that raise the FieldError exceptions when performing lookups on related fields. Instead, it introduces a new concept of a custom lookup, which is not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE could be a viable solution, it does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which simplifies the ORM's behavior by removing the restrictions on lookups for related fields. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff and offers an alternative that is not supported by the git diff.",
