    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance that is highly relevant to the issue described. It correctly suggests updating the `make_password` function to only accept `bytes` or `str` as arguments and to raise a `TypeError` if an invalid type is provided, which aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE also appropriately addresses the need to update the documentation to reflect these changes, ensuring that the behavior is clearly communicated to developers, which is in line with the issue's emphasis on consistency with documentation. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the `validate_password` function for consistency, which is relevant to the issue's concern about consistent behavior across different functions. However, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to ensure the `force_bytes` method is used appropriately within `make_password`, which is not mentioned in the git diff or the issue description. This part of the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff but does not detract significantly from the overall relevance of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not mention the exact code snippet to be changed, but it provides a general direction and links to the relevant code sections, which is helpful for locating the `make_password` function in the codebase.",
