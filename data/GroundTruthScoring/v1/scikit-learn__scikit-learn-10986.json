    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue correctly as being related to the incorrect shape of the `coef_` attribute during warm start with `multi_class='multinomial'` for binary outcomes. It suggests modifying the `fit` method to handle the shape of `coef_` correctly, which is aligned with the git diff's approach to addressing the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests reshaping `coef_` to a 2D array within the `fit` method, which is not exactly what the git diff does. The git diff specifically adds a condition to handle the case when `n_classes == 1` by setting `w0[0, :coef.shape[1]] = -coef` and `w0[1, :coef.shape[1]] = coef`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to reshape `coef_` does not directly address the broadcasting issue that the git diff resolves.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change needed but offers a general direction that could lead to a solution. It does not match the git diff's approach of handling the `w0` initialization but does address the broader issue of `coef_` shape handling during warm start. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff that would warrant a higher score.",
