    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to move the deprecation warning from the __init__ method to the fit method and to update the fit method accordingly. The RESPONSE also correctly advises adjusting test cases to reflect this change. However, the RESPONSE suggests using a placeholder value 'deprecated' for the contamination parameter in the __init__ method, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff uses 'legacy' as the placeholder and handles the deprecation warning and the setting of the _contamination attribute in the fit method. The RESPONSE does not mention the setting of the _contamination attribute, which is a key part of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in moving the deprecation warning and updating the fit method. It diverges slightly by suggesting a different placeholder value for the contamination parameter and not mentioning the setting of the _contamination attribute. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, providing a slightly different but still effective approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update test cases is also in line with the git diff's implications, although the git diff does not explicitly mention test cases.",
