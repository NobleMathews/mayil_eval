    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that could potentially help with the issue, such as increasing the figure size, reducing the font size, and using `set_in_layout(False)` on the `AnnotationBbox` instance. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff, which shows that the actual fix involves updating the positions of the children in the `get_window_extent` and `get_tightbbox` methods of the `offsetbox.py` file. The RESPONSE suggests using `set_in_layout(False)` as a workaround, which is mentioned in the issue description but does not address the underlying problem of `AnnotationBbox` not returning the correct `window_extent` before the first draw. The RESPONSE also suggests checking code snippets that are relevant to the issue, but it does not provide a direct solution to the problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in addressing the issue as per the git diff.",
