    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the 'rc_params_from_file' function uses 'utf-8' encoding by default, which aligns with the git diff's change to hardcode 'utf-8' as the encoding. However, the RESPONSE also suggests adding support for encoding cookies using 'tokenize.detect_encoding', which is not mentioned in the git diff and does not align with the issue's indication that supporting encoding cookies is probably not worth it. The RESPONSE also includes an example modification that is not reflected in the git diff, and it suggests modifying the test suite in a way that does not match the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant by mentioning the use of 'utf-8', it fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff and includes additional suggestions that are not supported by the git diff or the issue description.",
