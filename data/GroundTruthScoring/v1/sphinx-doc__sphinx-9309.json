    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `check_uri` function in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` to handle `ConnectionError` by falling back to a `GET` request if a `HEAD` request fails. This is in line with the git diff, which also adds handling for `ConnectionError` in the same function.\n\nThe RESPONSE correctly identifies that the `ConnectionError` should be caught and handled within the `try` block where `requests.head()` is called, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of adding an `except` block for `ConnectionError`.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE provides a code snippet that demonstrates how to catch the `ConnectionError` and perform a `GET` request, which is essentially what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly points out that the existing handling code for `HTTPError` and `TooManyRedirects` should remain as is.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's code but offers a viable alternative that achieves the same result, which is to handle `ConnectionError` exceptions appropriately. The RESPONSE also includes additional context by providing links to relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for the developer to understand where the changes need to be made.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the comment about servers dropping the connection on HEAD requests, which is present in the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is addressed effectively.",
