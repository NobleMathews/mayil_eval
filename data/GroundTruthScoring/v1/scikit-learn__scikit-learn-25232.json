    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the `fill_value` parameter to the `IterativeImputer` class and ensuring it is used correctly, which aligns with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE also includes a confusing statement about the `fill_value` parameter already being present, which contradicts the issue description and the git diff. This could lead to confusion and does not provide clear guidance. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed instructions on how to implement the solution, which makes it less actionable. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of providing a clear and complete solution to the issue.",
