    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align closely with the git diff. It suggests modifying the 'plot_partial_dependence' function to handle regressors correctly by checking if the estimator is a classifier before accessing the 'classes_' attribute. This is in line with the git diff, which adds a check for 'is_classifier(estimator)' before raising a ValueError for multiclass-multioutput estimators. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the 'classes_' attribute should not be set for a regressor like 'DecisionTreeRegressor' and suggests ensuring that this attribute is not set, which is a valid point but not directly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's approach of adding an additional check for the presence of the 'classes_' attribute before raising a ValueError, but it does suggest a similar logic flow that would prevent the error from occurring. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, although it does not directly match every aspect of it. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
