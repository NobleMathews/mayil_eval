    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the missing import for `models` in the generated migration file, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, it does not address the root cause of the problem, which is the missing import statement in the Django serializer that generates the migration file. The git diff shows that the fix should be made in the Django codebase itself, specifically in the `django/db/migrations/serializer.py` file, by adding the import statement to the `special_cases` list for `models.Model`. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking code snippets related to the `inspectdb` command, which is not directly relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
