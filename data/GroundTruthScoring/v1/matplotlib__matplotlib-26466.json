    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `annotate` function to create a copy of the `xy` parameter using `np.array(xy, copy=True)`. This advice is actionable and addresses the issue of the arrow position being updated when the `xy` array is modified after the annotation is created. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows changes in the `__init__` method of `_AnnotationBase` and the `__call__` method of `OffsetFrom`, where tuples are used to create a copy of the `xy` and `ref_coord` parameters. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use `np.array(xy, copy=True)` is not present in the git diff, and it introduces a dependency on NumPy that is not indicated by the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the need to copy the `xy` parameter but does not match the implementation shown in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 for providing a partially correct solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff.",
