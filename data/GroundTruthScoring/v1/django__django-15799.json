    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `SelectMultiple` class to ensure the `multiple` attribute is only set when `allow_multiple_selected` is `True`, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to adding a condition to check `form_field.widget.allow_multiple_selected` before setting the help text.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises updating the `ModelAdminForm` logic to check the `allow_multiple_selected` attribute before handling the help text, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a condition to check `allow_multiple_selected`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional steps that are not present in the git diff, such as modifying the `get_context` method of the `SelectMultiple` widget and adjusting the logic in the `ModelAdminForm` class. While these steps are not directly reflected in the git diff, they are relevant and could be considered as part of a comprehensive solution to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests changes to the `SelectMultiple` class that are not present in the diff. However, the RESPONSE's approach is effective and relevant, and it achieves a similar result to the git diff by ensuring that the help text is handled correctly based on the `allow_multiple_selected` attribute.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the codebase, which could be helpful for the developer to locate and understand the context of the changes needed.",
