    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides an explanation of why the timezone information is not considered when using `TruncDay` with `output_field=DateField()`. It correctly identifies that the `as_sql` method in the `TruncBase` class does not apply timezone conversion for `DateField`. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide a solution or guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the issue described. The git diff shows that changes were made to the `date_trunc_sql`, `time_trunc_sql`, and related methods across multiple database backends to include a `tzname` parameter and handle timezone conversions. The RESPONSE does not suggest modifying the code to include timezone handling for `DateField` or `TimeField`, which is the core of the issue and the solution provided in the git diff. Instead, it suggests using `DateTimeField` and handling the conversion in Python or with database functions, which does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the Django ORM to handle this internally. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
