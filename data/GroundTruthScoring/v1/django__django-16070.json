    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying field names and implementing validation for field existence, which is a general good practice but does not address the specific issue described. The issue is about the Django ORM's behavior of silently skipping non-existing fields in `order_by` clauses for related models, which is a bug that needs to be fixed in the Django codebase itself. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which involves modifying the Django ORM's internal handling of ordering by related fields. The RESPONSE does not suggest any changes to the Django codebase, nor does it mention the need to handle transforms, which is a key part of the git diff solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader topic of field validation in `order_by` clauses, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
