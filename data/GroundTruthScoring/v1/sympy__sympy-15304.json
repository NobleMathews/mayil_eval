    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general review of the `apply_load` method and related methods in the `Beam` class, which is relevant to the issue described. However, it does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core problem of the load equation formation for higher order forces. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to import `factorial` or the changes to the `apply_load` and `remove_load` methods that involve Taylor series expansion, which are key elements in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the need to review the load handling, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
