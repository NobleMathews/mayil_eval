    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides an explanation of why the user is seeing the output `1` when using the `degree` function on a rational function in SymPy. It correctly identifies that the `degree` function is primarily designed for polynomials and explains that it computes the degree of the numerator for rational functions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the `degree` function to handle the case when the second argument is not a number, and changes to the `_check` function to ensure that the degree is computed correctly when the function is linear in the symbol.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests a workaround by defining a custom function `rational_function_degree` to compute the degree of a rational function by taking the difference between the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. While this is a valid approach to compute the degree of a rational function, it does not address the changes made in the git diff, which aim to improve the `degree` function itself within the SymPy library.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the behavior of the `degree` function and provides a workaround, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to modifying the `degree` function to handle rational functions correctly. The score of 2 reflects that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff or provide a solution that aligns with the changes made in the git diff.",
