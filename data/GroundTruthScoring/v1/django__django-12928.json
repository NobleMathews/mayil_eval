    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing autoreload behavior for the cached template loader in Django, which is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to various files, including the creation of a new 'autoreload.py' module and modifications to 'cached.py', 'autoreload.py', and other files to implement the autoreload functionality. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying 'cached.py' to check for the 'autoreload' option and connect to a signal, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable code changes that match the git diff, such as the implementation of 'get_template_directories', 'reset_loaders', and signal receivers in the new 'autoreload.py' module. The RESPONSE also does not mention the changes to 'is_django_path' and 'is_django_module' functions, which are part of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the ISSUE.",
