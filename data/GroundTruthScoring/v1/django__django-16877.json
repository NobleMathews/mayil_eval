    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to implement the `escapeseq` filter in Django, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the file to be modified (`django/template/defaultfilters.py`), the need to define a new filter function (`escapeseq`), and the use of `conditional_escape` to escape each item in the sequence. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests registering the filter using the `register.filter` decorator and provides a code example that is very similar to the git diff solution. The RESPONSE includes additional helpful information, such as the need to add tests for the new filter and the usage example in a Django template. The only minor difference is that the RESPONSE includes an `if` check to ensure the value is a list or tuple, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as it is a reasonable check to include and does not conflict with the git diff's approach.",
