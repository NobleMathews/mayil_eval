{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to locate the `src/_pytest/fixtures.py` file and the specific lines where the current implementation of the `skip()` function and the string-hack are found. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests removing or refactoring the string-hack and ensuring that the `skip()` function reports the skip location as the test function for both regular and xunit setup fixtures. This aligns well with the git diff, which shows the removal of the string-hack and the adjustment to the skip.Exception handling to ensure the skip location is reported correctly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change shown in the git diff, which is the removal of the condition that checks if the fixture function name starts with \"xunit_setup\" and the addition of a comment explaining the change. Instead, it provides a more general instruction to remove or refactor the string-hack. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section on code snippets to check, which, while not directly related to the code change, could be seen as an attempt to guide the developer in testing the changes. This section does not add significant value to the RESPONSE in terms of fixing the issue but does not detract from the overall relevance of the RESPONSE to the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 as it provides clear guidance that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not include the exact code change and includes additional information that is not directly related to the solution.",
