    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of non-dimensional coordinates being demoted to variables after using `Coarsen.construct`. It suggests modifying the `Coarsen.construct` method to ensure that the original coordinates are preserved as coordinates in the resulting Dataset or DataArray after the coarsening operation. This aligns with the intent of the git diff, which is to fix the issue of coordinates not being preserved correctly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the `should_be_coords` set. The git diff introduces a change that combines the `window_dim` set with the original object's coordinates to ensure that the window dimensions are included as coordinates. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests setting the coordinates using the original object's coordinates without considering the `window_dim`. This misses the nuance of the git diff's solution, which specifically addresses the issue of window dimensions being unindexed.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a large section of code snippets to check, which, while potentially useful for a broader understanding of the codebase, do not directly contribute to solving the issue at hand. This part of the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance for fixing the specific issue described in the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 3, as it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and only partially relevant.",
