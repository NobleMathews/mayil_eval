    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `sqlmigrate` command and the `MigrationLoader.get_migration_by_prefix` method to handle squashed migrations and provide clear error messages. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `sqlmigrate.py` and `loader.py` files, including the removal of the `MigrationExecutor` and the addition of the `replace_migrations` parameter to control the replacement of migrations. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the removal of the `collect_sql` method from `executor.py` and its addition to `loader.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the problem of handling squashed migrations, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a clear alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
