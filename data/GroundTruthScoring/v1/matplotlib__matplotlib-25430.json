    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `savefig` function to ensure that `metadata` is not passed to methods that do not support it, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding checks and raising errors when metadata is passed to formats that do not support it. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the documentation to clearly state that metadata is not supported for JPEG files, which is in line with the git diff's addition of comments regarding metadata support in the documentation of `savefig`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result: preventing the passing of metadata to formats that do not support it and providing clear error messages. The RESPONSE's suggestion to implement a check within `savefig` to only include `metadata` in the call to the print method if the output format supports it is effectively what the git diff achieves by raising a ValueError when metadata is passed to unsupported formats.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that demonstrates how to modify the `savefig` function, which is actionable and relevant. However, the RESPONSE does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `metadata` parameter to the `print_jpg`, `print_tif`, and `print_webp` methods and the corresponding changes in the `_print_pil` calls. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a solution that would likely resolve the issue, it does not capture all the details of the git diff, which justifies a score of 7.",
