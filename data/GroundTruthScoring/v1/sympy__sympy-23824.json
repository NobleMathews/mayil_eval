    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to locate the loop in the `kahane_simplify()` function and ensure that it preserves the original order of uncontracted gamma matrices. It correctly identifies the issue as being related to the reversal of the order of uncontracted gamma matrices and provides a general direction for fixing it by adjusting the logic to maintain the correct order.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows that the fix involves changing the loop to a list comprehension that concatenates the `free_pos` list with each element in `resulting_indices`. The RESPONSE suggests using `append(...)` or adjusting the logic but does not provide the specific solution shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes unnecessary details about checking code snippets in a GitHub repository, which is not relevant to the actual code change needed to fix the issue. This information does not add value to the developer in fixing the issue and could potentially lead to confusion.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of order reversal but does not provide the specific solution or match the approach taken in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
