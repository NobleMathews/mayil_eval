    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a `dtype` argument to the `MaxAbsScaler` class and modifying related methods to preserve the input array's data type, which is a reasonable approach to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which instead fixes the issue by ensuring that `check_array` correctly infers the data type from the input array's dtypes without requiring an additional `dtype` argument. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `check_array` function, which is the key change in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `ColumnTransformer` and adding tests, which, while potentially useful, are not part of the git diff and do not directly address the core issue of `MaxAbsScaler` upcasting the data type. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the dtype preservation but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
