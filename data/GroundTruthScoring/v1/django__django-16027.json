    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `timesince` function to use an average month length of 30.4 days for calculations and to replace the `MONTHS_DAYS` tuple with a single value representing the average number of days in a month. However, the git diff shows a different approach to solving the issue. The git diff does not use an average month length; instead, it introduces a `MONTHS_DAYS` tuple to account for the varying number of days in each month and modifies the calculation of years and months accordingly. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of using actual month lengths and adjusting the pivot datetime calculation based on the specific month lengths. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the suggested average month length, which makes it less actionable. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of incorrect timesince calculations, but it does not offer a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff's method of addressing the problem.",
