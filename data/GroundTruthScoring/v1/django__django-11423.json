    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a workaround to the issue by modifying the way the `Tag` model is accessed within the `Book` and `CD` models, using a property to return the first tag. This approach does not directly address the underlying issue with the `prefetch_related` mechanism and the incorrect caching behavior described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which provides a more comprehensive solution by modifying the `get_prefetch_queryset` method to correctly handle the caching of objects when using `GenericRelation` and `prefetch_related` together. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach, as it does not address the core problem of incorrect caching in the `_prefetched_objects_cache`. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information regarding the setup of `GenericForeignKey` and the use of properties to access related objects, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that would resolve the issue as effectively as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
