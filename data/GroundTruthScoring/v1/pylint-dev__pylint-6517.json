    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to review and verify the handling of the 'confidence=' setting in the pylint configuration, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a direct change to the `_confidence_transformer` function to handle an empty value for 'confidence=' by returning the default `CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NAMES`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader review of the configuration parser and related files without pinpointing the exact change needed. It also incorrectly references updating `pylint/constants.py` and `pylint/checkers/base/basic_checker.py`, which are not part of the solution in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `_confidence_transformer` function or returning a default value when 'confidence=' is empty, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
