    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a direct solution to the issue by instructing the developer to remove the `USERNAME_FIELD` from the `REQUIRED_FIELDS` list in the custom user model, which is the root cause of the issue described. It also includes a corrected code snippet that demonstrates the necessary changes, which is actionable and relevant.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not address the part of the issue that involves adding a hint to the error message, which is a significant part of the git diff. The git diff includes a modification to the checks.py file to add a hint to the error message, which the RESPONSE does not mention.\n\nThe RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance for part of the issue but does not fully align with the git diff as it omits the addition of the hint. Therefore, it scores a 7, as it is helpful and actionable but incomplete in addressing the full scope of the issue as represented by the git diff.",
