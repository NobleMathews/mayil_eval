{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It addresses the specific issue of non-string dictionary keys not being handled correctly by the SafeExceptionReporterFilter's cleanse_setting method.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'cleanse_setting' method to handle non-string dictionary keys correctly, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the dictionary comprehension within the 'elif isinstance(value, dict):' block to avoid applying the regex to non-string keys. This matches the git diff's intent to prevent the regex application on non-string keys. However, the RESPONSE does not include the refactoring of the try-except block to handle TypeError, which is present in the git diff. This omission means the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff, but it still provides a viable solution to the issue described. Therefore, it receives a score of 7 for its relevance and actionable guidance, despite not capturing every aspect of the git diff.",
