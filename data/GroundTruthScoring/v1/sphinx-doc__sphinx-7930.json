    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions such as adding the custom type to `autodoc_type_aliases`, ensuring proper documentation, checking the `builtin_resolver`, and adding the custom type to `nitpick_ignore`. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff, which shows modifications to the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file to pass the `env` parameter to various functions and to include additional context in the cross-reference nodes. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, which are related to the handling of type annotations and cross-references within the Sphinx documentation generation process.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but these do not directly address the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the implementation of the changes shown in the git diff, nor does it offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue as per the git diff provided.",
