    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive guide on how to address the issue, including updating the deprecation documentation, adding an example warning message, ensuring the `NODE_USE_FROM_PARENT` warning points to the deprecation documentation, providing a \"before -> after\" example, and ensuring `from_parent` does not support `config/session`. This aligns well with the git diff, which updates the warning message to include a link to the deprecation documentation. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `Node.from_parent` method to not accept `config/session`, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact changes made to the codebase, but it offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to improve the deprecation documentation and guide users on the transition to `Node.from_parent`. The RESPONSE also includes additional steps such as checking pre-commit hook configurations and ReadTheDocs project configuration, which are not part of the git diff but are relevant to the overall quality and accessibility of the documentation.",
