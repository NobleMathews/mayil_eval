    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of parsing expressions with powers and ensuring that `expr1 - expr2` evaluates to zero.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `expand_power_exp` function from SymPy to expand the exponent over the product to ensure that `expr1` and `expr2` are simplified to the same form. However, this advice does not align with the git diff provided, which makes extensive changes to the `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser` module to handle parsing and tokenization of expressions differently, including handling of numbers and symbols, and adding checks for the types of `local_dict` and `global_dict`.\n\nThe git diff does not mention or involve the use of `expand_power_exp` or any other external function to address the issue. Instead, it modifies the internal workings of the parser to correctly handle such expressions. The RESPONSE fails to address the actual changes needed in the codebase as per the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the parsing issue described in the ISSUE.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not contribute to resolving the issue as described. It does not provide any insights into locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff, and thus it receives a score of 0.",
