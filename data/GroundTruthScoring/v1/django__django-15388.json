    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `BASE_DIR` is defined correctly and modifying the `TEMPLATES` configuration to exclude `BASE_DIR` directly, which is not directly related to the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by adding a check in the `template_changed` function to return early if the file path has a `.py` suffix, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the development server not restarting when `BASE_DIR` is added to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` and instead provides general advice on configuring `TEMPLATES` and checking the autoreload system. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in the context of Django settings and the autoreload system, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue described. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
