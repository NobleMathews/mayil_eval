    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py` file to include a feature flag for window function support based on the SQLite version, which is aligned with the git diff that adds a feature flag for the over clause based on the SQLite version. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `as_sql` method within the `Window` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` to check for window function support before compiling the SQL, which is in line with the git diff that adds a check for the over clause support and raises a `NotSupportedError` if it's not supported. The RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that the `supports_over_clause` feature flag is consistent with the new `supports_window_functions` flag or to refactor to use the new flag where appropriate is a reasonable approach to maintain consistency in the codebase. The RESPONSE provides actionable steps and code snippets that are relevant to the issue and closely match the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. However, the RESPONSE introduces a new flag `supports_window_functions` instead of using the `supports_over_clause` flag directly as seen in the git diff. This difference does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the proposed solution would still effectively resolve the issue, but it is not a direct match to the git diff, hence the score of 8.",
