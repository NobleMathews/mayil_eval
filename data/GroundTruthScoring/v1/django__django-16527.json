{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `show_save_as_new` tag in the Django admin and suggests modifying the logic to include a check for `has_add_permission`. This aligns with the git diff, which also adds the `has_add_permission` check to the condition for displaying the 'Save as new' button. However, the RESPONSE suggests removing the check for `has_change_permission` from the return statement, which is not supported by the git diff. The git diff retains the `has_change_permission` check and only adds the `has_add_permission` check. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff and provides links to various code snippets in the repository, which may or may not be directly relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice but does not fully align with the git diff, hence a score of 4 is appropriate.",
