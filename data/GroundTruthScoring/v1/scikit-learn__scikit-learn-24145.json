{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, providing clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff and addresses the issue of adding sparse matrix output to the `SplineTransformer`. It correctly suggests adding a new parameter to control the output format, updating the `fit_transform` and `transform` methods, and ensuring compatibility with the required SciPy version. The RESPONSE also includes pseudo-code that mirrors the logic in the git diff, such as handling the sparse output and combining the results from each feature. Additionally, it mentions updating documentation and tests, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the version check for SciPy that is present in the git diff, but it does allude to ensuring compatibility with the `design_matrix` method, which implies a version check. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
