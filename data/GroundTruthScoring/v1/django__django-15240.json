    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new management command to clean up the `django_migrations` table, which is a reasonable approach to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of integrating the pruning functionality directly into the existing `migrate` command. The RESPONSE also does not mention the new `--prune` argument that the git diff introduces, which is a key aspect of the proposed solution. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of deleting nonexistent migrations and considers the `replaces` attribute of squashed migrations, it fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's implementation. The RESPONSE also includes pseudo-code and references to code snippets, which are not directly relevant to the git diff's changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore, it receives a low score.",
