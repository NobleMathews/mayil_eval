    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `get_backend` function to accept a callable as an engine, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to allow custom backends. However, the RESPONSE suggests using a callable directly, while the git diff indicates the use of a subclass of `BackendEntrypoint`. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation, as it suggests checking for a callable and ensuring it adheres to the `BackendEntrypoint` interface, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff modifies the `engine` parameter documentation to indicate that a subclass of `BackendEntrypoint` can be used and adjusts the `get_backend` function to handle a subclass of `BackendEntrypoint` rather than a callable. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of simplifying the addition of custom backends, but it does not align with the git diff's approach of using a subclass. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary code snippets and links to the repository, which are not part of the git diff and do not add value in the context of the issue.",
