    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear instructions on how to add matplotlib to the `show_versions()` function, which is the main goal of the issue. It correctly identifies the need to add \"matplotlib\" to the list of dependencies in the `_get_deps_info()` function, which is exactly what the git diff shows. However, the RESPONSE also suggests importing matplotlib at the beginning of the file and ensuring that the version is printed out in the `show_versions()` function. The git diff does not include these additional steps, and they are not necessary for resolving the issue since the `_get_deps_info()` function is responsible for gathering the version information, not the import statement. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff but provides a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, but it includes unnecessary steps that are not supported by the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
