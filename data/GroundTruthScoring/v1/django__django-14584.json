    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the PR and ensuring backward compatibility, which is generally good advice but does not directly address the specific changes needed to include the database alias in the logging output, as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide any code-level guidance or specific instructions that would help the developer make the necessary changes to the codebase. It also does not mention modifying the 'debug_sql' function or the logger.debug call, which are key elements in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader context of the issue (reviewing a PR related to the issue), but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
