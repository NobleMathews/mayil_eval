    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of incorrect whitespace in CREATE INDEX statements in Django.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_index_columns` method in the `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor` class within `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff instead modifies the `__str__` method in the `Columns` class within `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py` to handle the whitespace issue correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of fixing the whitespace issue directly in the `Columns` class. Instead, it proposes a different method and file to be modified, which does not address the specific issue described.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes a potential solution that is not supported by the git diff, and it does not provide any insights into the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of checks for non-empty suffixes and the correct formatting of column strings.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead the developer away from the correct file and method that need to be modified according to the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a valid alternative approach to resolving the issue.",
