    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a `max_iter` parameter to the `MeanShift` class and updating the `MeanShift.fit` method to use this parameter, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `mean_shift` function to accept a `max_iter` parameter and pass it to `_mean_shift_single_seed`, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention updating the `fit` method to handle the new `max_iter` parameter in the same way as the git diff, which includes additional logic for handling the results and updating `self.n_iter_`. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE effectively addresses the issue of API inconsistency between `mean_shift` and `MeanShift.fit` by proposing a solution that maintains backward compatibility and aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
