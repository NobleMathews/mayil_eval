    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the `requote_uri` function in `requests/utils.py`, which is aligned with the git diff that modifies the same function to handle URLs with percent-encoded characters. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `requests.get` function should use `requote_uri` to handle special characters in URLs. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific changes needed, such as the introduction of the try-except block and the differentiation between safe characters with and without the percent sign, which are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking other parts of the code that are not directly related to the issue, such as proxy handling and URL construction in `models.py`, which are not addressed in the git diff. This makes the RESPONSE only partially relevant to the issue at hand.",
