    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of checks and suggestions that are relevant to the issue described. It advises the user to verify the validity and non-emptiness of the parameter ranges, the configuration of the cross-validation generator, the scoring parameter, and the n_iter parameter. These are all relevant to the issue of the ValueError being raised due to no fits being performed or inconsistent results from cv.split and cv.get_n_splits.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly suggest the changes made in the git diff, which adds explicit error handling to the code to raise informative errors when no fits are performed or when there is an inconsistency in the expected number of splits. However, the RESPONSE's suggestions to verify the configuration of the RandomizedSearchCV could lead the developer to discover the underlying issue that the git diff aims to address with its error messages.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets that are relevant to the issue, although they do not directly address the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact solution as the git diff but offers a viable alternative approach to troubleshooting the problem, which is to ensure that the RandomizedSearchCV is correctly configured and to consider updating the libraries if the issue persists.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable advice that could help the developer identify the cause of the issue, even though it does not match the git diff's approach of adding error messages.",
