    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the test case and the usage of SimpleLazyObject, as well as ensuring compatibility with the Subquery's output field. It also recommends checking the regression against a specific commit and updating the method to be compatible with the current Django version.\n\nHowever, the git diff indicates that the solution to the issue involves modifying the Django framework's code, specifically the `output_field` property in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`. The RESPONSE does not address this aspect of the issue at all. Instead, it focuses on potential changes in the test case and the handling of SimpleLazyObject, which is not aligned with the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some general debugging steps that could be relevant to similar issues, such as checking for regressions and ensuring compatibility with Django's version changes. However, these steps do not directly help resolve the specific issue described, which is why the RESPONSE receives a low score.",
