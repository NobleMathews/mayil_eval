    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some general advice on how to use the MissingIndicator with non-numeric data, such as ensuring the 'missing_values' parameter matches the placeholder in the data and checking for version compatibility issues. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which includes refactoring the input validation into a separate method and updating the estimator checks to handle string inputs properly.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests confirming data types and updating library versions, which are somewhat relevant but do not offer actionable steps that align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests that the MissingIndicator may not be capable of handling string or object data types, which contradicts the git diff that explicitly adds support for these types.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a solution to the TypeError issue described in the original issue, nor does it mention the refactoring or the estimator checks updates that are part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
