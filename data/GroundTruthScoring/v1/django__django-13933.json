    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests updating the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid value in the error message for `invalid_choice` and modifying the `validate` method to pass the `value` parameter to the `ValidationError`. This is in line with the git diff, which also modifies the `to_python` method to raise a `ValidationError` with the `params` argument containing the invalid value. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `validate` method is a reasonable alternative to the git diff's approach of modifying the `to_python` method, as both methods are involved in the validation process and could be used to raise the `ValidationError` with the necessary information. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for consistency between `ModelChoiceField` and `ModelMultipleChoiceField` in terms of error messaging, which is relevant to the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not directly modify the `to_python` method as shown in the git diff, but the alternative approach is still valid and effective.",
