    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to set the 'disabled' property to 'True' by default in the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashField` class, which is the key change reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests removing the `clean_password` method from the `UserChangeForm` class, as it becomes unnecessary with the introduction of the 'disabled' property, which is also in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE goes further by providing guidance on locating the class within the file and suggesting running tests to ensure no regressions are introduced, which is valuable advice for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not explicitly mention the removal of the `bound_data` and `has_changed` methods, which are also part of the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the primary issue is addressed effectively.",
