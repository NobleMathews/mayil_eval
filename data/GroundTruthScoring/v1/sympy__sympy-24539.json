    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `PolyElement.as_expr` method to handle the passed symbols appropriately and to use the provided symbols if they are given. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests adding a check to ensure the number of provided symbols matches the number of generators in the ring and to raise a `ValueError` if the number is incorrect. This matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's error message, but this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the core issue is addressed effectively. The RESPONSE also includes references to code snippets that might be related to the handling of symbols in 'PolyElement.as_expr()', which could be helpful for further investigation, although this is not directly related to the fix. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
