    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a test case to `tests/test_pycode_ast.py` at line 57, which is relevant to the issue as it involves testing tuple rendering. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide the correct test case format and content that matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that the function responsible for rendering tuples includes a trailing comma for single-element tuples, which is aligned with the issue's requirement but does not provide specific guidance on how to implement this change. The git diff shows a specific change in the `visit_Tuple` method to handle zero-element and single-element tuples correctly, which the RESPONSE does not address. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
