{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary changes to the `urlencode()` function in `django/utils/http.py` to include the key in the `TypeError` message when `None` is passed as data. The RESPONSE's suggested code change matches the git diff's approach, including the specific string formatting to include the key in the error message. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the location of the `urlencode()` function and provides a detailed explanation of the changes needed, which aligns with the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises the developer to create tests for the change, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the code snippet provided, as it does not include the changes for the loop that handles sequences, but it captures the essence of the required change. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
