    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `autowrap` function to handle array arguments correctly and to ensure that the generated C function signature uses pointers for array arguments. It also mentions checking if any of the `args` are instances of `MatrixSymbol` and adjusting the C function signature generation logic accordingly. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in the `codegen.py` file, specifically in the `routine` method, where a helper function `dimensions` is introduced to streamline the creation of metadata for array dimensions. The RESPONSE does not mention this helper function or the refactoring of the dimension metadata creation. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly focuses on the `autowrap` function and provides code snippet links that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves refactoring the code to handle dimensions of array-like arguments in a more consistent manner. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
