    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `dataset_repr` function and adding a new option `display_max_vars` to the `OPTIONS` dictionary to control the maximum number of variables to display. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of limiting the number of variables printed to the console, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `_mapping_repr` function and the addition of a `max_rows` parameter, as well as the introduction of the `DISPLAY_MAX_ROWS` option in the `OPTIONS` dictionary. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the relevant functions and options. Instead, it suggests a different approach involving the `dataset_repr` function and a new option `display_max_vars`, which is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE lacks actionable content that matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff.",
