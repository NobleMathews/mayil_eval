    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the modification of a read-only mask on a masked array when using `plt.pcolormesh`. It accurately points out that the `matplotlib.cbook.safe_masked_invalid` function is likely causing the issue by trying to modify the mask of the input arrays `X` and `Y`. The RESPONSE then provides a solution that involves ensuring `matplotlib.cbook.safe_masked_invalid` does not attempt to modify the mask if it is read-only and suggests creating a writable copy of the mask before modifying it. The RESPONSE also includes an example fix that is conceptually similar to the git diff, which adds a `copy=True` parameter to the `cbook.safe_masked_invalid` function call to ensure a copy is made. The RESPONSE's alternative solution of creating a separate function to handle the writable mask is a valid and effective approach, even though it is not the exact change made in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's simpler approach of just adding `copy=True` to the existing function calls, but it achieves the same result of avoiding modification of a read-only mask. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's intent to fix the issue.",
