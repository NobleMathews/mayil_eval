    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate description of the steps needed to implement the Schur number feature, which is consistent with the git diff. It correctly outlines the need to verify the implementation of the `SchurNumber` class and the `schur_partition` function, implement the `lower_bound` method, and add test cases. The RESPONSE also includes a high-level overview of the implementation and example usage, which is helpful for understanding how the feature should work.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff line by line but provides a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result. It suggests verifying the implementation and ensuring that the `SchurNumber` class can evaluate known Schur numbers and provide a lower bound for unknown values, which is in line with the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE emphasizes the importance of handling edge cases and testing, which is crucial for a robust implementation.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the specific implementation details of the `schur_partition` function and the `_generate_next_list` helper function, which are present in the git diff. However, it does mention the need to ensure that the `schur_partition` function returns the correct partition, which is the ultimate goal of these functions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, warranting a score of 9.",
