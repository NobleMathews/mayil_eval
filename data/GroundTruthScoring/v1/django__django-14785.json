    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of changes to handle `NaN` values in `DecimalField` and related classes, which is relevant to the issue of `NaN` values not being handled correctly in Django's SQLite backend. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically adds a check for `NaN` values in the `to_python` method of the `DecimalField` class and raises a `ValidationError` if such a value is encountered. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests returning `decimal.Decimal('NaN')` for `NaN` values and making several other changes across different classes and files, which is a different approach from the one in the git diff. While the RESPONSE's approach could be a valid alternative, it is more complex and involves multiple changes across the system, which may not be necessary to address the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or examples, making it less actionable. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
