    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the 'modify_sys_path' function to ensure that the first item is only removed from 'sys.path' if it is an empty string, '.', or the current working directory, which aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle cases where the 'PYTHONPATH' environment variable affects 'sys.path'. However, the RESPONSE includes an additional check for 'env_pythonpath.endswith(\":\") and cwd not in env_pythonpath' which is not present in the git diff. This additional check is not necessary to resolve the issue as described and could potentially introduce new behavior not accounted for in the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not perfectly match the git diff but still provides a viable solution to the problem. The inclusion of code snippets to check is helpful, but it does not directly contribute to the solution and thus does not increase the score.",
