    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary changes to both the `sensitive_variables` and `sensitive_post_parameters` decorators to prevent incorrect usage, as outlined in the git diff. It suggests adding a check to raise a `TypeError` if a single callable argument is passed to either decorator, which is exactly what the git diff implements. The RESPONSE also includes the correct error messages and is fully consistent with the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides the correct context and rationale behind the changes, which aligns with the issue description. The inclusion of the code snippets and the suggestion to add tests further supports the developer in implementing and verifying the fix. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offers clear guidance, and matches the git diff in addressing the specific issue presented.",
