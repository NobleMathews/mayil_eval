    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear explanation of the issue and suggests a modification to the `_print_Pow` method to handle the case when the base is 1 and the exponent is a negative `Rational` number. This is in line with the git diff, which also modifies the `_print_Pow` method to handle specific cases that cause a `RecursionError`. However, the RESPONSE's suggested code change does not match the git diff's approach of handling `(1/x)^(-y)` and `(-1/-x)^(-y)` cases specifically. Instead, it offers a more general condition for when the base is 1 and the exponent is a negative `Rational`. While this could potentially resolve the issue, it does not align with the git diff's precise solution, which includes additional checks and a different LaTeX string format for the problematic expressions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but does not fully match the git diff's approach.",
