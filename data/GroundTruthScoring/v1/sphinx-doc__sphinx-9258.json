    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement support for union types using the vertical bar/pipe in Sphinx, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to modify the Python domain within Sphinx and suggests updating the type parsing logic to recognize the '|' symbol as a delimiter for union types. The RESPONSE also provides a pseudo-code example, which is a good approach to explaining the necessary changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff by focusing on updating the regular expression used to parse types, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The git diff modifies the 'delims' regular expression to include the '|' symbol, and the RESPONSE suggests a similar approach.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact regular expression change as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE also includes additional suggestions and pseudo-code that are not directly reflected in the git diff, such as creating a new node type or updating rendering logic, which are not necessary according to the git diff. These additional suggestions are not incorrect but go beyond the scope of the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it includes additional steps that are not required by the git diff, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
