    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `regex` module instead of `re` and replacing `re.compile` with `regex.compile` in the Pylint codebase. However, the git diff does not indicate a switch to the `regex` module; instead, it shows the addition of a new function `_regex_transformer` to handle the compilation of regular expressions with better error handling. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of improving the existing `re.compile` usage within Pylint and does not offer a viable alternative solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `.pylintrc` configuration file to indicate the use of the `regex` module, which is not supported by the git diff or the Pylint codebase. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist developers in fixing the issue as described.",
