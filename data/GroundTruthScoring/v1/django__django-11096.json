    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of supporting the use of `admin_order_field` on properties in the Django admin. It correctly identifies the files and locations where changes need to be made, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests modifying `admin_list.py` to handle `admin_order_field` for properties, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is very similar to the git diff, indicating the use of `isinstance(attr, property)` and `hasattr(attr, 'fget')` to check for properties and their getters. The RESPONSE also correctly advises ensuring that `admin_order_field` refers to a valid field name on the model for ordering. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to `main.py` as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. Despite this, the RESPONSE provides a highly relevant and nearly complete solution to the issue.",
