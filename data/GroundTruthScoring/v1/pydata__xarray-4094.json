    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'to_unstacked_dataset' method to include a 'compat' parameter and passing it to the 'Dataset' constructor, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves changing the order of operations by moving the 'drop=True' parameter from the 'squeeze' method to the 'sel' method. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of the 'MergeError' due to single-dimension variables and does not provide a solution that would resolve the problem described in the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not provide an effective alternative solution.",
