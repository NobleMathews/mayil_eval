    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general strategy for addressing the issue of dtype changes during deep copying of `IndexVariable` objects, which is relevant to the issue described. It suggests preserving the dtype explicitly during the copy operation, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to ensure dtype consistency. However, the RESPONSE does not directly reference the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of type annotations, the use of `DTypeLike`, or the specific implementation of the `copy` method in the `PandasIndexAdapter` class. Instead, it provides a pseudo-code example that does not match the git diff's approach and suggests checking the dtype of `IndexVariable` objects, which is not part of the git diff solution. The RESPONSE also includes unnecessary references to code snippets and files that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is on the right track in terms of preserving dtype, it does not provide a complete or accurate solution compared to the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant.",
