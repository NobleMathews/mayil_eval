    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_iter_grouped` method in the `DataArrayGroupBy` class to handle empty groups properly, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff adds a check in the `__init__` method of the groupby operation to raise a `ValueError` if the group is empty, preventing the iteration from occurring in the first place. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `_iter_grouped` method and yield an empty `DataArray` does not align with the git diff's approach of raising an error early on. While the RESPONSE's approach could be a valid alternative, it does not prevent the `StopIteration` error from occurring as the git diff does. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but these do not directly contribute to resolving the issue as described in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
