    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to address the issue with the `date` filter when using the `\"r\"` argument and suggests ensuring that day names are not translated, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of raising a TypeError for date objects, making the datetime object aware, and using the `format_datetime_rfc5322` function from the `email.utils` module. Instead, it suggests modifying the translation function or introducing a new format string, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which are not directly related to the solution but provide context for the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE offers a partial solution that is relevant but does not align closely with the git diff's approach.",
