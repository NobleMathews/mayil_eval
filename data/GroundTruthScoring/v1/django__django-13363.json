    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and step-by-step guide on how to modify the `TruncBase` class and its subclasses `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` to handle the `tzinfo` parameter correctly, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_tzname` method in the `TimezoneMixin` class to use the `tzinfo` attribute if provided, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using `self.get_tzname()` to obtain the timezone name. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `as_sql` methods in `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` need to be updated to use the `tzname` from `get_tzname`, which is consistent with the git diff changes.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by suggesting additional changes to database backend operations and updating documentation, which are not part of the git diff but are relevant for a complete implementation of the feature. The RESPONSE also includes a suggestion to add tests, which is a good practice but not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly provide the exact code changes as seen in the git diff, but it offers a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result, which is to ensure that `TruncDate` and `TruncTime` respect the `tzinfo` parameter.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 because it includes additional steps that are not part of the git diff, such as updating backend operations and documentation, and it does not provide the exact code changes. However, it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
