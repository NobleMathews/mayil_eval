    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a new `_validate_data` method in the `ImageHDU` class to check for zero-dimensional ndarrays and raise an error if encountered. It also suggests updating the `writeto` method to include the `overwrite` parameter and pass it to the underlying file writing mechanisms. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of zero-dimensional data, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `data` property where it raises a `TypeError` if the data shape is zero-dimensional, which is a more direct and simpler solution than what the RESPONSE suggests. The RESPONSE also includes handling the `overwrite` parameter, which is not related to the issue at hand and is not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
