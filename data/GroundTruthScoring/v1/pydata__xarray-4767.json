    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue. It suggests replacing or removing the non-existing dimension or using the `expand_dims` method before transposing, which does not align with the git diff's approach of adding a `missing_dims` parameter to handle missing dimensions. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to the `transpose` method in `xarray/core/dataset.py` and provides irrelevant links to code snippets. The git diff shows changes in `xarray/core/dataarray.py` and `xarray/core/utils.py`, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the specific problem of inconsistent behavior with the Ellipsis usage in the `transpose` method, which is the core of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in resolving the issue and does not align with the git diff, but it does mention the concept of handling missing dimensions, which is somewhat relevant, hence the score of 1.",
