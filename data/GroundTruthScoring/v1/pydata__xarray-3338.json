    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests verifying the presence of the 'z' dimension and ensuring it is not dropped, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as adding error handling for NaN bin edges, raising errors when no data falls within bins, adding a '_dims' attribute, or modifying the error messages and function signatures to include 'xarray.ALL_DIMS'. The RESPONSE also suggests checking for changes in behavior from previous versions and updating xarray, which is not directly related to the code changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide the specific and actionable steps needed to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff, thus it receives a low score.",
