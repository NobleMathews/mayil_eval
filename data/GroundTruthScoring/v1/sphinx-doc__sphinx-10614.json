    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue with the `sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` extension and offers a solution to fix the incorrect relative links in SVG diagrams. It suggests modifying the `html_visit_inheritance_diagram` function to use `relative_path` from `docutils.utils` to calculate the correct relative paths, which is a reasonable approach to the problem.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff modifies the URL construction logic to handle external references via intersphinx and adjusts the relative path for SVG output. It does not use `relative_path` from `docutils.utils` as suggested in the RESPONSE. Instead, it constructs the reference name based on whether the reference is internal or external and then assigns the `refuri` or `refid` accordingly.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to use `relative_path` could potentially be a valid alternative, but it does not match the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the specific handling of external references via intersphinx, which is a key part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers an incomplete solution compared to the git diff.",
