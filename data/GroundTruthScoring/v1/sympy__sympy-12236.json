    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of the incorrect result with the `apart()` function in the SymPy library. Instead, it provides generic advice and references unrelated code snippets from the SymPy repository. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes related to the `from_FractionField` method in the `polynomialring.py` file, which is the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE also fails to provide any insights into the actual problem with the `apart()` function or how to fix it, making it entirely unhelpful for a developer trying to resolve the issue.",
