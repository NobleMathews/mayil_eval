    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and relevant solution to the issue of suggesting commands for mistyped management commands in a Django project. It suggests modifying the `ManagementUtility` class to include a method for suggesting similar command names and overriding the `execute` method to catch `CommandError` exceptions. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the use of the `difflib.get_close_matches` function, which is aligned with the git diff's use of the same function to provide command suggestions. However, the RESPONSE suggests adding new methods and overriding the `execute` method, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff directly modifies the `fetch_command` method to include the suggestion logic. Despite this difference in approach, the RESPONSE's solution is still a valid and effective alternative to the git diff, as it achieves the same end goal of providing command suggestions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its high relevance and clear guidance, despite not matching the git diff exactly.",
