    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `polylog` function, including the removal of `exp_polar(-I*pi)` and the addition of special cases for `s == 2` and `z` being certain fractions involving `sqrt(5)`. The RESPONSE, however, focuses on a general explanation of the `exp_polar` term and its role in handling branch cuts, without addressing the specific changes in the git diff. It does suggest a modification to the `_eval_expand_func` method to avoid introducing `exp_polar`, which is aligned with the git diff, but it fails to mention the specific cases for `s == 2` and the handling of `z` values that are addressed in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a complete solution to the issue described, and it does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach. The score of 1 reflects the minimal relevance of the RESPONSE to the git diff.",
