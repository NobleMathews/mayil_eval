{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and relevant solution to make the `makemigrations` command script-friendly, which aligns closely with the git diff. It suggests adding a `--scriptable` option and modifying the output behavior to separate progress output and the paths of created migration files, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes a high-level overview of the changes and a code snippet that illustrates the necessary modifications, which are in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details, such as the use of a `log_output` property and the exact handling of the `stderr` style function, but it achieves the same end result. The RESPONSE's alternative approach of directly swapping `self.stderr` and `self.stdout` when `--scriptable` is enabled is a valid and effective solution, although it is not the same as the git diff's approach of using a `log_output` property.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which is helpful for developers to locate the areas that need changes. However, it does not mention the need to handle the `style_func` for `stderr` when `--scriptable` is enabled, which is a minor detail included in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would enable a developer to implement a script-friendly `makemigrations` command, closely matching the git diff's solution. It offers a slightly different but still valid approach to achieve the desired functionality, which is why it receives a score of 9.",
