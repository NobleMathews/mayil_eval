    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the pytest changelog, verifying the implementation of `unittest.TestCase.addCleanup`, and ensuring the correct invocation of `tearDown` and cleanup functions. It also mentions the possibility of a regression in pytest and suggests downgrading or looking for a bug fix. Additionally, it proposes overriding the `run` method or using pytest fixtures as a workaround.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the pytest codebase that modify how the `tearDown` method and cleanup functions are handled, specifically by introducing a new function `maybe_wrap_pytest_function_for_tracing` and altering the `runtest` method in `unittest.py`. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes or similar approaches.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general area of the issue (cleanup functions in pytest) but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide specific code changes or detailed instructions that would help resolve the issue. The suggestion to review the changelog and consider downgrading is only tangentially related to the actual code changes needed.\n\nThe RESPONSE receives a score of 2 because it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
