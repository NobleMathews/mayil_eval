    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions, such as updating the `requests` library, ensuring proper mocking with `requests_mock`, checking the `InvalidLinkBear.get_status_code` method, verifying the handling of the raw stream, and adding a check for `None` before reading from the raw stream. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not directly address the specific problem described in the issue or align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by adding a condition to check if `self.raw` is `None` before attempting to read the content, which is not explicitly suggested in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does mention adding a check to ensure the raw stream is not `None`, but it is suggested as a last resort and not as the primary solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff or the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
