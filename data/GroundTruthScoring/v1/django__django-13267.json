    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows that the solution to the problem is to prevent instantiation of abstract models by raising a TypeError if an abstract model is attempted to be instantiated. The RESPONSE, however, suggests steps to resolve a `TypeError` related to the `ForeignKey` definition and does not mention or address the core issue of preventing instantiation of abstract models. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant steps such as updating the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting, modifying the `ForeignKey` definition, and running migrations, none of which are related to the issue or the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking code snippets that are not part of the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
