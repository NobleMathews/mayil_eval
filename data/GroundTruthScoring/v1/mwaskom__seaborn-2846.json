    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the 'col' parameter is a numpy array and converting it to a format that 'FacetGrid' can understand, or providing a clear error message. It also suggests ensuring that the y-axis label is set based on the provided 'y' parameter. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the 'relplot' function in 'seaborn/relational.py', including handling faceting variables that lack name information by assigning a default name and updating the way axis labels are set using the original variables. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the approach taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a list of code snippets to check, which is not directly actionable and does not provide specific guidance on how to implement the necessary changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
