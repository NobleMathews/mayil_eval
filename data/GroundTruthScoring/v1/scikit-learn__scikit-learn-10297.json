    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the `store_cv_values` parameter is not supported in the `RidgeClassifierCV` class and advises the user to remove it or manually implement cross-validation. However, the git diff indicates that the issue is being resolved by adding support for the `store_cv_values` parameter in the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, including updating the constructor and the documentation to reflect this change. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach to the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. It incorrectly states that the parameter is only relevant for the `RidgeCV` class and advises against using a feature that the git diff is implementing. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue as described.",
