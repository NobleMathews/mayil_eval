    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the base64 encoding of the cookie data and provides a detailed explanation and solution for ensuring that the data is correctly padded to a multiple of 4, which is a requirement for valid base64 data. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix implemented was to catch an additional exception type (`binascii.Error`) in the `_decode` method, rather than altering the encoding process. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure proper padding might be a valid consideration in some contexts, it does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the specific issue described. The RESPONSE does not address the need to catch the `binascii.Error` exception, which is the key element of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the same area of the code but fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's solution.",
