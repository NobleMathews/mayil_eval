    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps that might be taken to allow expressions in `.filter()` calls, which is the goal described in the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to multiple files, including the addition of a method to check if a conditional expression is supported in the WHERE clause, modifications to handle bitwise operations with conditional expressions, and updates to handle expressions in the `build_filter` method of the `Query` class. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests changes to the `F` class to support operations like `.lower()` and a general update to the `build_filter` method without the specific handling of conditional expressions and the necessary checks for database backend support as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the need to handle different database backends or the addition of a `conditional` property to expressions, both of which are key elements in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests implementing method calls like `.lower()` directly on the `F` class, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff instead shows a more comprehensive approach to handling conditional expressions and their compatibility with different database backends.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does provide some relevant information regarding the modification of the `Query` class and the `Expression` objects, it lacks the specific and actionable guidance present in the git diff. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the `F` class and the `resolve_expression` method in the `Query` class does not match the approach taken in the git diff and does not address the issue's requirement for handling expressions in filter calls with the same level of detail and specificity.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. It provides a general direction but misses key elements of the solution required to address the issue effectively.",
