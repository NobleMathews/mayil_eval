    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Bar` admin class to explicitly set `to_field_name` for the `tags` field in `autocomplete_fields`. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue as it attempts to address the incorrect `to_field_name` but does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `autocomplete.py` and `widgets.py` files to fix the issue at its core within the Django framework. The RESPONSE does not provide a solution that would be universally applicable to all instances of the problem, as it only patches the issue for the `Bar` model specifically, rather than fixing the underlying problem in the Django admin code. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it recognizes the need to correct the `to_field_name`, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach of modifying the Django source code to handle inherited models correctly in all cases. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 2.",
