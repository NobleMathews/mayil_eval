    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to receive a score above 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__format__` method to handle sparse arrays by calling `todense` before formatting. This approach is fundamentally different from the git diff, which does not suggest using `todense` at all. Instead, the git diff implements a check for the format specification and raises a `NotImplementedError` if the shape is not a scalar, or uses `self.data.__format__` if it is. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to densify the sparse array could lead to memory issues, which is likely why the git diff avoided this approach. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
