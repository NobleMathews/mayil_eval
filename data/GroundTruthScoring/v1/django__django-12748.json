    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps to implement the feature and includes a sample implementation that is relevant to the issue. It suggests modifying the `sequence_reset_by_name_sql` method in the `sqlite3/operations.py` file to generate SQL statements for resetting sequences in SQLite, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `sqlite_sequence` table.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE is relevant and provides actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the file to be modified (`sqlite3/operations.py`) and the method to be implemented (`sequence_reset_by_name_sql`). The RESPONSE's sample implementation is similar to the git diff in that it involves generating SQL statements to update the `sqlite_sequence` table. However, the RESPONSE's SQL generation logic differs slightly from the git diff's implementation. The git diff provides a more direct and specific SQL statement for resetting the sequences, while the RESPONSE suggests a more generic approach that defaults to the 'id' column and calculates the next sequence value based on the maximum value of the column plus one. This approach may not be as efficient or accurate as the one in the git diff, which directly sets the sequence to zero for the specified tables. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the `supports_sequence_reset` attribute from the `features.py` file, which is part of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance, it does not perfectly align with every aspect of the git diff. A score of 7 is appropriate as it provides a viable alternative to the git diff, but with some differences in the implementation details.",
