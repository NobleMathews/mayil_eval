    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the 'hashed_name' method to ensure that if 'file_hash' is 'None', the filename remains unchanged, which is the same goal as the git diff. The RESPONSE's proposed code change is effectively the same as the git diff, using a ternary operator to assign an empty string to 'file_hash' if it is 'None', and otherwise formatting it with a leading dot. The RESPONSE also includes additional context by providing links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for the developer to understand the broader context of the change. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes a bit more context than the git diff, which is focused solely on the code change without additional repository links. However, this additional context does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE.",
