{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of making `URLField` assume 'https' by default. It suggests updating the `__init__` method to set the default scheme to 'https', removing the deprecation warning, and updating the `to_python` method to use 'https' when no scheme is provided. This aligns well with the git diff, which also introduces changes to the `__init__` method and the `to_python` method. However, the RESPONSE omits the addition of the import statement for `warnings` and `RemovedInDjango60Warning`, which are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests removing the deprecation warning, while the git diff includes adding a deprecation warning to inform users of the upcoming change in the default scheme. Despite these differences, the RESPONSE's core suggestion to change the default scheme to 'https' is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
