    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the cause of the issue as an `OverflowError` due to a very large integer being passed in the URL, which is consistent with the ISSUE description. However, the RESPONSE suggests validating the `user_id` in the URL and updating the URL pattern to restrict the range of valid user IDs, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `IntegerField` class to handle integer overflows and underflows by raising `EmptyResultSet` or `FullResultSet` exceptions. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying any classes or raising exceptions to handle the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `user_change` view function and adding error handling in the view, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
