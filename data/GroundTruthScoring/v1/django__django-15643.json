    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are somewhat relevant to the issue of migrations dropping the explicit primary key when it's altered in SQLite. It suggests reviewing and modifying the `alter_field` method, which is indeed part of the solution as seen in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff's approach. The git diff specifically addresses the condition under which the primary key field should not be unset when an altered field introduces a primary key and is the same field. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a more general approach of deleting and recreating primary key constraints, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific condition check added in the git diff, which is crucial for the fix. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant for understanding the context but does not directly contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a general direction rather than a specific solution.",
