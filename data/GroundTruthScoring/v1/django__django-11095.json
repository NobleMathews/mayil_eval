    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the requested feature of adding a `ModelAdmin.get_inlines()` hook. It correctly suggests defining a new method `get_inlines()` in the `ModelAdmin` class and modifying the `get_inline_instances()` method to use this new hook, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the new method should be called with the appropriate parameters and return the inlines, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_formsets_with_inlines()` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff. This additional step is not necessary for the issue at hand, as the git diff only shows changes to the `get_inline_instances()` method. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it includes an unnecessary step that does not align with the git diff. This deviation prevents the RESPONSE from scoring a perfect 10.",
