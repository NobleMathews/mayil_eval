    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the incorrect usage of the '_overwrite_indexes()' method within the '_combine' method of the 'DataArrayGroupBy' class. It provides a step-by-step approach to resolving the issue, which includes reviewing the usage of '_overwrite_indexes()', ensuring the correct handling of the case when the mapped function returns a 'Dataset', and testing the changes with the user-provided example code.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, which specifically changes the call from '_overwrite_indexes(indexes, coords=index_vars)' to '_overwrite_indexes(indexes, index_vars)'. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to review and correct the usage of '_overwrite_indexes()' is aligned with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the solution might be similar to the one used in issue #6386, which is a reasonable assumption given the context.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change as seen in the git diff, but it does guide the developer towards the problematic part of the code and suggests a viable path to fixing the issue. Therefore, it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution, warranting a score of 7.",
