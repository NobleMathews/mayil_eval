    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach to the issue of disabling loggers from the command line, but it does not align closely with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests using `--logger-disabled` as the command-line option and setting the logging level to `logging.CRITICAL` to disable the loggers. However, the git diff shows that the actual implementation uses `--log-disable` as the option and disables loggers by setting `logger.disabled = True`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the necessary code changes to the `_pytest/logging.py` file, which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes suggestions for bash auto-completion, which is not addressed in the git diff but is relevant to the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
