    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to set the 'allow_distinct' attribute to 'True' for both the 'Avg' and 'Sum' classes in 'django/db/models/aggregates.py' to add DISTINCT support for these aggregates. The RESPONSE also correctly states that the 'Sum' class already has 'allow_distinct = True', which is a slight mistake since the git diff shows that this attribute is being added and was not present before. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also correctly advises not to change the 'Min' and 'Max' classes, as the issue description suggests that it would be pointless. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides example usage of the updated 'Avg' and 'Sum' classes in a Django query, which is helpful for understanding how to use the new feature. The RESPONSE also includes a reminder to update documentation and tests, which is an important part of implementing a new feature. The only minor discrepancy is the incorrect statement about the 'Sum' class, but since it does not affect the implementation of the solution, the RESPONSE still offers high value in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
