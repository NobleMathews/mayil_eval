    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method to the `InlineModelAdmin` class for providing initial data for inline formsets, which is somewhat related to the issue of customizing formset parameters. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of refactoring the existing `_create_formsets` method to use a new `get_formset_kwargs` method. Instead, it proposes a new feature for initial data handling, which is not the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a detailed explanation and code snippets, but these do not match the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses customization of formsets in the admin interface, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
