    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `DummyMiddleware` to handle both synchronous and asynchronous responses, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of the first middleware receiving a coroutine instead of an `HttpResponse`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows changes to the Django middleware classes themselves, not to a user-defined `DummyMiddleware`. The git diff indicates that the core middleware classes are being updated to properly initialize with the `super().__init__(get_response)` call, which is a different approach than modifying user-defined middleware. The RESPONSE does not address the changes in the git diff, such as removing deprecated code and updating the initialization of middleware classes to use `super()`. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is related to middleware handling, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
