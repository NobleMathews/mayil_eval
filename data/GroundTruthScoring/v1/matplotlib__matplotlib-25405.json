    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying and potentially adjusting the calculation of `stride` in the `LogLocator.tick_values` method, which is indeed related to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a precise change in the calculation of `stride` by changing `(numdec + 1) // numticks + 1` to `numdec // numticks + 1`. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or offer an alternative solution that would achieve the same result. Instead, it provides a general review of the method and related conditions without pinpointing the exact change needed. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and therefore does not provide significant value towards fixing the issue.",
