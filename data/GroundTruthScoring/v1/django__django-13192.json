    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to understanding the issue by reviewing the Python security update and modifying the `sanitize_address` function. However, it lacks specific actionable steps that align with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests updating the `forbid_multi_line_headers` function, which is not mentioned in the git diff, and it does not provide a clear solution for handling names longer than 75 characters. The RESPONSE also suggests testing with long names but does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as checking for newlines in address parts and encoding the name differently based on whether it can be ASCII encoded. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of long names in email addresses but fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
