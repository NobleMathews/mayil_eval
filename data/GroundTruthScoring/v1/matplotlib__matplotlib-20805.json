    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the order of the `spines` and `tick_params` calls, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by adding a `rotation` parameter to the `mtext.Text` objects for the labels, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Instead, it suggests a workaround that may not address the underlying problem. The RESPONSE also suggests updating Matplotlib, which is not related to the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the `labelrotation` issue, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff, thus it receives a score of 2.",
