    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general review of the `integrate` function and related components, such as handling of multiple variables and the `atan` function. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which specifically addresses an issue in the `log_to_real` function within `sympy/integrals/rationaltools.py`. The RESPONSE fails to identify the correct location of the issue and does not mention the changes related to handling conjugate roots, which are the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader context of integration issues within SymPy, but it lacks actionable content that would lead to the resolution of the specific issue described. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
