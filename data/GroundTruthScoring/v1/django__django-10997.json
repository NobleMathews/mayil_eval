    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to adding the applied datetime to the `showmigrations` command, which is the core of the issue. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `show_list` function and to display the datetime when the verbosity level is 2 or above. However, the RESPONSE suggests importing the `datetime` module and using a `recorded_migrations` method that does not exist in the git diff. The git diff shows that the applied datetime is already available in the `applied_migration` object and does not require an additional import of the `datetime` module. The RESPONSE also does not mention updating the help text for the `--list` option to reflect the new functionality, which is included in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in terms of the functionality to be added but does not match the implementation details provided in the git diff. Therefore, it offers a partially correct solution but lacks completeness and full relevance to the git diff.",
