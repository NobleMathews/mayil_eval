    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable recommendation to review and correct the `parse_duration` function in `django/utils/dateparse.py`, specifically addressing the issue of the sign being ignored when the ISO string only contains days. It correctly identifies the need to check the multiplication of `days` by `sign` and suggests ensuring that the sign is applied correctly to the `timedelta` object representing days. This aligns closely with the git diff, which adds a condition to multiply `days` by `sign` if the regex match is against the `iso8601_duration_re`. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change but gives a high-level solution that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff. The inclusion of code snippet references is helpful for locating the relevant sections of code, although it is not necessary for the fix itself. The RESPONSE does not directly replicate the git diff but offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result, which is why it receives a high score.",
