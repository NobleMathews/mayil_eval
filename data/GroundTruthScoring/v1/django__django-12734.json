    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new migration file to alter the field `cve_id` in the `Vulnerability` model and to manually alter the `vulnerability_id` field in the `vulnerability_app` table. While this approach could potentially resolve the issue of the unchanged field length in the `vulnerability_app` table, it does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the change within the Django backend's schema alteration logic. The git diff modifies the `_alter_field` method in the `sqlite3` backend to automatically handle related models when a field's type changes, which is a more robust and systemic solution than manually altering fields through migrations. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue of the migration system not detecting precision changes in fields that ManyToMany relationships point to, and instead offers a manual workaround. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a systemic solution to the problem.",
