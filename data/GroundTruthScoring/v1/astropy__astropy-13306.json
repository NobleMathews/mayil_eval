    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `Table` class and `vstack` function can handle structured array data types correctly and modifying the `vstack` function to safely cast structured array data types. It also incorrectly suggests that the `dtype` argument in the user's code snippet is formatted incorrectly, which is not the case according to the issue description. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `dtype` function in `metadata.py` to return `arr_common.dtype.descr` if `arr_common.dtype.names` is not `None`. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed in `metadata.py` and instead focuses on the `vstack` function and the user's code snippet, which are not the root cause of the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses handling structured array data types, which is related to the issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability.",
