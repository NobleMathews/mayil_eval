    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is with the `measure_all` function and provides a detailed explanation and a proposed solution to fix the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was actually with the incorrect usage of the `IntQubit` constructor throughout various functions, including `demo_vgate_app`, `black_box`, `superposition_basis`, and `_represent_ZGate`, and not specifically with the `measure_all` function as suggested by the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed solution focuses on modifying the `measure_all` function and correcting the logarithm base calculation, which is not related to the changes shown in the git diff. The git diff does not show any changes to the `measure_all` function or the logarithm base calculation. Instead, the git diff corrects the way `IntQubit` is instantiated by using named arguments to avoid ambiguity and potential errors.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does mention the `IntQubit` class and its usage, it does not identify the actual problem or provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach to fixing the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not effective in addressing the specific issue described and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff. The score of 2 is given because the RESPONSE does attempt to address the issue of incorrect measurement results, but it fails to identify the correct cause and solution as per the git diff.",
