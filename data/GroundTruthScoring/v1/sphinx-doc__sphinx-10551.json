    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the Sphinx `conf.py` configuration file, reviewing custom templates or theme overrides, ensuring the Sphinx version is up to date, and reporting the issue to the Sphinx project or the PyData Sphinx theme project if it persists. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the `visit_UnaryOp` method in the `ast.py` file to handle the spacing for unary operations differently, specifically for negative numbers (which are instances of `ast.USub`). The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed to fix the issue and instead provides general advice that is not directly related to the code modification shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader context of the issue (rendering in Sphinx), but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
