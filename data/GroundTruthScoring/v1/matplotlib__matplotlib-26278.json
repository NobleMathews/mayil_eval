    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests adding a `set_clip_path` method to the `ContourSet` class and modifying the `__init__` method to accept `clip_path` as a keyword argument, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the `clip_path` parameter to the `__init__` method and the setting of `clip_path` in the `super().__init__` call. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to pop `clip_path` from `kwargs` to prevent warnings about unused kwargs, which is in line with the git diff's approach to handling additional parameters. However, the RESPONSE does not include the documentation changes seen in the git diff, such as the addition of the `clip_path` parameter description and the `.. versionadded:: 3.8` note. While the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, it offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to allow users to clip plots inside a polygon using the `clip_path` keyword. The RESPONSE is actionable and provides clear guidance on how to implement the solution, thus it is scored a 7 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff's approach.",
