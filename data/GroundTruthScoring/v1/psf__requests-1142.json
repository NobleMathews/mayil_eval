    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `prepare_content_length` method to exclude GET requests when setting the 'Content-Length' header, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that shows how to conditionally set the 'Content-Length' header, which is similar to the solution in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it introduces a call to `super_len(body)` and checks for `self.headers.get(\"Content-Length\") is None`, which are not present in the git diff. However, these differences do not detract from the effectiveness of the solution and could be considered additional checks to ensure the correct behavior. The RESPONSE also advises checking the rest of the codebase for other instances where the 'Content-Length' header might be set for GET requests, which is a good practice but not directly addressed in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that would help in resolving the issue, despite minor differences from the git diff.",
