    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the problem and suggests reviewing the usage of the `subs` function within the context of `ConditionSet`, `ImageSet`, and other set-related operations. It also mentions checking the `simultaneous=True` flag and verifying the correct substitution of dummy symbols. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core issue described in the ISSUE. The git diff shows specific changes to the `_eval_subs` method in the `ConditionSet` class, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes a list of code snippets to check, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer, but it does not directly assist in fixing the issue. The RESPONSE does not offer a clear solution or alternative to the git diff, and therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability.",
