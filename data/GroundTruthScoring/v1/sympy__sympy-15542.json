{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests making `Point.distance(Line)` symmetric to `Line.distance(Point)`, which is in line with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the method should calculate the perpendicular distance from the point to the line, which is consistent with the git diff's implementation where `other.distance(self)` is called when `other` is an instance of `Line`. The RESPONSE does not include the additional error handling and type checking present in the git diff, such as raising `AttributeError` or `TypeError` when necessary, but it does provide the core functionality that addresses the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests adding unit tests to verify the new functionality, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it lacks some of the detailed error handling present in the git diff.",
