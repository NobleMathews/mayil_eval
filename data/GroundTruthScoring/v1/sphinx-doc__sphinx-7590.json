    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the regular expression `udl_identifier_re` in `cpp.py` to match user-defined literals (UDLs) and handling the UDLs after numeric literals in the `_parse_literal` function. It also advises checking the Sphinx version for UDL support and updating if necessary.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff as it correctly identifies the need to handle UDLs in the `_parse_literal` function and the regular expression for UDLs. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable changes that match the git diff's approach. The git diff includes extensive modifications to both `cpp.py` and `c.py` files, adding new regular expressions for integer and float literal suffixes, updating the parsing logic for literals, and adding a new class `ASTUserDefinedLiteral` to handle UDLs. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the addition of new classes and methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it touches on the correct file (`cpp.py`) and the correct functionality (UDL handling), but it lacks the detailed and actionable guidance provided by the git diff. Therefore, it does not offer a complete solution to the issue described.",
