{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the steps needed to resolve the issue of supporting callable values in through_defaults. It correctly identifies the need to review and modify the implementation of through_defaults in related_descriptors.py to evaluate callable values before using them. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests the use of a resolve_callables function to handle the evaluation of callable objects within through_defaults, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of the resolve_callables function in django/db/models/utils.py and its usage in related_descriptors.py and query.py.\n\nThe RESPONSE further advises checking the pull request attached to the issue for the proposed fix, which is a good practice for ensuring that the changes align with the expected behavior. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a link to the relevant code snippet, which is helpful for locating the exact location in the codebase that requires modification.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 is that it does not explicitly mention the changes to the update_or_create method in query.py, which is also part of the git diff. However, this is a minor omission, and the RESPONSE is otherwise highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
