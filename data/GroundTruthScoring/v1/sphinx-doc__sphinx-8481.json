    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance to resolve the issue. It suggests modifying the class definition to include docstrings for each slot in a dictionary format and using the `autoclass` directive with the `:special-members:` option, which is not related to the changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows that the actual solution involves modifying the Sphinx extension code to handle `__slots__` attributes correctly by introducing a new `SlotsMixin` class and updating the `AttributeDocumenter` class to use this mixin. Additionally, the `SlotsAttributeDocumenter` class is deprecated, and its functionality is integrated into the `AttributeDocumenter` class. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes and instead provides general advice that does not address the specific issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and receives a score of 0.",
