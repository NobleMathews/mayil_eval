    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_inlines` method and overriding the `changeform_view` method in `ParentAdmin` to handle the dynamic addition of inlines based on the object's state. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `_changeform_view` method to create formsets before validating the form, ensuring that the inlines are correctly initialized when the object is saved.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff, which involves moving the creation of formsets to occur before the form validation. Instead, it suggests adding extra context and handling inline formsets in a different manner, which could potentially solve the issue but is not the approach taken in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that the JavaScript responsible for initializing the formsets is triggered when the `show_inlines` field changes. This is a valid point but is not reflected in the git diff, which focuses on the server-side changes. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear implementation for this JavaScript change, making it less actionable.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff, but it does not match the specific changes made in the git diff and lacks complete relevance and actionability.",
