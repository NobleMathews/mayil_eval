    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests checking if the `Spines` class has a `__deepcopy__` method and, if not, to implement it or override it with a more informative error message. This aligns well with the git diff, which changes the error type from `ValueError` to `AttributeError` when a non-existent attribute is accessed on a `Spines` object. The RESPONSE's suggestion to implement or override `__deepcopy__` is a valid alternative approach to the problem, as it directly addresses the root cause of the issue, which is the handling of the `__deepcopy__` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for proper attribute handling and memoization to avoid recursion issues, which is a critical aspect of implementing `__deepcopy__`. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance by suggesting testing with the provided code snippet to ensure the issue is resolved. However, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest changing the error type as the git diff does, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE also includes links to various code snippets that may not be directly relevant to the fix but could provide context, which does not detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
