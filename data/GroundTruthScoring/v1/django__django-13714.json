    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a solution to the specific issue described. The git diff shows a change in the way the JSON support check is performed within the SQLite backend features of Django, specifically by modifying the exception handling and transaction block. The RESPONSE, however, suggests changing the database backend or handling JSON data manually, which does not address the misleading error message issue described in the ISSUE. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the solution in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
