    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance to address the issue described. It explains why 'oo - oo' results in 'nan' from a mathematical perspective, but it does not offer any solution or guidance that aligns with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__div__` methods in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file, which involve checking the `global_evaluate[0]` flag before returning `NotImplemented` or proceeding with the operation. The RESPONSE fails to mention or address the changes in the git diff, such as the addition of `and global_evaluate[0]` conditions and the replacement of `return NotImplemented` with calls to `Number.__add__`, `Number.__sub__`, `Number.__mul__`, and `Number.__div__`. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not help the developer fix the issue and is not aligned with the git diff.",
