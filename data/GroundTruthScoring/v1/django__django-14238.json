    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'MyBigAutoField' class to include a metaclass and updating the '_subclasses' tuple in the 'AutoFieldMeta' metaclass. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix was to change the '__subclasscheck__' method in the 'AutoFieldMeta' class to use 'issubclass(subclass, self._subclasses)' instead of 'subclass in self._subclasses'. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the subclass checking mechanism, it does not provide the correct actionable guidance based on the git diff. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the 'MyBigAutoField' class and update the '_subclasses' tuple is not supported by the git diff and would not resolve the issue as effectively as the change shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a low score for its partial relevance but lack of alignment with the git diff.",
