    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue by suggesting the addition of a `__version_info__` attribute and the use of a `_parse_to_version_info` function to parse `__version__`. This aligns well with the git diff, which introduces a `_VersionInfo` namedtuple and a `_parse_to_version_info` function to parse the version string into a comparable format. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to add `__version_info__` to the `__all__` list, making it part of the public API, which is in line with the git diff's approach to making `__version_info__` accessible.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the detailed implementation of the `_parse_to_version_info` function or the modifications to the `__getattr__` function that are present in the git diff. While the RESPONSE does not need to match the git diff exactly, the lack of these details means it does not fully capture the complexity of the changes made in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `__version__` definition directly, which is not part of the git diff's approach. The git diff instead uses a separate `_get_version` function to determine the version string.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that is closely aligned with the git diff, but it is not complete in capturing all the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
