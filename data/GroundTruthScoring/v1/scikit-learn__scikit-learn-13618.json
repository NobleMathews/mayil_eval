    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the changes needed to implement the feature of setting initial hyperparameters (alpha, lambda) in the `BayesianRidge` model, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the `BayesianRidge` class to accept new parameters `alpha_init` and `lambda_init` in its constructor and using these initial values in the `fit` method. This approach is aligned with the git diff, which also introduces `alpha_init` and `lambda_init` parameters and uses them in the `fit` method.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact changes to the code as shown in the git diff, such as the specific lines to be modified or the exact implementation details. It also does not mention the changes to the documentation and the example script that are part of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers some actionable advice, it is incomplete and does not match the git diff in full detail.",
