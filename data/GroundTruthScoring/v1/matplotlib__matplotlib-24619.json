    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the data type of the color array and scaling it to the range [0, 1] if it is of type `uint8` or any integer type. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, which involves handling integer color values correctly in the `pcolorfast` function. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which does not include any checks or scaling based on the data type. Instead, the git diff modifies the handling of the color array `C` by allowing it to remain multidimensional for RGB(A) data and updates the documentation to reflect the supported array shapes for the mesh data. The RESPONSE's suggestion to scale the color values is not reflected in the git diff, and the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the handling of the `C` array in the `pcolorfast` function or the updates to the documentation. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
