    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'corr' function in 'xarray.core.computation.py' to include a check for whether 'dask' is installed and to handle the case when it is not. It also suggests adding a conditional import for 'dask' and a check using 'dask_available' before calling '_cov_corr'. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the 'corr' function or suggest implementing a fallback method using NumPy. Instead, the git diff focuses on ensuring consistent return dtype in the '_get_valid_values' function and refactoring the 'is_dask_collection' function in 'xarray.core.parallel.py' and 'xarray.core.pycompat.py'. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff and instead proposes an alternative solution that is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of 'dask' not being defined, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
