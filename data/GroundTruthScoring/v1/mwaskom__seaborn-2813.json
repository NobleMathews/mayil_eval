    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the `binrange` parameter, ensuring `binwidth` is set correctly, verifying data integrity, considering a smaller `binwidth`, rounding data, and reporting the issue to Seaborn developers if unresolved. These suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of a data point being omitted in the histogram, but they do not align with the git diff provided.\n\nThe git diff shows a change in the `_define_bin_edges` function to handle roundoff error by appending an additional bin edge if necessary. This directly addresses the issue of the data point 2.6 being omitted due to roundoff error. The RESPONSE does not mention or address roundoff errors or suggest modifying the bin edges calculation, which is the core of the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff changes. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant by discussing histogram parameters and potential floating-point precision issues, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
