    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `Line2D` constructor and the `recache` method to ensure that input arrays are copied and the cache is invalidated when the data is changed. This aligns with the git diff's approach of copying the input arrays to prevent in-place modifications from affecting the drawn line. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the constructor to copy the data, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff specifically adds a `__copy__` method to the `TaggedValue` class and modifies the `set_xdata` and `set_ydata` methods to copy the data, rather than changing the constructor. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a review of the `recache` method and other methods that might affect the data, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff and provides some useful guidance, but it does not match the git diff's approach entirely.",
