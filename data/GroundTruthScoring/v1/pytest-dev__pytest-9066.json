    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described, which is to show the full qualified name on direct Node construction warning. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `pytest-relaxed` plugin to use `from_parent` method, which is unrelated to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippets and does not provide any actionable guidance that would help in resolving the issue. Therefore, it does not offer any value in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
