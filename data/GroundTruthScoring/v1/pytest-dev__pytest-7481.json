    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `TerminalWriter` class to handle encoding errors gracefully, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use 'utf-8' with 'replace' error handling does not align with the git diff's approach of using 'unicode-escape' to encode the message. The git diff's solution is to catch the `UnicodeEncodeError` and then encode the message to ASCII using 'unicode-escape', which is a different approach than the RESPONSE's suggestion of using 'utf-8' with 'replace'. The RESPONSE's alternative is not as effective because it does not consider environments that may not support UTF-8 encoding, which is a concern explicitly mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a reference to a code snippet that is not relevant to the actual fix needed for the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide an effective alternative solution.",
