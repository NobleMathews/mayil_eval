    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement support for the `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR` environment variables, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE outlines the steps to add checks for these variables and modify the output logic accordingly, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also includes pseudo-code that demonstrates how to implement the feature, which is helpful and actionable. However, the RESPONSE does not directly reference the specific file and method (`should_do_markup` in `terminalwriter.py`) where the changes need to be made, as shown in the git diff. Instead, it provides a general approach and mentions the need to locate the relevant part of the codebase. This lack of specificity in identifying the exact location for the changes results in a score of 7, as it is not a perfect match with the git diff but still offers a viable and effective solution to the issue.",
