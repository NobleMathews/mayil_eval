    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the 'durable' flag in the `Atomic` class and the `atomic` function, which is exactly what the issue describes. The RESPONSE's suggested changes to the `Atomic` class's `__init__` method, the `__enter__` method, and the `atomic` function are in line with the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to raise a `RuntimeError` if a durable atomic block is nested within another atomic block, which matches the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation and adding unit tests, which, while not explicitly shown in the git diff, are best practices that would be expected for such a change. The RESPONSE does not mention the private flag `_ensure_durability` introduced in the git diff, which is used to disable durability checks in `TestCase`. This omission is the only reason the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10, as it overlooks a detail that is part of the git diff's solution. However, the RESPONSE still provides a highly relevant and actionable solution that would effectively resolve the issue.",
