    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `BaseConstraint` class to allow passing a custom `violation_error_code` when raising a `ValidationError`. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating any subclasses of `BaseConstraint` that override the `validate` method to ensure they use the new `violation_error_code` attribute. The provided code snippet demonstrates the changes needed in the `BaseConstraint` class and an example subclass, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not provide the exact code changes line by line. However, it does offer a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result as the git diff, which is to allow customization of the `violation_error_code` in `ValidationError` raised by `BaseConstraint.validate`. The RESPONSE also correctly points out the need to update documentation and add tests, which is a necessary part of implementing new features but not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE could have been more complete by including the changes to the `__init__` method signatures and the `deconstruct` method, which are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE could have mentioned the need to update the `__repr__` and `__eq__` methods to include the new `violation_error_code` attribute, as shown in the git diff. These omissions prevent the RESPONSE from scoring a perfect 10.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a highly relevant solution that would assist the developer in implementing the requested feature, with minor omissions that do not significantly detract from its utility.",
