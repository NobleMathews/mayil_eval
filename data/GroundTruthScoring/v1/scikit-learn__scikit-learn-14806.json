    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new parameter `force_iterimpute` to the `IterativeImputer` class to control the imputation behavior, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a different parameter `skip_complete` to address the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `transform` method and update the `_initial_imputation` method to store information about which features had missing values during `fit` is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff instead modifies the `_impute_one_feature` and `_get_ordered_idx` methods to handle the new behavior. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section with code snippets to check, which is not actionable in the context of fixing the issue and does not provide direct guidance on implementing the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
