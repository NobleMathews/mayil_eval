    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the pytest dependency to version 6.2.3 or later, which is not directly related to the code changes in the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the directory creation functions to use private permissions (mode 0o700) and error handling for directory ownership, which the RESPONSE does address by suggesting to ensure that directories are created with private permissions and to implement error handling for pre-existing directories.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific code changes. The git diff modifies existing functions and adds permission checks within the context of the pytest codebase, while the RESPONSE suggests creating a new function for directory creation and ownership checking, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes an assertion to check the pytest version, which is not part of the git diff and does not contribute to resolving the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of directory permissions and ownership, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
