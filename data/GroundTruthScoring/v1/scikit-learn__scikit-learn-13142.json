    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring the use of a `random_state` parameter and modifying the unit test to include cases where `n_init` is greater than 1. While these suggestions are generally good practices for ensuring reproducibility and thorough testing, they do not directly address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is about the inconsistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` methods when `n_init` is greater than 1. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves moving the final e-step in the `fit_predict` method to ensure consistent labels, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, it does touch on the importance of reproducibility and testing, which are somewhat relevant to the issue, hence a score of 2 is appropriate.",
