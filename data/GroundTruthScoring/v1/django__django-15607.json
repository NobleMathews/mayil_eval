    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `LogoutView` class to handle the redirection logic in the `post` method, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff modifies the `get_next_page` method to check for `settings.LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` and use it if the `next` parameter is unsafe. While the RESPONSE does not match the git diff, it does offer a solution that could potentially resolve the issue by ensuring that unsafe `next` parameters are ignored and `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` is used instead.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the issue of the intermediary redirect, which is the core problem described in the issue. The git diff provides a direct solution to this problem by modifying the `get_next_page` method to avoid the unnecessary redirect. The RESPONSE, while it may prevent unsafe redirects, does not explicitly remove the intermediary redirect, which is a key aspect of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the safety of the `next` parameter and the use of `LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`, but it does not fully align with the git diff's approach to removing the unnecessary intermediary redirect. Therefore, it is scored as a 4, indicating that it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
