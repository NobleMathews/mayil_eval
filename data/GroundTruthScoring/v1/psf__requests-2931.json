    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of investigative steps that could help identify the root cause of the issue, such as checking for changes between versions and ensuring that the `data` parameter is handled correctly. It also suggests looking into the `to_native_string` function, which is relevant to the issue as the git diff shows changes made to this function's usage. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or directly address the changes shown in the git diff, such as removing the call to `to_native_string` for instances of `str` or `bytes` and adding a condition to convert `params` to a native string before encoding. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it identifies the potential problematic function but does not offer the precise changes needed to fix the issue. Therefore, it is only partially relevant and actionable.",
