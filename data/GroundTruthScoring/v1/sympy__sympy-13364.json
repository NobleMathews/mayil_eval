    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'Pow' class in 'sympy/core/power.py' to handle the ternary 'pow()' operation, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. The git diff shows that the changes are made in 'sympy/core/expr.py' rather than 'sympy/core/power.py', and it introduces a new method '_pow' to handle the binary power operation separately from the ternary power operation. The RESPONSE does not mention creating a separate method for binary power or handling the ternary operation within the '__pow__' method as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the use of 'as_int' for argument validation or the handling of negative exponents with 'mod_inverse', both of which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the ternary power operation, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
