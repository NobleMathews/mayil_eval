    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement rate-limiting for the autocomplete widget's Ajax requests in Django, which is the issue described. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the `build_attrs` method in `widgets.py` and to add the `data-ajax--delay` attribute with a value of 250 milliseconds, which matches the git diff solution. The RESPONSE also includes additional context and guidance on testing the changes and ensuring that the feature works as expected, which is valuable for developers. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes additional information about checking the `autocomplete.js` file and other related code snippets, which, while potentially useful, are not part of the git diff solution. However, this additional information does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
