{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of why 'categorical_crossentropy' is not suitable for binary classification and suggests that a ValueError should be raised when this loss function is used inappropriately. This aligns well with the git diff, which adds a check to raise a ValueError if 'categorical_crossentropy' is used for binary classification. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the '_parameter_constraints' dictionary and implementing a check in the 'fit' method, which is a reasonable alternative to the git diff's approach of adding the check in the '_get_loss' method. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation location but achieves the same goal of preventing misuse of the loss function. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet for the 'fit' method, which is not present in the git diff but is a valid alternative solution. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the 'n_trees_per_iteration_' condition, which is a key part of the git diff's added check, hence the score is not a perfect 10.",
