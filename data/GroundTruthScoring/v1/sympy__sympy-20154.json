{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the `partitions()` function in `sympy.utilities.iterables`, which is the reuse of the same dictionary object for each yield. The RESPONSE suggests copying the dictionary before yielding it, which aligns with the git diff's solution to the problem. The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that would resolve the issue, and it includes a pseudo code snippet that effectively communicates the necessary change. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that the RESPONSE uses 'q.copy()' in the pseudo code snippet, which does not directly correspond to the actual variable names used in the git diff ('ms.copy()'). However, this is a minor discrepancy and does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
