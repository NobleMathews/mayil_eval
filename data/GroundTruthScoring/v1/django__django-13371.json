    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in the `NamedValuesListIterable` class and ensuring that the `create_namedtuple_class` function returns a namedtuple class with the necessary pickling support. It also suggests creating a subclass of `namedtuple` if modification is not possible and updating the `cacheops` package if it is responsible for pickling.\n\nThe git diff, however, shows that the solution involves moving the `create_namedtuple_class` function to `utils.py` and decorating it with `functools.lru_cache()`. It also adds a `__reduce__` method to the namedtuple class returned by `create_namedtuple_class` to support pickling.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `create_namedtuple_class` function and adding a `__reduce__` method. Instead, it suggests implementing `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of making `Row` instances pickleable, but it does not provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff's solution.",
