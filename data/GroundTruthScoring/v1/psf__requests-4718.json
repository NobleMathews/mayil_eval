    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code modifications that align closely with the git diff. It suggests modifying the 'should_strip_auth' method to ensure the 'Authorization' header is stripped when redirecting from 'https' to 'http', which is consistent with the git diff's addition of the 'should_strip_auth' method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the 'rebuild_auth' method should call 'should_strip_auth' and strip the 'Authorization' header if the method returns 'True', which matches the changes in the git diff where the 'rebuild_auth' method is updated to use 'should_strip_auth'.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by providing a code snippet for the 'should_strip_auth' method, which includes logic for stripping the 'Authorization' header when the scheme changes from 'https' to 'http'. This is in line with the git diff's logic, although the RESPONSE's code snippet includes additional logic for handling default ports that is not present in the git diff. This additional logic does not detract from the RESPONSE's utility, as it still achieves the same goal of ensuring the 'Authorization' header is not sent over an unencrypted connection.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the special case handling for 'http' to 'https' redirects on standard ports that is present in the git diff. This special case is important for maintaining backward compatibility, as mentioned in the git diff, and its absence in the RESPONSE could potentially lead to a regression in behavior. However, the RESPONSE is still highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, hence the score of 9.",
