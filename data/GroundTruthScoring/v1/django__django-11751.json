    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to proceed with making security headers default in Django, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It correctly identifies the need to update `global_settings.py` to set `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` to 'DENY', which aligns with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE also suggests updating settings that are not part of the git diff, such as `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF` and `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`, and it does not mention the changes to `django/core/checks/security/base.py` and `django/middleware/clickjacking.py` that are included in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to update the `startproject` template settings and to enable `django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware` by default, which are not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete in terms of matching the git diff.",
