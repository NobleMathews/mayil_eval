    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `_wilds` method in the `Bernoulli` class to ensure that the `n` Wild symbol excludes `x`, `f(x)`, and `f(x).diff(x)`, which is in line with the git diff that modifies the `exclude` parameter for the `n` Wild symbol to include `x`, `f(x)`, and `df`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to exclude additional terms to prevent misclassification of the ODE, which is the core issue described.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE refers to the `Bernoulli` class in `single.py`, while the git diff shows changes in `ode.py`. This discrepancy could lead to confusion, as the developer might look in the wrong file or class for the code to modify. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff, which could be seen as providing extra information that is not strictly necessary to resolve the issue but does not detract from the main solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets and suggests testing the `dsolve` function after making the change, which is a good practice but not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but provides a viable alternative approach to the issue that would likely resolve the problem if implemented correctly.",
