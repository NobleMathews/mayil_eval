    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of raising a descriptive error when filtering by window expressions. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `Window` expression is not used directly within the `filter` method and to use `annotate` instead, which is not relevant to the issue of error handling. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the database backend for support of window functions, which is not related to the code changes required to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does reference the `check_filterable` method, which is part of the solution in the git diff, but it does not provide any actionable advice on how to modify or use this method to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 1.",
