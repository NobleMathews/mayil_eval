    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code snippets on how to allow overriding FormSet's error messages for too few and too many forms, which is the core issue. It suggests modifying the `BaseFormSet` class to include a `default_error_messages` dictionary and updating the `clean` method to use these messages, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding error messages to `default_error_messages` and using them in `full_clean`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to allow passing an `error_messages` argument to the `BaseFormSet` initializer to override the defaults, which is in line with the git diff's intention to enable message overriding.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not use the `ngettext_lazy` function for the error messages as the git diff does, which is important for proper localization and pluralization support. Instead, it uses static strings for the error messages and a custom `get_error_message` method, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section on overriding via `inlineformset_factory`, which is not addressed in the git diff and is mentioned in the issue as a separate concern for another day. This part of the RESPONSE, while informative, is not directly relevant to the immediate issue and git diff provided.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not match every aspect of the git diff's approach, particularly the use of `ngettext_lazy` and the absence of a custom message retrieval method. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
