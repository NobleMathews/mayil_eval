    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `_print_sign` method in the `sympy/printing/fcode.py` file, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the problem with the Fortran code generation for the `sp.sign` function and proposes a solution that would generate valid Fortran syntax. However, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff provided. The git diff includes additional logic to handle cases when the argument is zero, both for integer and non-integer types, using the `merge` function in Fortran. The RESPONSE's solution does not account for the zero case and uses `isign` and `dsign` directly without the `merge` function. This omission means that the RESPONSE's solution would not handle the `x=0` case as the git diff intends to. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the issue described.",
