    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of the createsuperuser command not validating usernames with a UniqueConstraint. It suggests modifying the command to include a check for the uniqueness of the custom_username and raising a CommandError if the username already exists. This approach is relevant and would effectively prevent the IntegrityError described in the ISSUE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly align with the git diff, which introduces a cached_property to determine if the username is unique by checking both the unique attribute and the total_unique_constraints of the UserModel. However, the RESPONSE's alternative solution of querying the CustomUser model to check for the existence of the custom_username is a valid and effective approach to solving the problem.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to perform this check in both interactive and non-interactive modes of the createsuperuser command, which is an important consideration for the functionality of the command.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not score higher because it does not include the implementation of the cached_property or the consideration of unique constraints in the UserModel's meta options, which are part of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE assumes the use of CustomUser directly in the createsuperuser command, which may not be generalizable for all custom user models and does not leverage the existing UserModel abstraction as the git diff does.",
