    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating the doctest failure and reviewing the docstring for accuracy, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff indicates that changes were made to the internal caching mechanism of the `ReferenceFrame` class and the simplification of the `dcm` method output. The RESPONSE fails to address these specific changes and instead suggests a general review of the docstring and simplification process. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly advises to ignore the provided code snippets, which are actually crucial to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and lacks the necessary detail to assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
