    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of why `force_all_finite=True` is used in `check_array` and suggests that if the underlying model can handle `NaN` or `inf` values, one could subclass `SelectFromModel` and override the `transform` method to change the `force_all_finite` parameter. This is actionable advice and aligns with the git diff's intent to handle `NaN` and `inf` values based on the underlying estimator's capabilities.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation. The git diff shows changes in multiple files, indicating that the handling of `NaN` and `inf` values is being addressed not just in `SelectFromModel`, but also in other feature selection classes like `VarianceThreshold`, `RFE`, and `RFECV`. The RESPONSE focuses only on `SelectFromModel` and does not mention the addition of `_more_tags` methods or the use of the `_get_tags` method to dynamically determine the `force_all_finite` value, which are key elements in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is not directly related to the git diff changes and does not reflect the nuanced approach taken in the git diff, which uses tags to determine the appropriate behavior for `force_all_finite`. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track in terms of allowing flexibility for handling `NaN` and `inf` values, it does not fully capture the scope or the specific changes made in the git diff.",
