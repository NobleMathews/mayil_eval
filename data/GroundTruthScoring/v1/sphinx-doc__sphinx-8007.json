    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying a non-existent `TypeAliasForwardRef` class and adding a configuration option `autodoc_unfold_aliases` in the Sphinx configuration file. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution involves modifying the `inspect.signature` function calls to include a new `type_aliases` parameter, which is then used to prevent the unfolding of type aliases. Additionally, a new configuration option `autodoc_type_aliases` is added to the Sphinx setup function. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, it does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue.",
