    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `to_python` method in the custom path converter to raise `ValueError` instead of `Http404` and to ensure that the URL resolver handles `ValueError` appropriately. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which changes the exception handling in the `technical_404_response` function from catching `Resolver404` to `Http404`. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed in the Django framework to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. Instead, it suggests a workaround that might be implemented in user code, which does not resolve the core issue within Django itself. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it discusses exception handling in the context of path converters, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
