{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_clone_parametrized' function in 'sklearn/base.py' to handle the case when an estimator class is passed instead of an instance. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the 'clone' function to handle estimator types (classes) by adding a check for 'isinstance(estimator, type)'. The RESPONSE's suggestion to instantiate the class before calling 'get_params' is a valid alternative approach to the issue, ensuring that the 'clone' function can handle classes as well as instances. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, as it suggests adding a new function '_clone_parametrized', which is not present in the git diff. However, the core idea of checking if the estimator is a class and handling it accordingly is effectively the same. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers actionable advice that would resolve the issue described. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it introduces a new function name that is not present in the git diff, but this does not detract from the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",
