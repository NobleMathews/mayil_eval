    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `solvify` function in the `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` file to handle `ConditionSet` differently. However, the git diff provided shows changes made to the `_eval_as_set` method in the `sympy/core/relational.py` file, where a try-except block is added to handle `NotImplementedError` by returning a `ConditionSet`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests changes to a different file and function than the one actually modified in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative approach to the issue described, as it does not address the specific problem of `solveset` raising `NotImplementedError` instead of returning `ConditionSet`. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
