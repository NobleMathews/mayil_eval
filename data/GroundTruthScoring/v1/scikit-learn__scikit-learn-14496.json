    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff, offering clear guidance on how to fix the issue. It suggests modifying the compute_optics_graph function to ensure min_samples is an integer before it is used as the n_neighbors parameter in the NearestNeighbors class. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to convert min_samples to an integer and suggests using the round function followed by int conversion, which is similar to the git diff's approach of using int conversion without rounding.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in the following ways:\n\n1. It correctly identifies the file and function where the issue occurs (compute_optics_graph in sklearn/cluster/optics_.py).\n2. It suggests converting min_samples to an integer after it is potentially assigned a float value, which is consistent with the git diff's changes.\n3. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use rounding before converting to an integer is a reasonable alternative to the git diff's direct integer conversion. This alternative approach is not penalized as it achieves the same result of ensuring min_samples is an integer.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff in that it suggests using the round function, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix and could potentially distract from the main issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its close alignment with the git diff and its clear, actionable guidance, with a minor deduction for the additional rounding step and inclusion of unnecessary links.",
