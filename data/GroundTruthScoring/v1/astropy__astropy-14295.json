{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 4 indicates that the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `_fix_scamp` function from `astropy/wcs/wcs.py`, which aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue of SIP keywords leading to ignored PV keywords. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `_fix_pre2012_scamp_tpv` function or the modifications to the `_fix_scamp` function that are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also does not address the specific changes to the warning messages and the logic for handling the presence of '-TPV' in the CTYPE, which are key elements of the git diff. While the RESPONSE does provide some actionable steps, such as removing the `_fix_scamp` function and updating documentation, it fails to capture the full extent of the changes needed as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue at hand.",
