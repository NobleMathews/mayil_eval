    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to review the `memcache_key_warnings` function and replace the format string. It also provides a corrected version of the function, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of simply removing the `CacheKeyWarning` from the `yield` statement. Instead, it suggests additional changes to the function that are not present in the git diff, such as handling the `MEMCACHE_MAX_KEY_LENGTH` and using a different format method for the `key` variable. While these suggestions may improve the function, they do not directly address the specific issue described, which is the bad format string causing an exception. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the function in question, but this does not compensate for the deviation from the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue.",
