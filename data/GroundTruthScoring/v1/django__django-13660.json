    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/shell.py` to pass an empty dictionary as the global namespace to the `exec` function. This is highly relevant to the issue, which is about the shell command crashing when passing Python code with functions using the `-c` option. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use an empty dictionary aligns with the git diff's approach of providing a dictionary for the global namespace, although the git diff uses `globals()` instead of an empty dictionary. The RESPONSE's solution is a valid alternative to the git diff and would likely resolve the issue. However, it does not match the git diff exactly, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE also provides a reference to the code snippets where the issue is present and where a correct usage of `exec` can be found, which is helpful for the developer.",
