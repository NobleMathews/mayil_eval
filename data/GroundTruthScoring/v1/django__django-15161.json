{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to update the `deconstruct` method for Django model expressions to use a simplified path, which is exactly what the issue describes. It correctly identifies the need to update the `@deconstructible` decorator for each class and provides accurate examples of how to do so. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating migration files and adding tests to verify the changes, which are good practices though not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, as it includes an unnecessary example for the `F` class, which is already using the simplified path, and it does not provide the exact changes made in the git diff. However, it offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result as the git diff, which is to simplify the paths for the deconstruction of expressions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 9.",
