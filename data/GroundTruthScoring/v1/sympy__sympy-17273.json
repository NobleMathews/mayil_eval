    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `_as_mpf_val` method in the `HBar` class within `sympy/physics/quantum/constants.py` to correct the value of `hbar`. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the `HBar` class or the file `constants.py`. Instead, the git diff updates the value of `hbar` in `sympy/physics/units/definitions.py` by setting its scale factor based on the updated Planck constant value. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the other changes made in the git diff, such as adding the `elementary_charge` and updating various constants to their latest values according to NIST SP 959 (June 2019). Therefore, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative to the changes required to fix the issue.",
