    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the LaTeX template and ensuring that the LaTeX package handling footnotes is correctly configured. It also recommends verifying the Sphinx LaTeX writer's translation of RST footnote syntax to LaTeX commands and reporting the issue to the Sphinx GitHub repository if it persists. Additionally, it provides a temporary workaround of manually editing the generated `.tex` file.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by removing the conditional check for 'referred' in the `visit_footnote` and `visit_footnotetext` methods and the associated LaTeX commands that were causing the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `sphinx/writers/latex.py` file or the specific changes made in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on general troubleshooting steps and reviewing other parts of the codebase that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general area of footnotes in LaTeX and Sphinx, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
