    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that partially aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests updating the `RisingFactorial` function to handle the case when `x` is a negative integer and `k` is non-integer by returning `S.Zero`. This matches the git diff's addition of a condition to return `S.Zero` when `k` is not an integer and `x` is a negative integer. However, the RESPONSE also includes suggestions that are not supported by the git diff, such as adding `asech` to the `evalf_table` in `sympy` and ensuring that `mpmath` library handles division by zero appropriately. These additional suggestions do not align with the git diff and are not directly related to the issue described, which is specifically about the automatic evaluation of `RisingFactorial(n, k)` with `n` being a negative integer and `k` being non-integer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in terms of addressing the issue as presented in the git diff.",
