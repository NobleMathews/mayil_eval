    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `describe_operation` method in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` to include a check for no-op operations and append a comment indicating no SQL to execute. However, the git diff provided shows that the changes should be made in the `apply` and `unapply` methods of the `Migration` class in `django/db/migrations/migration.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE's approach is not effective because it targets a different file and method than what is required to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The score is not 0 because the RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to add a comment for no-op operations, which is a minor part of the issue, but the approach and location of the changes are incorrect.",
