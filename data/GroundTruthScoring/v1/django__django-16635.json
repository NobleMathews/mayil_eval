    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is relevant to the issue of incorrect operation order in a Django migration file. It correctly suggests that the 'AddField' operation for the 'category' field should be placed before the 'AddConstraint' operation. This advice aligns with the general principle of ensuring that fields exist before constraints that reference them are added, which is a necessary step to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff introduces a method '_get_dependencies_for_model' and adds 'dependencies' to the 'add_operation' calls within 'generate_added_indexes' and 'generate_added_constraints' methods. This suggests that the underlying issue is being addressed by ensuring that the migration operations have the correct dependencies, rather than simply reordering the operations in the migration file as the RESPONSE suggests.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a suggestion to review code snippets from 'autodetector.py' and 'base.py', which is somewhat relevant but does not directly address the issue or the solution provided in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE refers to 'NewModel', which is not mentioned in the git diff or the issue description, indicating a slight misalignment with the context.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a partial solution by advising the reordering of operations, which is a step in the right direction but does not capture the full solution involving dependencies as shown in the git diff. Therefore, it is scored as partially relevant and incomplete.",
