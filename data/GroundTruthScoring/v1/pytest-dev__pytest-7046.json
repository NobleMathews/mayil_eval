    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the expected behavior of pytest's `-k` option and provides a suggestion to use a more specific expression to match the test function name. However, it does not address the underlying issue that the pytest's keyword matching is including directory names in its search, which is the core problem described in the ISSUE. The git diff shows that changes were made to the pytest code to handle the matching differently, specifically by modifying the `from_item` method in `__init__.py` to exclude `pytest.Session` from the mapped names and changing the `name` attribute in `python.py` to use the basename of the directory. The RESPONSE does not offer any actionable advice that aligns with these changes or provides an alternative solution to modify the pytest code. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the `-k` option behavior but lacks actionable content to resolve the issue as described and does not match the git diff.",
