    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to add an __iter__ method to the Paginator class in the `django/core/paginator.py` file and provides the exact Python code that should be added, which matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes additional helpful advice, such as testing the new feature and updating the documentation, which, while not part of the git diff, are relevant and useful for a complete implementation. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff or the issue description. However, these links do not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
