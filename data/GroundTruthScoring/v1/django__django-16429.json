{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the location of the issue within the `timesince` function and provides a solution that aligns with the git diff by suggesting the inclusion of the `tzinfo` argument from the `d` datetime object. It also correctly advises ensuring that the `now` datetime object is timezone-aware, which is relevant to the issue but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE further suggests testing the changes with the provided test case, which is a good practice for confirming the fix. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes additional instructions about making `now` timezone-aware using `timezone.make_aware`, which is not part of the git diff. However, this does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as it is still relevant and could be considered good practice when dealing with timezone issues in Django.",
