    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to handle the `exp` function within the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, which is relevant to the issue described. It suggests checking if the `exp` function's argument is dimensionless and handling predefined mathematical functions by checking the dimensions of their arguments. This aligns with the git diff's intent to fix the dimension handling in mathematical functions.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff, which is the modification of the return statement to correctly combine the dimensions using the unpacking operator `*`. Instead, it provides a more general approach to handling dimensionless functions and ensuring that the arguments have matching dimensions. While this advice is useful, it does not reflect the precise change needed as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which could be helpful for a developer looking to understand the context of the issue. However, these snippets do not directly contribute to resolving the issue at hand, and the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement the fix in the code, unlike the git diff which shows the exact line to be changed.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 4 as it offers some actionable advice and is partially relevant but does not closely match the git diff or provide a complete solution.",
