    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating SymPy, using `trigsimp()` instead of `simplify()`, applying specific trigonometric simplification strategies, or manually applying trigonometric identities. While these suggestions could be helpful in a general context, they do not align with the git diff provided, which shows specific changes to the `fu.py` file in the SymPy library. The git diff indicates that the issue is resolved by modifying the code within the `fu.py` file, specifically by removing an unnecessary list initialization and altering the way certain expressions are handled in the code. The RESPONSE does not address the need to change the code as per the git diff, and instead offers general troubleshooting steps that are not directly related to the code changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader topic of simplifying trigonometric expressions but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
