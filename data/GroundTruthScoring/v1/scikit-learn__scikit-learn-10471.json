    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the data passed to KMeans is C-contiguous by using `numpy.ascontiguousarray` to convert `X` to C-contiguous format if necessary. This advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about optimizing KMeans for array C/F contiguity. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff, which includes several changes to the KMeans implementation in scikit-learn to handle data contiguity more efficiently. The git diff modifies the `k_means` function and the `KMeans` class to handle the order of the array based on the `copy_x` parameter and adds a check to ensure that the number of samples is larger than the number of clusters. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the importance of the `copy_x` parameter. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the issue.",
