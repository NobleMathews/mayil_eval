    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `MigrationOptimizer` logic and the `_sort_migrations` method in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, as well as ensuring that the `MigrationOptimizer` is not case-sensitive. It also recommends adding a unit test to cover the scenario. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix was made in `django/db/migrations/operations/utils.py` by adjusting the `resolve_relation` function to handle app names with uppercase letters correctly. The RESPONSE does not mention this file or function and instead focuses on different parts of the codebase. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to review related logic and add tests is somewhat relevant, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
