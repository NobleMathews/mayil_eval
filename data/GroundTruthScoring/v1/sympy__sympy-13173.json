    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `degree` function to require an explicit generator for multivariate expressions and to raise an error if the generator is not specified, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes an updated error message to guide the user, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of a TypeError with a detailed message.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE proposes changes to the function signature and the handling of the generator argument, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff does not change the function signature but instead adds a check for the number of free symbols in the expression and raises an error if there is more than one, without changing how the generator is passed to the function.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a detailed explanation and code snippets to check, which are helpful but not directly related to the git diff changes. The RESPONSE does not mention the import of `ordered` from `sympy.core.compatibility`, which is present in the git diff and is used in the new error message.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative approach to the issue, which is effective and relevant, but it does not match the git diff in terms of the exact changes made. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
