    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating the change log between Scipy versions and adjusting parameters such as `tol` and `solver` in the ARDRegression constructor. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution involves creating a new file `_scipy_linalg.py` with a specific version of the `pinvh` function from Scipy 1.2.2 and modifying `fixes.py` to use this version when Scipy is 1.3 or newer. The RESPONSE does not mention anything about addressing the issue by using a specific version of `pinvh` or modifying any files, which is the core of the solution in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and does not offer any accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
