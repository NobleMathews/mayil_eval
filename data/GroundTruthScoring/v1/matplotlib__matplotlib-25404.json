    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an `_props` attribute to the `LassoSelector` class and initializing it in the `__init__` method, either with an empty dictionary or with the provided `props`. It also suggests implementing a `set_props` method to update the `_props` attribute with new properties.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does address the AttributeError by suggesting the addition of the `_props` attribute, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff removes the `_props` attribute entirely and refactors the code to avoid using it, which is a different approach than what the RESPONSE suggests. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add and use `_props` would not resolve the issue in the same way as the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of removing the `_props` attribute and handling properties differently. Instead, it suggests reintroducing the `_props` attribute, which is contrary to the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a viable alternative to the git diff and does not effectively address the specific issue described.",
