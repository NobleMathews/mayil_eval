    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_format_float` function to use Python's default string representation of the float value and then, if necessary, use scientific notation with a precision that ensures the total length does not exceed 20 characters. This approach is aligned with the git diff's intent to ensure the string representation of floats does not exceed 20 characters. However, the RESPONSE does not include the use of the walrus operator `:=` for the length check, which is present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the replacement of \"e\" with \"E\" in the scientific notation, which is a detail included in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides a detailed explanation and includes code snippets to check, which adds value to the developer. However, the RESPONSE's proposed solution is not as concise and does not match the git diff's approach as closely as it could. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff and offers actionable advice but is not a complete match.",
