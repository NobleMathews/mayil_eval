    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the Latex rendering of double superscripts in the `Commutator` class within the `sympy.physics.secondquant` module, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the changes needed to be made are in the `_latex` methods of the `CreateBoson` and `CreateFermion` classes, as well as a generic change in the `_latex` method of an unnamed class. The RESPONSE incorrectly assumes that changes need to be made to the `Commutator` class and provides a hypothetical code snippet that does not match the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to various parts of the codebase, which could be seen as somewhat helpful, but it does not direct the developer to the specific locations where the changes are needed according to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
