{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `__eq__` method in Django's `Model` class and provides a solution that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__eq__` method to return `NotImplemented` when the `other` object is not an instance of `Model`, which is consistent with the changes in the git diff for the `Model` class and other classes in Django.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets from other parts of the Django codebase, suggesting that these should be reviewed for similar issues. While this is not directly related to the git diff provided, it does not contradict it and could be seen as additional helpful advice for a more comprehensive fix across the codebase.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes a lot of additional information and code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff provided. This additional information does not necessarily align with the git diff's approach to the issue and could potentially lead to confusion or an expanded scope of work beyond what is necessary to resolve the specific issue described.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff for the key issue described, but it also includes extraneous information that is not directly related to the git diff. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate as it reflects the RESPONSE's relevance and alignment with the git diff while acknowledging the inclusion of additional, less relevant content.",
