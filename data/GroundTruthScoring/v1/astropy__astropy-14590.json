{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general review of the `MaskedNDArray.__array_ufunc__` method and suggests ensuring proper handling of output arrays when ufuncs are called with a `MaskedNDArray`. It also recommends checking for proper masking of the output array and updating the mask after the numpy ufunc operation.\n\nWhile these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they lack specific actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff. The git diff shows detailed changes to the `_combine_masks` method, including the addition of parameters and logic to handle where masks are combined and how the output is handled. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes or the addition of the `where` parameter and its usage.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. While these snippets may provide context, they do not offer actionable guidance for resolving the issue described.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not provide the specific, actionable guidance needed to resolve the issue, and it does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
