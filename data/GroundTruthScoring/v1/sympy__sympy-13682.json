    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general outline for implementing ordinal arithmetic in SymPy, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, it does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff shows the actual implementation of ordinal arithmetic with a new file `ordinals.py` containing the `OmegaPower` and `Ordinal` classes, as well as modifications to `__init__.py` and `str.py` to integrate the new functionality into SymPy. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, does not provide any concrete code or modifications to existing files, and instead offers a high-level description of steps to be taken, which lacks actionable content for the developer. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section titled 'Code snippets to check' with links to a repository and line numbers, which is not relevant to the task at hand and does not provide value in the context of the git diff. The score of 2 is given because the RESPONSE does mention the creation of a new class and the implementation of arithmetic operations, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff, but it fails to provide actionable guidance or specific code changes that would help the developer implement the solution.",
