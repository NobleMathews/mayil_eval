    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing `threading.local` with `asgiref.local.Local` in the `CacheHandler` class, which aligns with the git diff's changes. However, the RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by suggesting additional changes such as making methods in `CacheHandler` async or using `sync_to_async`, and implementing `asyncio.Lock` for locking mechanisms. These suggestions are not reflected in the git diff and may not be necessary for resolving the specific issue described. The git diff indicates that the issue can be resolved by simply changing the class used for `_caches` without altering method definitions or adding locking mechanisms. The RESPONSE does provide actionable advice and addresses the issue of data loss in async code, but it includes additional steps that are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is scored accordingly.",
