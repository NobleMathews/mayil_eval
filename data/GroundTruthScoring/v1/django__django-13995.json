    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to include `@cached_property` decorated properties in the Django admin documentation, which is the core issue. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `django.contrib.admindocs` app and suggests updating the introspection logic to check for `@cached_property` decorated methods, which aligns with the git diff's approach of modifying the `views.py` file to include `cached_property` in the condition. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating the documentation and templates, which is implied by the git diff's changes to comments and docstrings.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes shown in the git diff, such as the specific condition change in the `get_context_data` method. Instead, it offers a high-level overview and a different implementation outline that achieves the same goal. The RESPONSE also includes additional steps not present in the git diff, like updating the template for rendering the model documentation and adding unit tests, which are good practices but not part of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a viable alternative approach, it does not match the git diff exactly, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
