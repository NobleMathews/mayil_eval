    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new configuration option to the LaTeX printing settings and creating a helper function `print_text` to decide which LaTeX command to use. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also introduces a new configuration option (`gothic_re_im`) and modifies the LaTeX printing behavior accordingly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made to the code. The git diff shows a comprehensive update of the LaTeX representations throughout the codebase, replacing `\\mathrm` with `\\text` and making other related changes, such as updating the `_print_re` and `_print_im` methods to respect the new `gothic_re_im` setting. The RESPONSE's suggestion to replace all instances of `\\mathrm` and `\\text` with calls to a new `print_text` function does not reflect the actual changes in the git diff.\n\nMoreover, the RESPONSE includes a significant amount of additional information, such as code snippets and links to specific lines in a GitHub repository, which are not directly relevant to the issue or the git diff. This extraneous information does not provide actionable guidance for implementing the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant alternative approach but lacks alignment with the git diff's specific changes and includes unnecessary information. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
