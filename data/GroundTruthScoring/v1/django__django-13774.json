    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align closely with the changes made in the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to check and modify the implementation of `is_fetched` and `prefetch_one_level` to handle repeated instances and ensure that `to_attr` is set on all instances. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the logic in `prefetch_related_objects` and adjusting the caching mechanism if necessary, which is in line with the git diff's approach to refactoring the `is_fetched` function to be instance-specific rather than a single boolean value.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the creation of helper functions such as `has_to_attr_attribute`, `has_cached_property`, and `in_prefetched_cache`, which are present in the git diff. However, it does suggest refactoring `is_fetched` to consider all instances, which implicitly suggests a similar approach to what is done in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that `prefetch_one_level` is called appropriately, which is addressed in the git diff by changing the condition to check for a list of objects to fetch (`obj_to_fetch`).\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue, closely matching the git diff's solution without explicitly stating the exact code changes. It offers a valid, effective alternative to the git diff, and therefore, it receives a high score.",
