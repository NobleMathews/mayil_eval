    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a modification to the `interpolate` function to handle the case where `x` is beyond the range of `y` by returning the last element of `y`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a more comprehensive update to the `interpolate` function, including support for symbolic or numeric evaluation at point `x`, handling of symbolic coordinates, and a refactoring of the logic to use the `interpolating_poly` function. The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead offers a simplistic check for the range of `x` which is not in line with the git diff's approach to handling the interpolation logic.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a section on 'Code snippets to check' which is not relevant to the task of fixing the issue and does not provide actionable guidance for resolving the problem described in the ISSUE. This section seems to be a generic template text and does not contribute to solving the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of returning a value instead of `nan`, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the changes required to fix the issue. The score of 2 reflects that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
