    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with the prefetch_related behavior for GenericForeignKey, suggesting to check various methods and potentially override the prefetch_related behavior. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the __get__ method in the fields.py file to handle the case where the related object is None and is already cached, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE instead suggests checking the delete() method, the get_prefetch_queryset method, and the __set__ method, which are not part of the git diff solution. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a starting point for investigation, it does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 4, indicating that it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
