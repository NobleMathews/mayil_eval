    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps that are relevant to the issue of the Nystroem class not supporting precomputed kernels. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_get_kernel_params` method to handle the 'precomputed' kernel case without raising a `ValueError`, which aligns with the git diff that adds a condition to check for 'precomputed' kernel in the `_get_kernel_params` method. However, the RESPONSE suggests additional changes that are not reflected in the git diff, such as modifying the `fit` method, adding a check in the `fit_transform` method for the input to be a square matrix, and adding unit tests. While these suggestions are relevant and could potentially improve the handling of precomputed kernels, they are not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also includes a link to code snippets, which is helpful for locating the relevant sections of the code but does not directly contribute to solving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff and offers some actionable advice, but it also includes suggestions that extend beyond the scope of the changes shown in the git diff.",
