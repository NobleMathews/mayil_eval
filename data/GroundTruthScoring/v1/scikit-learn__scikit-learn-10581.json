{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear explanation of the issue with the `ElasticNet` class's `fit` method, which is that the `X` array is being modified even when `copy_X=True`. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `X` is copied before any modification when `copy_X=True` and that the `copy_X` parameter is respected throughout the `fit` method and any internal functions it calls. This aligns well with the git diff, which introduces a variable `X_copied` to track whether `X` has been copied and adjusts the `copy` parameter in the `check_X_y` and `_pre_fit` function calls accordingly.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that should be reviewed and potentially modified, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's solution, as it does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `X_copied` variable and the specific changes to the `copy` parameter in the function calls. Instead, it provides a general approach to solving the problem, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for a developer to review the relevant sections of code. However, these links are not directly related to the git diff's changes and are more of a general guidance, which is why the RESPONSE does not score higher within the 7-9 range.",
