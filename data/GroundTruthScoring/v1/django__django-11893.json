    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding ISO 8601 date formats to the `DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS` list in the locale files, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of DateTimeField not accepting ISO 8601 formatted date strings. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `to_python` method in `fields.py` to attempt parsing the datetime string with `parse_datetime` before falling back to the super method. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `to_python` method or using `parse_datetime`, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is related to the issue of date format parsing, it does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the specific problem.",
