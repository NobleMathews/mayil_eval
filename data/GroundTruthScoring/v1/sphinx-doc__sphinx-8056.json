    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the 'napoleon' extension configuration and ensuring that the numpydoc style is correctly followed, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which involves modifying the '_consume_fields' and '_parse_parameters_section' methods in the 'napoleon/docstring.py' file to handle multiple parameters on the same line. The RESPONSE also suggests upgrading Sphinx and its extensions and checking for any custom extensions or themes that might interfere with the rendering, which is not supported by the git diff and does not directly address the issue described. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution to the specific problem of rendering multiple input parameters in the docstring, which is what the git diff aims to resolve. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks actionable content that matches the git diff.",
