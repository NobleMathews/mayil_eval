    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is relevant and closely aligned with the git diff, offering clear guidance on how to handle the issue of decoding the response body of a redirect when it is not necessary. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'resolve_redirects' function to handle the specific case of a 301 redirect with incorrect gzip encoding, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to catch the 'ContentDecodingError' and handle it appropriately, which is reflected in the git diff's addition of error handling for 'ChunkedEncodingError', 'ContentDecodingError', and 'RuntimeError'. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of 'ChunkedEncodingError' and 'RuntimeError' to the exception handling, which are present in the git diff, and it does not include the change made in 'adapters.py' where the unnecessary 'r.content' call is removed. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a clear solution, it is not complete in addressing all aspects of the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that addresses the main issue described, which is the unnecessary decoding of the response body during a redirect. It suggests catching the 'ContentDecodingError' and handling it by setting 'resp._content' to the raw read content, which is similar to the git diff's approach of adding error handling for 'ChunkedEncodingError', 'ContentDecodingError', and 'RuntimeError'. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the 'resolve_redirects' function. However, it does not mention the additional error types handled in the git diff, nor does it address the change in 'adapters.py'. The RESPONSE's solution is actionable and relevant, but it is not as comprehensive as the git diff in addressing the issue.",
