    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a solution to the issue described. The git diff shows changes to the '_pytest/mark/structures.py' file, specifically refactoring the '_parse_parametrize_args' method and adding a new '_parse_parametrize_parameters' method. The RESPONSE, however, suggests pinning the pytest version to 4.5.0, investigating a 'bench/skip.py' file, and checking the pytest configuration file for new settings. None of these suggestions are related to the changes in the git diff, nor do they address the issue of tests being skipped without apparent reason in pytest 4.6.0. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer an alternative solution to the problem.",
