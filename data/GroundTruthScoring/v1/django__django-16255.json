    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_latest_lastmod` method to handle the case when `self.items()` returns an empty list and `self.lastmod` is callable, which is the core issue described. The proposed solution adds a check for an empty list before calling `max()` and returns `None` if the list is empty, which effectively prevents the `ValueError` from occurring. This approach is slightly different from the git diff but achieves the same result. The git diff uses the `default=None` parameter directly in the `max()` function call, while the RESPONSE adds an explicit check for an empty list before the `max()` call. Both solutions are valid and would resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but provides an alternative that is equally effective and relevant, hence the score of 9.",
