    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to making `BaseConstraint` arguments keyword-only, which is aligned with the ISSUE's request. However, the RESPONSE suggests removing `*args` and the associated warning, which does not match the git diff. The git diff shows that `*args` is being used to maintain backward compatibility and a warning is added to inform users of the deprecation. The RESPONSE fails to acknowledge the deprecation strategy and the transitional code that allows for backward compatibility, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly suggest updating the subclasses and documentation, which is in line with the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice but misses key aspects of the git diff's approach, warranting a score within the 4 to 6 range.",
