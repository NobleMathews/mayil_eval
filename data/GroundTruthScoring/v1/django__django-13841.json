    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general strategy for lazily accessing the `__file__` attribute, which is aligned with the issue's requirement to avoid using `__file__` at the module level. It suggests replacing module-level or class-level usage of `__file__` with a function that accesses `__file__` when needed, which is a valid approach and is reflected in the git diff for some of the files, such as `django/views/debug.py`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementations. For example, the git diff uses the `cached_property` decorator for `django/contrib/auth/password_validation.py`, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying `ExceptionReporter` to set paths in `__init__`, while the git diff introduces a new function `builtin_template_path` and uses it to obtain the paths.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets and references to specific lines in a GitHub repository, which are not relevant to the git diff provided. These references do not add value in the context of the git diff and can be misleading.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a partially correct approach but lacks specific details and contains irrelevant references, resulting in a score of 4.",
