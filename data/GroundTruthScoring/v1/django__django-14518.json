{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and clear guidance on how to modify the `_bad_token_message` method in the `CsrfViewMiddleware` class to include information about the source of the CSRF token. It aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the addition of a check for the `token_source` and modifying the error message accordingly. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates the changes, which is similar to the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE suggests creating unit tests to check for the correct error messages, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the removal of the `REASON_CSRF_TOKEN_INCORRECT` constant, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate as the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
