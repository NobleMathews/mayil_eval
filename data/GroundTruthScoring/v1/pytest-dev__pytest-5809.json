    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a step-by-step guide to locate and modify the relevant code in the `pastebin.py` file, which is the correct file according to the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to change the `lexer` variable from `'python3'` to `'text'`, which matches the git diff's change. The RESPONSE also suggests testing the `--pastebin` option to confirm the resolution of the HTTP 400 error, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the removal of the conditional check for the Python version, which is part of the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is the `lexer` value causing HTTP errors, and the RESPONSE addresses this correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a section with code snippets to check, which are not relevant to the issue or the git diff. This section does not provide additional value in resolving the issue and seems to be an unnecessary addition. However, the core advice given in the RESPONSE is aligned with the necessary changes to fix the issue, so the score reflects the high relevance and utility of the main guidance provided.",
