    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to symbols not being resolved as equal across different processes due to pickling and unpickling. The RESPONSE suggests general troubleshooting steps for handling symbols in multiprocessing scenarios, but it does not provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core problem of pickling.\n\nThe git diff shows changes to the pickling methods (`__getnewargs__`, `__getstate__`, `__setstate__`, and `__reduce_ex__`) across multiple files in the SymPy library, indicating that the solution involves modifying the way objects are serialized and deserialized. The RESPONSE, however, does not mention any of these methods or the concept of pickling at all.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant suggestions, such as ensuring consistent assumptions and using the `dill` library, which are not supported by the git diff. The git diff does not indicate that the `dill` library is used or that assumptions are inconsistent. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to pass a single `Symbol` object to subprocesses does not align with the git diff's approach to modifying the pickling methods.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to provide any insights or actionable guidance that would assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.",
