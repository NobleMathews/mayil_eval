    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__repr__` method in `astropy/utils/masked/core.py` and updating the `_array2string` function in `astropy/utils/masked/function_helpers.py` to handle structured dtypes correctly. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `__repr__` method or the `_array2string` function. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to the `MaskedFormat` class, specifically handling special cases for structured void and subarray dtypes by modifying the `format_function` and `format_functions` attributes.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `MaskedFormat` class to handle structured dtypes. Instead, it suggests a different approach that involves iterating over fields and applying `MaskedFormat` to each field individually, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention handling subarrays, which is addressed in the git diff.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling structured dtypes in masked arrays, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff and instead proposes an alternative solution that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
