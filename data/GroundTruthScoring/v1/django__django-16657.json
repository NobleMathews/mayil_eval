    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the 'order_by()' method from the query chain, which is a possible workaround but does not address the underlying issue of the 'update()' method not handling descending order by annotations. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the 'update()' method to correctly handle descending order by annotations, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it acknowledges the problem with the 'order_by()' method in combination with 'update()', but it fails to provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core issue. Therefore, it does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and only partially addresses the issue.",
