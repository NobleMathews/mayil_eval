{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to optimize the `get_search_results` method to reduce the number of JOINs in the query, which is the core issue described. It suggests using a single filter with combined `Q` objects, which aligns with the git diff's approach of constructing a list of `term_queries` and then applying a single filter. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the use of `icontains` for case-insensitive partial matches, which is a good practice for search functionality. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, as it suggests using `query &= or_queries` instead of appending to a list and then filtering with `models.Q(*term_queries)`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests removing the `may_have_duplicates` logic, which is not mentioned in the git diff, and it does not address the specific implementation of `smart_split` and handling of string literals as shown in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a solution that could potentially resolve the issue, it does not perfectly align with the git diff in every aspect.",
