    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue correctly as a TypeError caused by using a boolean array with the HuberRegressor's fit method. It correctly suggests that boolean arrays should be converted to floats before being used in operations not supported for boolean types. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide a specific actionable solution that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a 'dtype' parameter to the 'check_X_y' function call within the 'fit' method to ensure that the input is converted to an acceptable numeric type. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests manually checking and converting the type of 'X' within the 'fit' method, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to the file path as 'sklearn/linear_model/_huber.py' instead of 'sklearn/linear_model/huber.py' and provides a link to a non-existent GitHub repository. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests replacing the '-' operator with '~' or 'np.logical_not', which is not relevant to the actual issue or the git diff provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and contains inaccuracies.",
