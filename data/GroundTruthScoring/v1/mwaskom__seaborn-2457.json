    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `lineplot` function and the `_deprecate_ci` utility function to handle the case when `ci=None` is passed. It correctly identifies the need to issue a warning and to set `errorbar=None` in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not align perfectly with the git diff as it suggests adding a warning directly in the `lineplot` function, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff shows that the warning and the logic to handle `ci=None` are encapsulated within the `_deprecate_ci` function in `utils.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not entirely accurate according to the git diff, as it suggests checking `ci is not None` within the `lineplot` function, which differs from the git diff's approach of modifying the `_deprecate_ci` function to handle the deprecation logic. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the code snippets to check, which is helpful, but it includes an additional snippet (Lines 450 - 480) that is not directly related to the issue at hand. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers partial guidance but does not closely match the git diff.",
