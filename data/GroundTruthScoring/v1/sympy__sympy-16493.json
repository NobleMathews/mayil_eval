{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the method signature to provide a default value of `None` for the `indices` parameter, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly points out that the method body already contains the line `indices = indices or []`, which means that the logic within the method does not need to be changed, aligning with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes additional information about how to check the code snippets, which is not directly related to the git diff but could be useful for the developer to verify the changes in the context of the entire module. This additional information does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE but rather enhances it by providing a broader context for the change.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it includes links to code snippets and a detailed explanation of where to check the changes, which, while potentially useful, are not part of the git diff itself. The git diff focuses solely on the changes to the code, not on the process of reviewing those changes in the repository. However, this additional information does not mislead or detract from the core solution provided, which is why the RESPONSE scores highly.",
