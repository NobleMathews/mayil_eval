    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several steps to troubleshoot the issue, such as ensuring PyQt5 or PySide2 is installed, setting the QT_API environment variable, checking the `matplotlibrc` file or `MPLBACKEND` environment variable, and verifying the VS Code settings. While these are general troubleshooting steps that could be relevant to issues with Qt bindings, they do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff modifies the error message to list the correct Qt binding modules attempted for import, which indicates that the issue was not with the installation or environment variables but rather with the error reporting itself. The RESPONSE does not address this aspect of the issue and instead provides general advice that does not directly help to resolve the specific problem described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
