    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff, and it does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue might be related to the handling of the `milli` prefix in combination with units like `W` (Watts) and points to `sympy/physics/units/definitions/unit_definitions.py` for the definition of `W` and `mg`. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes needed are in `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`, specifically in the `Prefix` class and its multiplication and division methods. The RESPONSE fails to identify the correct file and the correct class where the changes are needed.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests defining a new `milliwatt` or `mW` quantity with the correct scale factor, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff does not introduce any new quantities but instead fixes the behavior of the `Prefix` class when multiplied or divided by another `Prefix` or when the resulting scale factor is 1.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides links to various code snippets that are not relevant to the issue at hand. The git diff indicates that the problem is with the return value when the scale factor is 1, which should be `S.One` instead of the integer `1` to maintain the correct type within the SymPy framework. The RESPONSE does not address this key aspect of the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE does not provide any insights or actionable steps that would assist developers in locating and fixing the issue as per the git diff. Therefore, it does not offer any real value in the context of the git diff.",
