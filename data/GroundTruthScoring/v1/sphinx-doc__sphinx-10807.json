    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps to address the issue of functions and members being placed under the last header of the module docstring in Sphinx documentation. However, the steps suggested do not align with the git diff provided, which includes a comprehensive set of changes across multiple files in the Sphinx project to implement a feature for automatically creating TOC entries for every function, class, and method. The RESPONSE focuses on the `ModuleDocumenter.add_content` method and other related methods, which is only a small part of the actual solution required according to the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the `Config` class, the addition of new methods in the `Directive` class, changes to various domain files, and updates to the `toctree` collector, none of which are addressed in the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
