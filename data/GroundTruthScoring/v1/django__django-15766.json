{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided by the user closely matches the git diff and addresses the issue of implementing robust `on_commit` handlers in Django. The RESPONSE outlines the necessary changes to the `on_commit` function and method, including the addition of the `robust` parameter and the handling of exceptions when `robust` is `True`. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating the documentation and tests, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE includes code snippets that are almost identical to the git diff, demonstrating a clear understanding of the required changes. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the RESPONSE includes a small amount of additional guidance on updating documentation and tests, which, while valuable, is not part of the git diff. However, this additional guidance does not detract from the overall alignment with the git diff and the issue.",
