    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying if the problem persists in the latest version of Matplotlib, updating Matplotlib if necessary, and considering opening an issue on the Matplotlib GitHub repository. It also suggests a temporary workaround by manually calculating the density and using `Axes.plot` to draw the step histogram. While these are general good practices for dealing with bugs, the RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to the auto-scaling of the density axis when using `histtype='step'`. The git diff provided shows a change in the `matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file, specifically modifying the `p.iter_bezier(simplify=False)` call. This indicates that the issue was resolved by changing how the path is iterated over for Bezier curves, which is not mentioned or addressed in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves a similar result. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and utility in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
