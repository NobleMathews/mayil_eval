    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `DatabaseIntrospection.get_relations` method to use `PRAGMA foreign_key_list` instead of regex parsing, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes a concise implementation that matches the logic of the git diff, replacing the old regex-based code with a loop that constructs a dictionary from the results of the `PRAGMA foreign_key_list` command. The RESPONSE does not include the additional changes made in the git diff, such as the import of `DatabaseError` and the raising of an exception if the table does not exist, but these are not directly related to the use of `PRAGMA foreign_key_list` to retrieve foreign keys. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue, justifying a high score.",
