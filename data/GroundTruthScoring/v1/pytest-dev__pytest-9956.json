    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some relevant advice regarding the correction of the test function by replacing the return statement with an assert statement, which aligns with the issue's description. However, the RESPONSE fails to address the main point of the issue, which is to implement a warning system for test functions that return non-None values. The RESPONSE suggests implementing a pytest hook and a configuration flag, but it does not provide any specific guidance on how to raise a warning, which is the core of the issue and the git diff. The git diff shows the addition of a new warning type `PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` and the necessary changes in the code to emit this warning when a test function returns a non-None value. The RESPONSE does not mention or align with these changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary steps such as correcting a typo in the parametrization data, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
