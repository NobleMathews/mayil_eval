    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to investigate and potentially resolve the issue, including checking for state variables, reviewing the implementation of `tight_layout()`, and understanding the context of the changes made in the relevant commits and pull requests. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the condition that triggers the warning and a simplification of the code formatting. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the condition to include a check for `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine`, which is the key change in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests looking at code snippets that are not directly related to the issue, which could lead the developer astray. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
