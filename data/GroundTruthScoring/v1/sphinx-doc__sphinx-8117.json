    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the configuration and updating Sphinx if necessary, which are general troubleshooting steps but do not address the specific code changes needed to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable code modifications or insights into the underlying problem with the Sphinx parser that the git diff indicates. The git diff shows that the code changes involve modifying the parsing logic to handle attributes in function parameters and qualifiers, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does mention checking the `sphinx/domains/c.py` file, which is relevant, but it does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the actionable changes shown in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
