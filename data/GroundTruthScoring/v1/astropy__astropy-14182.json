    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `__init__` method of the `RST` class to accept the `header_rows` argument, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of the `header_rows` parameter to the `__init__` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `write` method to handle `header_rows` when writing the table, which is in line with the git diff's changes to the `write` method. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `read` method that are present in the git diff, which are necessary for the complete support of header rows in RestructuredText output. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for reference, which is helpful but not necessary for the fix. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not complete as it omits the changes to the `read` method. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
