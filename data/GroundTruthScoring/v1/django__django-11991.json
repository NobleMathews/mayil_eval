    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable steps to implement support for adding non-key columns to indexes in Django, specifically for PostgreSQL's INCLUDE clause in CREATE INDEX. It aligns well with the git diff by suggesting modifications to the Index and UniqueConstraint classes, as well as the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor and PostgreSQLSchemaEditor classes, to handle the include parameter. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for database feature checks and updates to documentation and migrations. However, it does not provide the exact code changes shown in the git diff, such as the specific SQL templates and feature flags. Instead, it offers a general outline and some example code snippets that are in the right direction but not as detailed as the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the Index and UniqueConstraint classes to support the include parameter, which is in line with the git diff. It also mentions updating the BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor and PostgreSQLSchemaEditor to handle the include parameter when creating SQL for an index, which is consistent with the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests adding checks for database support of the include feature, which is also reflected in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact SQL templates and feature flags that are present in the git diff, such as the specific changes to sql_create_index and sql_create_unique_index, or the addition of supports_covering_indexes and supports_covering_gist_indexes in the features.py file. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it lacks some of the precise details and code changes shown in the git diff.",
