    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_print_Mul` function in `sympy/printing/str.py` to address the issue with the string representation of unevaluated `Mul` instances. However, the git diff indicates that the changes should be made in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and `sympy/printing/pretty/stringpict.py`, specifically to the `_print_Relational` and `_print_Mul` methods, as well as the `__mul__` method in `stringpict.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, as it suggests changes to a different file and does not mention the correct methods that need to be updated. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the resolution of the issue as per the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it correctly identifies the need for parentheses in certain cases, but it fails to provide the correct location and method for the fix. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
