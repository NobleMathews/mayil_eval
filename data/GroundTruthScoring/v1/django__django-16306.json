{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `BaseForm.__getitem__()` method to first attempt to retrieve the field from `self._bound_fields_cache` and handle a `KeyError` if the field is not found, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to populate `self._bound_fields_cache` with the new field before returning it, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional information about checking code snippets in the repository, which, while potentially helpful for locating the method, is not directly related to the solution itself. This additional information does not detract from the RESPONSE's utility in fixing the issue but does not add to it either, as the git diff already provides the exact location and changes needed. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8, as it provides highly relevant and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff but includes some unnecessary information.",
