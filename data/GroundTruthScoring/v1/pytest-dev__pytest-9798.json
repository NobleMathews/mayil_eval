{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align closely with the git diff and the issue description. It correctly identifies that the `numpy` module import should be removed from the `approx` function implementation, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that the error message generation does not require `numpy`, which is in line with the git diff that replaces `numpy.inf` with `math.inf`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to refactor the code to avoid using `numpy` specific features or provide a fallback mechanism is a valid alternative approach to the problem, even though it is not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific lines of code that need to be changed, as the git diff does, but it provides a high-level overview of the necessary changes, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
