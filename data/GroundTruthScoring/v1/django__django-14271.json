    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `annotate_active_subscription_id` method and ensuring that the `Subquery` and `OuterRef` are correctly referencing the `user_id` field. It also recommends checking for changes in Django 3.2 release notes and verifying the foreign key field name. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution to the problem described in the ISSUE, which is about combining two querysets in a subquery that fails in Django 3.2. The git diff shows that the solution involves updating the `combine` method in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file to include `self.subq_aliases |= rhs.subq_aliases`, which is not mentioned or alluded to in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, and it does not provide a viable alternative solution. It does, however, correctly identify that the issue is related to subqueries and provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the problem, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
