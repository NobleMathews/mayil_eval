    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating Sphinx to a newer version or refactoring the code to be more compatible with Sphinx's C++ domain parser. While updating Sphinx might be a general good practice, it does not address the specific issue described in the git diff, which involves modifying the parser implementation in `cpp.py` to handle certain C++ syntax correctly. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the parsing issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests submitting a bug report or feature request to the Sphinx project, which is not a solution but a deferral of the problem. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are not directly relevant to the issue at hand, as they do not correspond to the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
