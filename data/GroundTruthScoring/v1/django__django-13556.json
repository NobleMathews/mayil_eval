    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests checking the `on_commit` function definition to ensure it handles `None` values and raises a `TypeError` if `func` is `None` or not callable, which is exactly what the git diff does by adding a check for the callability of `func`. The RESPONSE also advises modifying the `on_commit` function to include a check for `None` and to raise a `TypeError` accordingly, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a TypeError raise. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is similar to the git diff, although it checks for `None` explicitly, which the git diff does not do. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the relevant code section, which is helpful for locating where the changes need to be made. The RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 because it includes an explicit check for `None` in the code snippet, which is not present in the git diff, and it also includes additional advice about ensuring that code calling `transaction.on_commit` does not pass `None`, which, while useful, is not part of the git diff.",
