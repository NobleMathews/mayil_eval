    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but lacks a close match to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the SQLite version and modifying the warning logic based on that, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling UniqueConstraint with `include` and `deferrable` on SQLite. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which makes changes to the `add_constraint` and `remove_constraint` methods in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` to handle the constraints directly rather than altering the warning logic. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests modifying `django/db/models/base.py`, which is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue but rather suggests an alternative approach that does not reflect the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader context of handling UniqueConstraint on SQLite, but it does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
