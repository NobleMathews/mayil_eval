    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a broad review of the `Intersection` class and related dispatch functions, which is a reasonable starting point for debugging. However, it does not provide a specific solution or actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change where duplicates are removed by converting the args to a set and then back to a list, ensuring a canonical order. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or any similar method to remove duplicates. Instead, it suggests reviewing and updating methods and dispatch functions without specifying what changes need to be made. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it identifies the correct file and methods that might be involved, it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
