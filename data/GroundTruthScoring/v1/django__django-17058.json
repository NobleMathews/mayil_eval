    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate guide on how to implement support for NULLS [NOT] DISTINCT in UniqueConstraint, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to update the `UniqueConstraint` class to accept a `nulls_distinct` parameter, modify the `__init__` method, update the `deconstruct` method, and handle the `nulls_distinct` option in the SQL generation within `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`. It also correctly suggests adding a feature flag in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` and overriding it in backend-specific features files like `django/db/backends/postgresql/features.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the need for system checks in `django/db/models/base.py` to warn about the use of `nulls_distinct` with unsupported backends.\n\nThe RESPONSE closely matches the git diff in terms of the files and methods that need to be updated, such as `UniqueConstraint.__init__`, `_unique_sql`, `_create_unique_sql`, and the addition of `supports_nulls_distinct_unique_constraints` in the features files. It also correctly identifies the need to override the feature flag for PostgreSQL 15, which aligns with the git diff.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score is that it does not explicitly mention the `cached_property` decorator for the PostgreSQL version check, which is present in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall accuracy and utility of the RESPONSE.",
