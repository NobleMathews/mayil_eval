    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff by suggesting a modification to the `set_response_etag` function to handle cases where `response.content` is empty. This aligns with the git diff's change to only set the ETag if `response.content` is present. However, the RESPONSE goes further by adding a check for the 'X-Sendfile' header and handling the ETag generation differently, which is not part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updates to `get_conditional_response` and `ConditionalGetMiddleware` to consider `Last-Modified` when `ETag` is unchanged, which is not addressed in the git diff. These additional changes are relevant to the issue but are not reflected in the git diff, indicating that the RESPONSE offers a more comprehensive solution than the git diff. However, since the git diff does not include these changes, the RESPONSE does not fully align with it. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 4 for offering actionable advice that partially matches the git diff but includes additional changes not present in the git diff.",
