    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `django.utils.http.urlencode` function to handle tuples correctly when `doseq` is `False`, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to fix the unexpected behavior with tuple values. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to change the `else` block to handle tuples as non-iterable when `doseq` is `False`. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's approach, which does not specifically check for tuples but rather changes the condition to `elif isinstance(value, (str, bytes)) or not doseq:` to handle all non-iterable cases when `doseq` is `False`. The RESPONSE's alternative solution of checking specifically for tuples and using `quote(str(value))` is a valid approach, but it is not as general as the git diff's solution, which would handle other non-iterable types as well. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a highly relevant and clear solution that closely aligns with the git diff but does not match it exactly.",
