    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_parse_attribute` function to ignore enum value attributes when parsing for documentation. However, the git diff shows a comprehensive refactoring that introduces a new class `ASTAttributeList` to handle attributes more effectively across various AST nodes, including enums. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling attributes as lists and updating the constructors and methods of several classes to use the new `ASTAttributeList` class. Instead, it suggests a narrower fix that does not reflect the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves a similar result.",
