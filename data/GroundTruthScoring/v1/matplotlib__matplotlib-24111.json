    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to handle the 'None' value for colormaps by modifying the `_ensure_cmap` function, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a new `get_cmap` method in the `ColormapRegistry` class to handle the 'None' case and updates the deprecation message for the old `get_cmap` function. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify `_ensure_cmap` is a reasonable alternative approach to the problem, but it does not match the git diff's approach of adding a new method and updating the deprecation message. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet and suggests updating the documentation, which is valuable. However, it does not address the removal of the experimental API notice or the addition of a comment for internal use in `_ensure_cmap`, which are also part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers actionable advice but does not fully align with the git diff.",
