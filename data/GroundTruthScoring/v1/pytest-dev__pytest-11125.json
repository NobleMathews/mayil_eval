    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `--run-podman` option from one of the `conftest.py` files or modifying both `conftest.py` files to conditionally add the `--run-podman` option only if it has not been added already. This advice does not align with the git diff provided, which shows changes to the `_set_initial_conftests` method in the `src/_pytest/config/__init__.py` file to handle the initial loading of conftest files differently. The git diff does not suggest any changes to the `conftest.py` files themselves or the handling of command-line options within them. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to resolve the issue described in the ISSUE.",
