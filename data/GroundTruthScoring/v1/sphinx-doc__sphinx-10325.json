{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_class_members` function and adding a configuration option to specify classes to be ignored, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff modifies the `inherited_members_option` function to return a set of class names and updates the `is_filtered_inherited_member` function to check against this set. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff and instead proposes a different approach involving a new configuration option and changes to functions that are not mentioned in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue of supporting multiple classes in the `:inherited-members:` option, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and references to files and lines that are not part of the git diff, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a low score for not aligning with the git diff and for providing guidance that is not directly applicable to the changes required to resolve the issue.",
