    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to connect the `setting_changed` signal to the `update_level_tags` function within the `MessagesConfig` class, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also suggests verifying that the `update_level_tags` function updates the `LEVEL_TAGS` correctly and recommends using the `@override_settings` decorator in tests, which is relevant to the issue described. Additionally, it advises checking if the `LEVEL_TAGS` dictionary is being updated and considers manually invoking `update_level_tags` in the test setup, which are practical troubleshooting steps. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the addition of imports and the `ready` method as shown in the git diff, but these are implementation details that the developer can infer from the RESPONSE's guidance on connecting the signal. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly valuable and nearly perfectly aligned with the git diff, warranting a score of 9.",
