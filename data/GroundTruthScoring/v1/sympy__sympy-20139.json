    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `MatrixSymbol` class to accept a string for the `name` parameter and to remove the conversion to `Symbol`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows that the `MatrixSymbol` constructor should use `Str(name)` instead of `Symbol(name)`. The RESPONSE also suggests raising a `TypeError` if the name is not a string, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `name` property and other methods to work with a string, but the git diff does not indicate any changes to the `name` property or other methods. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of using `Str` instead of `Symbol` for the name of `MatrixSymbol`, but it fails to provide the correct implementation details and includes unnecessary changes not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
