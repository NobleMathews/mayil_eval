    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a workaround to the issue by suggesting the removal of \"choice_set\" from the `list_display` and defining a method to handle the reverse relationship display. This is a valid approach to avoid the error, but it does not address the core issue described, which is to have a system check error for reversed foreign keys similar to the one for ManyToManyFields to prevent the error from occurring in the first place.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not suggest modifying the checks in the Django admin system, which is what the git diff does. The git diff modifies the `_check_list_display_item` function to include a check for reverse foreign keys, which would trigger a system check error (admin.E109) if such a field is used in `list_display`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, does not mention any changes to the system checks and instead focuses on how to display the related objects in the admin interface.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is helpful in providing a way to display related objects without causing an error, it does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue by updating the system checks. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant to the issue and the git diff, and it does not provide a complete solution to the problem described.",
