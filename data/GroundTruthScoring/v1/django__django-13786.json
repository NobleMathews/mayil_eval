{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code snippet that aims to address the issue of not unsetting model options when squashing migrations. It suggests modifying the `CreateModel.reduce` method, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE's code snippet is not identical to the git diff but achieves a similar outcome by ensuring that only the relevant options are kept, and the others are removed.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to test against Django version 2.2 and to ensure that `ALTER_OPTION_KEYS` contains all relevant keys, which is in line with the git diff's intent to handle the options correctly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE's code snippet does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, which uses a for loop to pop keys not present in `operation.options`. Instead, the RESPONSE uses a dictionary comprehension to filter keys. While this is a valid alternative approach, it is not a direct match to the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for further reference, which is helpful but not directly related to the git diff's changes. These links provide context but do not contribute to the actual solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not match it exactly. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
