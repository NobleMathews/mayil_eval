    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the default date limits in various methods and functions, which is somewhat relevant to the issue at hand. However, it does not provide specific actionable changes that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the changes need to be made in the `nonsingular` and `axisinfo` methods within the `dates.py` file, but the RESPONSE suggests modifying methods and functions that are not mentioned in the git diff, such as `set_default_intervals`, `apply_default_date_limits`, and `date_to_float`. Additionally, the RESPONSE refers to code snippets that are not part of the git diff, which could lead the developer to look in the wrong place. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to update test cases for empty date axes, which is why it receives a score of 3 instead of a lower score.",
