    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set and provides general advice on handling settings configuration and error messaging in Django. However, it does not address the specific issue described, which is to provide a more informative error message when a command does not exist outside a Django project. The git diff shows a specific change to the `fetch_command` method to handle the case where the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is not set, which the RESPONSE fails to mention. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves a similar result. It only vaguely suggests checking and updating error handling without concrete steps or acknowledgment of the specific problem. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses error handling in the context of Django settings, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
