    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately addresses the issue by suggesting to move the `settings._setup()` call inside the `handle` method of the `diffsettings` command to after the check for `settings.configured`. It also correctly advises to ensure that `settings._setup()` is only called if `settings.configured` is `False`. This matches the git diff provided, which adds a conditional check to only call `settings._setup()` if `settings.configured` is not True. The RESPONSE also includes references to the relevant code snippets, which would help the developer locate the code that needs to be changed. The RESPONSE is clear, actionable, and perfectly aligned with the git diff, providing a solution that would resolve the issue as described.",
