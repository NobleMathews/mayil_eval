    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to modify the `lambdify` function to correctly translate `lowergamma` and `uppergamma` from SymPy to the corresponding functions in SciPy, which is the core issue described. It correctly identifies that `lowergamma` should be translated to `gammainc` and `uppergamma` to `gammaincc`, and it also correctly notes the need to multiply by `gamma(a)` to account for the regularization in SciPy's implementation. The RESPONSE also correctly addresses the need to raise an error when `modules='numpy'` is used, as these functions are not supported in NumPy. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, but it offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result, which is to correctly handle the translation of gamma functions when using `lambdify` with SciPy. The RESPONSE does not include the exact code changes made in the git diff, such as the specific implementations of `_print_lowergamma`, `_print_uppergamma`, `_print_fresnelc`, and `_print_fresnels` in the various printer classes, nor does it mention the addition of 'beta' to the `_rewriteable_functions` and the `_known_functions_mpmath`. However, the RESPONSE's alternative solution is valid and effectively addresses the main concern of the issue, which is the incorrect lambdify translation for gamma functions. Therefore, it receives a high score for its relevance and utility in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
