    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the docstring to include the `args` parameter with a description that satisfies pylint's documentation requirements. However, this advice does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the regular expressions in the pylint codebase to correctly recognize parameters with asterisks in their names. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the pylint codebase for relevant checkers and warnings, which is somewhat relevant but does not provide actionable guidance to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the core problem of pylint not recognizing parameters with asterisks, which is what the git diff aims to resolve. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and does not offer a solution that would fix the issue described.",
