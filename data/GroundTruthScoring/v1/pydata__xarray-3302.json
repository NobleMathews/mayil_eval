    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `interp_na` function to include a new argument `max_consecutive_nans` which is conceptually similar to the `max_gap` argument introduced in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use the `_get_nan_block_lengths` function to calculate the length of consecutive NaN blocks, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using this function to determine gap lengths.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `max_gap` parameter to the `DataArray.interpolate_na` and `Dataset.interpolate_na` methods, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests combining interpolated values with the original data in a way that is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows a more integrated approach where the `max_gap` parameter is directly used within the interpolation process, rather than post-processing the interpolated data.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer, but these are not directly related to the actionable steps needed to implement the feature. The RESPONSE does not fully capture the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `scipy` intersphinx mapping and the detailed documentation updates within the interpolation functions.",
