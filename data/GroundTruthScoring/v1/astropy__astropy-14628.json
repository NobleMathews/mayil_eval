    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the `get_itrs` method in `astropy/coordinates/earth.py` to handle a `location` argument for topocentric positions, which aligns with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `ITRS` class in `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs.py` to accept a `location` argument, which is not part of the git diff and is not necessary for the issue at hand. The git diff shows that the `ITRS` class does not need to be modified; instead, the calculation for topocentric coordinates is handled within the `get_itrs` method itself. The RESPONSE also provides a high-level overview and pseudo code for the changes, which is helpful, but it includes unnecessary modifications to the `ITRS` class. The RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff's approach to the issue, as it suggests changes to the `ITRS` class that are not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the `copy=False` parameter used in the git diff when creating the topocentric `ITRS` object, which is a detail that could be relevant for performance reasons. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks complete alignment with the git diff and the specific issue described.",
