    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring SkLearn version compatibility and converting Dask DataFrames to NumPy arrays before scoring, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the sklearn/utils/validation.py file, where a type check is added to handle the case when Dask DataFrames do not return a numeric shape[0] value. The RESPONSE does not address this specific solution or provide an alternative that would resolve the issue without converting to NumPy arrays. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
