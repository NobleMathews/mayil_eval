    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `set_ticks` method in `axis.py` to validate `kwargs` even when `labels` are not set. It also correctly identifies the need to raise an error if any `kwargs` are not valid `Text` properties, which is in line with the git diff that adds a check to raise a ValueError if `kwargs` are passed without `labels`. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of simply raising an error when `kwargs` are passed without `labels`. Instead, it suggests using `validate_text_properties` to validate each property in `kwargs`, which is a more complex solution and not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes pseudo-code and a reference to a non-existent `validate_text_properties` function, which could potentially lead to confusion as this function does not exist in the provided git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change needed, which is a direct raise of ValueError as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of providing the exact solution required to fix the issue.",
