    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the logic in the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file to handle the `__init__` method's return type correctly when `autodoc_typehints` is set to \"description\". However, the git diff provided shows that the actual changes needed to fix the issue are in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` file, not in `sphinx/domains/python.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `modify_field_list` function and adding a condition to suppress the return type for classes when `autodoc_typehints_description_target` is set to \"all\". The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the problem with the return type of `__init__` methods in the documentation, but it fails to provide a solution that aligns with the necessary changes shown in the git diff.",
