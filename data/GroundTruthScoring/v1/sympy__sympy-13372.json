    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding 'Max' to the 'evalf_table' and defining an 'evalf_max' function, which is not related to the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue is with the handling of 're' and 'im' when they are not numbers, and it resolves the issue by adding an 'else' clause that raises a 'NotImplementedError'. The RESPONSE does not address this aspect of the issue. However, the RESPONSE does correctly suggest adding an 'else' block to handle cases where 'reprec' and 'imprec' are not set, which aligns with the git diff's addition of 'else' clauses that raise 'NotImplementedError'. This part of the RESPONSE is actionable and partially aligns with the git diff, but the rest of the RESPONSE is not relevant to the specific issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a low score because it only partially addresses the issue and does not provide a complete solution that aligns with the git diff.",
