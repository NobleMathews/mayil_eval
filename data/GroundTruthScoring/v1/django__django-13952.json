{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `emit_pre_migrate_signal` and `emit_post_migrate_signal` functions to accept and use a `stdout` parameter instead of `sys.stdout`. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating the `migrate` command to pass `self.stdout` to these functions. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a recommendation to ensure that tests capture the output correctly, which is relevant to the issue but not explicitly covered in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it effectively addresses the issue and provides a solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE is comprehensive and includes references to code snippets, which would be very helpful for a developer looking to fix the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not exactly match the git diff, but it is still a highly valuable and relevant solution.",
