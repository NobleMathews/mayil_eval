    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the TypeError and correctly identifies that the issue is related to the use of a list where a hashable type is expected. It also correctly points out that the `transpose` method is involved and suggests that the `infix_dims` function could be the source of the error. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a check in the `transpose` method to raise a more informative error when a list is passed as the first element of `dims`. The RESPONSE does not suggest adding such a check or raising a custom error message, which is the core of the solution in the git diff. Instead, it provides a general suggestion to ensure that `infix_dims` handles the `dims` argument correctly and to check other parts of the `transpose` method without specific instructions on what changes to make. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the solution provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
