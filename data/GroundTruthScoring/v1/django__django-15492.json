    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method called `synchronize_user` to the `RemoteUserBackend` class and calling this method in the `authenticate` method after fetching the user from the database. This approach is somewhat aligned with the ISSUE, which requests a way to synchronize user attributes on every authentication. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the GIT DIFF, which does not introduce a new `synchronize_user` method but instead modifies the `configure_user` method to accept a new parameter `created` and uses a deprecation warning to guide developers towards the necessary changes for Django 5.0.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention the deprecation warning and the use of `func_supports_parameter` to check for the presence of the `created` parameter, which are key elements in the GIT DIFF. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the `configure_user` method signature and the related comments in the GIT DIFF. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the GIT DIFF. It provides a different solution that does not take into account the deprecation path and the specific implementation details provided in the GIT DIFF.",
