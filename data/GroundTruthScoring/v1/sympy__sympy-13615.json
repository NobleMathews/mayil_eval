    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the `Complement` function not producing the expected output when the input is a mixture of Symbols and numbers. It correctly suggests that the `Complement` function should handle sets with mixed types and that the `FiniteSet` class should be able to store elements of different types. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff introduces a `ternary_sift` function and uses the `sift` utility to separate elements based on whether they are contained in the set, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Complement.reduce` method and implementing a loop to handle symbols and numeric values differently, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to the `reduce` method, which does not exist in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a pseudocode example that does not match the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach, and the pseudocode provided would not resolve the issue as effectively as the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
