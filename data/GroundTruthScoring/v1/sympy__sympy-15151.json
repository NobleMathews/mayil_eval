    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative to the issue described. The git diff shows a change in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, specifically in the `_print_Indexed` method, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of indexed objects. The RESPONSE, however, incorrectly refers to the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file and the `_printer_tensor_indices` method, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also provides a high-level overview and pseudo-code that does not correspond to the actual changes needed according to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
