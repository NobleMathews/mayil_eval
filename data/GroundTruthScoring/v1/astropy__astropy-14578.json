    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a workaround for the issue by converting `None` values to a FITS-compatible representation before writing to FITS. This approach does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `astropy/io/fits/column.py` file to handle object types directly within the FITS writing process by raising an error when encountering unsupported object types or mixed types in a column.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a solution that modifies the code to handle the issue directly, as the git diff does. Instead, it suggests a manual preprocessing step that the user must perform before writing the table to FITS. While this might be a temporary workaround, it does not address the underlying issue in the code that the git diff aims to fix.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to modifying the FITS column handling to raise a more meaningful error message when encountering unsupported types.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with object types in FITS files but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. The score reflects the RESPONSE's limited relevance and lack of alignment with the git diff's solution.",
