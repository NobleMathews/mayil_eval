    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing checks to prevent setting invalid axes limits when switching to log scale and modifying the `reset_view` function to restore original autocomputed axes limits. While the RESPONSE addresses the issue of handling zeros in log-scale and provides a code snippet to prevent invalid limits, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows changes to the `_get_view` and `_set_view` methods to include autoscaling state in the view's information, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `reset_view` function and the key press event handling is not reflected in the git diff, indicating a different approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the reported issue of restoring the original behavior of autocomputed axes limits after zooming and switching scales. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a low score.",
