    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `aggregate` method in the `TableGroups` class to handle `SkyCoord` objects by skipping the aggregation for `SkyCoord` columns or providing a custom aggregation function. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it acknowledges the problem with `SkyCoord` objects not having a `groups` attribute. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which provides a comprehensive solution by adding the `groups` attribute to the `ColumnInfo` class and handling the aggregation logic in a way that supports `SkyCoord` and other mixin columns. The RESPONSE's suggestion to skip aggregation for `SkyCoord` columns does not solve the issue but rather avoids it, which is not the goal of the issue description. The RESPONSE also includes unnecessary code snippets and references to specific lines in the repository, which are not directly related to the solution and do not provide actionable guidance. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
