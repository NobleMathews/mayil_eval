    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a method called `object_from_equation` in both `line.py` and `circle.py` to convert an equation into a geometry object. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of creating geometry objects from an equation, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the constructors of the `Line` and `Circle` classes have been modified to directly accept an equation as an argument, rather than adding a separate method as suggested in the RESPONSE.\n\nMoreover, the RESPONSE's implementation details are incorrect and incomplete. It suggests using `linear_coeffs` for the `Line` class and `solve` for the `Circle` class without proper handling of the equation's form or validation. The git diff, on the other hand, shows a more comprehensive approach, including the handling of different forms of equations and the use of the `linear_coeffs` function for both classes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a large section of irrelevant information about checking code snippets in a repository, which does not provide actionable guidance for implementing the feature.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the topic of creating geometry objects from equations but fails to provide actionable or accurate guidance aligned with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
