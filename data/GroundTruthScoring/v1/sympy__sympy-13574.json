    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue with the `randMatrix` function not generating symmetric matrices when the `percent` parameter is set to values other than 100. It also offers a solution that aligns with the git diff in terms of ensuring that the symmetry of the matrix is preserved regardless of the `percent` value. The RESPONSE suggests an algorithm that fills both the upper and lower triangular parts of the matrix with the same random values, which is similar to the approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE's proposed solution includes shuffling the `ij` list before selecting a subset based on the `percent` value, which is a different method from the git diff but achieves the same goal of randomness and symmetry. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle symmetric positions for non-diagonal elements, which is in line with the git diff's approach. However, the RESPONSE does not include the change in the calculation of the number of zeros to be inserted, which is present in the git diff. This omission does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is the symmetry of the matrix, which the RESPONSE addresses effectively. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for providing a highly relevant and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff.",
