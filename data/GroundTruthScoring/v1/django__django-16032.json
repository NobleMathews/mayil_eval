    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the subquery constructed with `Book.objects.filter` or `Publisher.objects.filter` is using `values()` or `values_list()` with a single field, which is a general approach to solving issues with subqueries returning an incorrect number of columns. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as removing `self.rhs.clear_select_clause()` and replacing `self.rhs.add_fields([target_field], True)` with `self.rhs.set_values([target_field])` in `related_lookups.py`, or the addition of `has_select_fields` and the removal of the `has_select_fields` property in `query.py`. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but it does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, therefore it receives a score of 2.",
