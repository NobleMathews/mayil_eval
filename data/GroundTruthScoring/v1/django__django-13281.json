{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the use of `deepcopy()` instead of `copy()` to handle the copying of model instances correctly in Django >= 2.0. This aligns with the git diff's approach to ensuring that the `_state` attribute, which contains the `fields_cache`, is properly copied. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as creating a copy of the `__dict__` and explicitly copying the `_state` and `fields_cache`. Instead, it suggests a more general approach of using `deepcopy()` or manually copying the `_state` after a shallow copy. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that could be helpful for the developer, but it does not match the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but these are not directly related to the solution provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff's approach.",
