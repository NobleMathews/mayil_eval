    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the class definition to include a type hint for the `a` property and moving the attribute docstring to be directly under the property definition. It also recommends ensuring that the Sphinx `conf.py` file includes certain extensions and setting the `autodoc_typehints` configuration. Lastly, it advises updating Sphinx to the latest version if the issue persists.\n\nThe git diff provided shows a change in the `sphinx/pycode/parser.py` file, which adds support for position-only parameters by checking for 'posonlyargs' in the current function's arguments. This is a direct fix to the issue described, which is related to Sphinx not parsing docstrings for attributes when position-only parameters are used.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it does not suggest modifying the Sphinx parser to handle position-only parameters. Instead, it suggests changes to the user's code and Sphinx configuration, which may not resolve the issue if the underlying problem is with Sphinx's ability to parse position-only parameters. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the documentation generation issue but fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and does not address the core problem of Sphinx's parser not handling position-only parameters. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability in the context of the git diff.",
