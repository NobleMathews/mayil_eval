    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes required to fix the issue. The git diff shows that the `available` attribute is being added to various backend classes and the conditional registration of backends is being removed, allowing all backends to be registered regardless of whether their dependencies are installed. The RESPONSE, however, suggests adding an `installed()` method and modifying the `open_dataset()` method, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a detailed implementation plan that does not match the changes in the git diff and therefore does not provide actionable guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not contribute to fixing the issue.",
