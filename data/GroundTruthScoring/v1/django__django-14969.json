    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `PermissionRequiredMixin` class in `django/contrib/auth/mixins.py` and updating the `get_permission_required` method to raise a `TypeError` if `permission_required` is a string. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual changes were made to the `has_perms` method in `django/contrib/auth/models.py` to include a check for the `perm_list` argument and raise a `ValueError` if it is not an iterable of permissions or if it is a string.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests changes to a different file and class, and it proposes raising a different type of error (`TypeError` instead of `ValueError`). Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of checking the `perm_list` argument within the `has_perms` method, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff or the issue described, and it does not offer a viable alternative approach to the solution presented in the git diff.",
