    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and relevant solution to the issue of adding a `location` keyword argument to the `Colorbar` constructor in Matplotlib. It outlines the necessary steps and provides code snippets that align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE suggests updating the `Colorbar` constructor, modifying the `_normalize_location_orientation` function, ensuring mutual exclusivity of the parameters, and updating documentation, which are all actions reflected in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `_get_orientation_from_location` and `_get_ticklocation_from_orientation` helper functions, and the specific error handling for incompatible combinations of `location` and `orientation`. While the RESPONSE does not match the git diff line by line, it does offer a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to allow the `location` parameter to control both `orientation` and `ticklocation`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue, justifying a score of 7.",
