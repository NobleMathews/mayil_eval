    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `adapt_method_mode` function to properly log the adaptation of synchronous middleware, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating the log message conditions to check for `name` and `method_name` separately, which is in line with the git diff's approach to handling middleware and method names distinctly. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that the `name` parameter is passed correctly when calling `adapt_method_mode` for middleware methods, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests using 'Asynchronous %s adapted.' for the `name` case within the synchronous branch, and 'Synchronous %s adapted.' for the `name` case within the asynchronous branch, which is the opposite of what the git diff suggests. However, this does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main goal is to ensure that the correct type of handler (synchronous or asynchronous) is being logged with the correct name. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue, hence the score of 9.",
