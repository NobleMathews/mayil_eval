    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general overview of the issue and suggests areas of the code that might be relevant to the problem. However, it does not offer specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by handling the 'rubric' node differently in the 'process_doc' method, specifically by adding an 'elif' condition to handle 'rubric' nodes separately from 'section' nodes. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or approach, nor does it provide any code-level details or modifications that would help the developer fix the issue. Instead, it gives a high-level description of what needs to be done without actionable steps, and it references code snippets that are not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
