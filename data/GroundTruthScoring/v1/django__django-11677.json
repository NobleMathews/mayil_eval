    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the `Invoice` model for the existence of an `owner` field and its correct configuration, which is not relevant to the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was with the resolution of expressions in the `where.py` file, specifically the `_resolve_rhs` method which has been renamed to `_resolve_leaf` and updated to handle both `lhs` and `rhs` attributes. The RESPONSE does not address this change at all.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking the `test_nested_subquery_outer_ref_3` method for incorrect usage of the keyword 'owner', which is somewhat relevant as the issue description mentions a `FieldError` related to the 'owner' keyword. However, the git diff does not include any changes to the test methods, so this advice does not align with the actual fix.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but these are general suggestions and do not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
