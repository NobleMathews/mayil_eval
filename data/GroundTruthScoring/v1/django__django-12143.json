    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using re.escape() to escape the prefix before using it in the regex pattern, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes the correct context of usage within the SomeAdminClass and the relevant method, which is similar to the context provided in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not include the exact change in the form of a git diff, but it provides a clear explanation of how to implement the fix, which is to escape the prefix using re.escape(). The additional code snippets provided are not directly related to the fix but demonstrate the correct use of re.escape() in other parts of Django, which supports the validity of the proposed solution. The RESPONSE does not directly modify the _get_edited_object_pks method as shown in the git diff, but the solution it offers is effectively the same and would resolve the issue.",
