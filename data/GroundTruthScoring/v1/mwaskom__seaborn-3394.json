{
    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing `pd.NA` with `np.nan` in the DataFrame before plotting, which is a workaround rather than a direct solution to the issue. While this advice might be somewhat relevant, it does not address the underlying problem in the seaborn library that is causing the axis ordering to reverse when `pd.NA` values are present. The git diff shows changes to the seaborn library code that handle `pd.NA` values correctly by converting series to numeric and dropping NA values before type inference, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references a code snippet from a non-existent URL, which does not add value to the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 1, indicating it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
