    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file to include a more descriptive error message when a `KeyError` is encountered due to a missing migration node. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file to handle the case where a target migration is missing by reloading the graph without replacements. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of handling replaced migrations and instead focuses on improving error messaging, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and fails to provide actionable guidance that would assist a developer in fixing the issue as described. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a score higher than 0.",
