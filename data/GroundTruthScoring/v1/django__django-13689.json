{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ExpressionWrapper.get_group_by_cols` method to handle cases where the expression is a `Q` object with a `None` check, which is somewhat related to the issue of the expression being omitted from the `GROUP BY` clause. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves checking if `self.expression` is an instance of `Expression` and then handling it accordingly. The RESPONSE's suggestion to look for a `Q` object and its children is not supported by the git diff and does not address the actual problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that is not in line with the git diff's solution and could potentially introduce new issues, as it assumes the presence of a `Q` object and a `None` check, which is not necessarily the case. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and is not effective in resolving the issue as described. Therefore, it receives a low score for its limited relevance and lack of alignment with the git diff.",
