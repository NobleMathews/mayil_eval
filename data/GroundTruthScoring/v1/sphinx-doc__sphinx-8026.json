    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a high-level overview of the changes needed to implement the requested feature for more customization options for `figure_language_filename` for localized images in Sphinx. It suggests introducing new tokens such as `{relative_path}` and `{resolved_path}` and updating the `filename_format` string formatting to use these new tokens. The RESPONSE also emphasizes ensuring that `{root}` and `{path}` are relative to the Sphinx project's root folder, which aligns with the git diff's approach to adding a new `docpath` token and making adjustments to the `d` dictionary to support the new functionality.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests additional tokens (`{relative_path}` and `{resolved_path}`) that are not present in the git diff. The git diff specifically adds a `docpath` token and makes adjustments to the `d` dictionary to include `docpath` and `language`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to make `{root}` and `{path}` relative to the project's root does not directly align with the git diff, which does not modify these tokens but rather adds a new one.\n\nThe RESPONSE is actionable and provides a clear direction for implementing the feature, including the need to handle edge cases and update documentation. It also correctly identifies the need to add unit tests for the new feature. The inclusion of code snippets and links to relevant sections of the Sphinx project's codebase is helpful and adds value to the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a solution that achieves similar results to the git diff, although it does not match the git diff exactly. It provides actionable guidance that would assist a developer in implementing the requested feature, justifying a score of 7.",
