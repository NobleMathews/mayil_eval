    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code solution that addresses the issue of using DISTINCT with GROUP_CONCAT in SQLite through Django's ORM. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the GroupConcat class to handle the distinct and delimiter parameters correctly and updating the check_expression_support method to allow DISTINCT when a single argument is provided to GROUP_CONCAT.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in that it recognizes the need to update the check_expression_support method to account for the use of DISTINCT in GROUP_CONCAT. The git diff specifically adds a condition to check for the distinct attribute in the expression, which is in line with the RESPONSE's suggestion to update the check to allow DISTINCT with a single argument.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE goes further by suggesting modifications to the GroupConcat class, which is not part of the git diff. While this additional suggestion is not necessary to resolve the issue described, it does not conflict with the git diff and could be seen as an enhancement to ensure the GroupConcat class behaves correctly according to SQLite's capabilities.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes additional suggestions not present in the diff. However, the core of the RESPONSE's solution to update the check_expression_support method is aligned with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a solution that is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
