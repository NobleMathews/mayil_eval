    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `UniqueConstraint` class's `__init__` method to include a validation check that raises a `ValueError` if `deferrable` is used with `include` and/or `opclasses`. This aligns with the git diff, which adds similar checks to raise `ValueError` when `deferrable` is combined with `include` or `opclasses`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the issue is with the combination of parameters at the Python level, not with the SQL generation, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests a single check for both `include` and `opclasses`, whereas the git diff adds separate checks for each. However, the RESPONSE's approach is still valid and achieves the same result, which is to prevent the combination of `deferrable` with `include` and `opclasses`. Therefore, it should not be penalized for this slight difference.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it includes an unnecessary reference to code snippets related to SQL generation, which, while not incorrect, is not directly relevant to the changes needed to address the issue as per the git diff. The git diff focuses solely on the Python-level validation without any changes to SQL generation logic.",
