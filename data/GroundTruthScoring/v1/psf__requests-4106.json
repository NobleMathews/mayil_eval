{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the absence of the 'requests.packages.urllib3' attribute and suggests that the commit provided in the issue description may have caused the problem. The RESPONSE then offers a solution that involves reviewing the commit to identify changes that may have caused the issue and ensuring that 'requests/packages.py' properly aliases the 'urllib3' package. The RESPONSE also suggests setting 'sys.modules['requests.packages.urllib3'] = urllib3' to ensure backward compatibility, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of using 'locals()[package] = __import__(package)'. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but offers a solution that could effectively resolve the issue. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by suggesting code snippets to check, which could be helpful for the developer. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change needed, which is why it does not score higher.",
