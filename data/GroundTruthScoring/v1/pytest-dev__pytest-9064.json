    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the help text for the `--stepwise` and `--stepwise-skip` flags, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a clarification in the help message. However, the RESPONSE goes further by suggesting modifications to the `StepwisePlugin` class and the `pytest_runtest_protocol` method, which are not part of the git diff. The git diff shows a simpler solution by adding a conditional check in the `pytest_configure` function to set `config.option.stepwise` to `True` if `config.option.stepwise_skip` is `True`, effectively enabling `--stepwise` when `--stepwise-skip` is used. The RESPONSE does not mention this straightforward approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `parse_args` function correctly parses the flags, which is not part of the git diff and may not be necessary given the context of the issue. The RESPONSE partially aligns with the git diff by addressing the help text but does not provide the specific, simpler solution shown in the git diff. Therefore, it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and partially relevant, warranting a score of 4.",
