    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that directly aligns with the git diff. It suggests adding a check in the `MLPRegressor`'s `partial_fit` method to raise a `ValueError` if `early_stopping` is set to `True`, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE offers an alternative solution to initialize `self.loss_curve_` to avoid `NoneType` subtraction errors, which is not part of the git diff but is a valid and effective alternative approach to ensure that the code does not fail due to uninitialized variables. The RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets, which could help the developer locate the areas of the code that need to be modified. Overall, the RESPONSE offers clear, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff and provides additional context and alternative solutions that are relevant and effective.",
