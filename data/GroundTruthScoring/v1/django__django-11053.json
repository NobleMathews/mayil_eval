    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `configure` function to raise a `TypeError` for non-uppercase setting names, which matches the git diff's addition of a check in the `configure` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__` to raise an `AttributeError` for non-uppercase names, which is also in line with the git diff's change to include a check for uppercase names in the `__getattr__` method. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation (e.g., the exact error message), but it achieves the same result, which is to disallow non-uppercase settings in `settings.configure()` and `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__()`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that no other code snippets need to be changed, focusing only on the relevant parts of the code. The score is not a full 10 because the RESPONSE provides a slightly different implementation by including a separate error message for the `AttributeError` in `UserSettingsHolder.__getattr__`, which is not present in the git diff.",
