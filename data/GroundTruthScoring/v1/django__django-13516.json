    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the developer should ensure that the `flush()` method is called after each output statement in the `migrate.py` file, which is a reasonable suggestion for ensuring real-time output. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows that the actual fix was to add a `flush()` method to the `OutputWrapper` class in `django/core/management/base.py`. The RESPONSE incorrectly focuses on modifying the `migrate.py` file and does not mention the need to modify the `OutputWrapper` class. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of real-time output during migrations, it fails to provide the correct actionable guidance based on the git diff. Therefore, it only partially addresses the issue and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
