    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is the coercion of list to tuple in the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` method. The suggested code change in the RESPONSE closely matches the git diff by using a generator expression to resolve the values and then creating an instance of the original type, whether it's a list or a tuple. This ensures that the original type is preserved, which is the main goal of the fix.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes an additional check for namedtuples using `hasattr(type_, \"_make\")`, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the effectiveness of the solution, as it still achieves the same result of preserving the original iterable type. The RESPONSE also omits the parameters `simple_col` from the method signature and the call to `resolve_expression`, which are present in the git diff. This omission could be an oversight or a simplification for the example provided.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative to the git diff that would resolve the issue effectively. It is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
