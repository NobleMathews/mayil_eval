    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the need to deprecate `django.conf.urls.url()` and provides a detailed explanation of how to do so, including adding a deprecation warning and updating the documentation. The provided pseudo code for adding a deprecation warning is very similar to the git diff, which also adds a deprecation warning using the `warnings` module and the `RemovedInDjango40Warning` class. The RESPONSE does not mention updating the `JavaScriptCatalog` class in `django/views/i18n.py`, which is included in the git diff, but this is a minor part of the issue and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to follow the Django deprecation policy is also relevant and helpful for the developer.",
