    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file and checking for changes related to `ManyToManyField` handling, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. It also correctly identifies the need to look at the commit `2f73e5406d54cb8945e187eff302a3a3373350be` for potential causes of the regression. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` file, specifically adding a special case for handling implicit M2M tables by creating the model if it's auto-created. The RESPONSE fails to mention the specific file and method that needs to be modified according to the git diff, nor does it suggest adding the special case handling that the git diff includes. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed to prevent the table rebuild when adding a `ManyToManyField`. The RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
