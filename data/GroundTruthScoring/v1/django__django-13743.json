{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `is_broken_pipe_error` function to include `ConnectionAbortedError` as part of the tuple of exceptions that are checked to determine if an error is a broken pipe error. The RESPONSE also includes `ConnectionResetError`, which is present in the git diff, indicating that the RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention `ConnectionResetError`, but it is included in the provided code snippet, which suggests that the responder is aware of its relevance. The RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code sections, which is helpful for the developer to locate the function that needs to be modified. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not explicitly mention `ConnectionResetError` in the text, even though it is included in the code snippet.",
