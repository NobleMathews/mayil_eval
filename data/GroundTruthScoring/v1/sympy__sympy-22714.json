    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the `evaluate` flag not being properly passed down to the `Point2D` constructor and provides a solution to modify the `evaluate` context manager and the `Point.__new__` method to respect the `global_parameters.evaluate` flag. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix was to change the condition in the `Point.__new__` method to check if the imaginary part of a coordinate is non-zero rather than just checking if it is a number.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the specific condition that was causing the error, which is related to the handling of imaginary parts of coordinates. Instead, it focuses on the handling of the `evaluate` flag, which is not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the `Point.__new__` method and the `evaluate` flag, which are part of the context of the issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and does not help the developer to locate and fix the issue as per the diff provided. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
