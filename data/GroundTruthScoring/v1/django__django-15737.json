    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to address the issue of unnecessary database reads when accessing a related object's fields. It suggests modifying the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which aligns with the git diff's change in the same method. However, the RESPONSE goes beyond the scope of the git diff by suggesting additional changes in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` and reviewing the logic in `ForeignKeyDeferredAttribute` and `DeferredAttribute`. These additional suggestions are not supported by the git diff and are not necessary to resolve the specific issue described. The RESPONSE also fails to provide the exact change needed, which is to replace `setattr(self, field.attname, obj.pk)` with `setattr(self, field.name, obj)`. Instead, it provides a more general instruction to adjust the logic to check for a cached value before setting the `field.attname` attribute. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff or provide the precise change required to fix the issue.",
