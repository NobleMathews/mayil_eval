    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_get_mask` function to handle string representations of NaN and to use `np.isnan` when `missing_values` is `np.nan`. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, which involves a type mismatch between `X` and `missing_values`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a new function `_check_inputs_dtype` to explicitly check the data types of `X` and `missing_values` before any comparison is made. The RESPONSE fails to mention the addition of this new function or the changes to the `_validate_input` and `_initial_imputation` functions that call `_check_inputs_dtype`. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is only partially relevant to the issue described.",
