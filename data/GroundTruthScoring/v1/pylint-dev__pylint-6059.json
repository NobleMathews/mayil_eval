    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice and partially match the git diff but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `BaseChecker` class to determine if the `__gt__` method is necessary and to write unit tests or remove the method accordingly. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `__gt__` method and adds `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods, indicating that the `__gt__` method is indeed necessary and should be kept and properly defined. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `__eq__` and `__hash__` methods, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the `__gt__` method and for making the `BaseChecker` class hashable. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that could be relevant for understanding the usage of `__gt__`, but it does not directly address the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the issue at hand.",
