    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the subquery only returns a single column and provides a potential solution that involves using `property_groups.values_list(\"id\", flat=True)` to return a flat list of IDs. This advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, as the original problem is related to a subquery returning multiple columns instead of one. However, the RESPONSE does not address the core of the issue, which is the incorrect setup of Q object aliases when OR'd, leading to the inclusion of all fields in the subquery and causing the 'subquery must return only one column' error.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which introduces a new method `get_group_by_cols` in the `django/db/models/lookups.py` file to handle the group by columns correctly when dealing with Q objects. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes to the Django ORM's internal handling of Q objects, which is what the git diff addresses.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to various code snippets in the Django repository, but these links do not directly contribute to solving the issue at hand and seem to be more of a general reference rather than actionable advice.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant because it touches on the subquery column issue but fails to provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific problem described in the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
