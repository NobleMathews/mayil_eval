    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns closely with the git diff. It suggests checking for `None` values and using `data.dropna(subset=[\"x\", \"y\"])` before fitting the polynomial, which is exactly what the git diff implements. The RESPONSE also offers additional advice on ensuring unique `x` values and having more data points than the polynomial order, which are good practices but not directly related to the git diff. The mention of considering an imputation technique or adjusting the `rcond` parameter provides alternative solutions that are not in the git diff but could be relevant in a broader context. The RESPONSE also includes links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
