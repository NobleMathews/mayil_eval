    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the file and class where the issue is located, which is `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` and `AuthenticationForm` respectively. It also accurately describes the need to set the `maxlength` attribute of the `username` field's widget to match the `max_length` of the field, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a code snippet that extends the `AuthenticationForm` and sets the `maxlength` attribute in the `__init__` method, which is similar to the approach taken in the git diff. The git diff modifies the `__init__` method directly to set the `maxlength` attribute, while the RESPONSE suggests subclassing and then modifying the `__init__` method, which is a valid alternative approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses points for not including the step of determining the `max_length` from the `username_field` as shown in the git diff. Instead, it assumes that the `max_length` is already set on the `username` field, which may not always be the case. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the fallback value of 254 for `max_length` as seen in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for further investigation, which is helpful but not directly related to the solution. The inclusion of the AdminAuthenticationForm is not necessary for solving the issue but does not detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
