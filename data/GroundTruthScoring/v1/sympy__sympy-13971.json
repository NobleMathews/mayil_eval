{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` output in Jupyter notebooks and pinpoints the relevant code in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. The suggested solution is to remove the `\\left` and `\\right` commands from the LaTeX string, which aligns with the git diff's approach of changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`. The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that would resolve the issue, although it suggests removing the commands entirely rather than correcting them as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes additional information about where to find the relevant code, which is helpful but not strictly necessary for fixing the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but offers a viable alternative that achieves the same result, hence it is scored a 7.",
