    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and precise instructions on how to implement the requested feature, which is to add a helper function called `make_and_validate_key` to the base cache backend class. It aligns perfectly with the git diff by suggesting the addition of the `make_and_validate_key` method in the `BaseCache` class and updating the existing code to use this new method, which is exactly what the git diff does.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes the exact Python code for the new method, which matches the git diff's changes. Furthermore, it instructs the developer to replace occurrences of `make_key` followed by `validate_key` with the new `make_and_validate_key` method across various cache backend classes, which is also reflected in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on updating unit tests and documentation, which, while not explicitly shown in the git diff, is an essential part of implementing new features and ensuring code quality. This advice is highly relevant and valuable for the developer to complete the task.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets in the repository, which could help the developer locate the files and code sections that need to be modified, although this is not a requirement for a perfect score, it shows thoroughness in the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is comprehensive, accurate, and provides actionable steps that are in complete alignment with the git diff, fulfilling all the criteria for a score of 10.",
