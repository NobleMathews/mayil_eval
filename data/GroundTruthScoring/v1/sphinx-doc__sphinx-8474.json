    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `_resolve_numref_xref` function in `sphinx/domains/std.py`, which is relevant to the issue and aligns with the git diff that modifies this exact function. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make, unlike the git diff which updates the warning message to be more informative.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking the `numfig` configuration and ensuring that tables have the proper `:name:` options set, which is not directly related to the git diff but could be considered general troubleshooting steps for `numref` issues. However, these suggestions do not address the specific warning message issue described in the original issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a suggestion to contribute a patch to improve the warning message, which is aligned with the git diff's approach to changing the warning message. However, it lacks the specificity of the git diff's actual change.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be related to the issue, but it does not offer actionable advice on what to do with these snippets, making this part of the RESPONSE not particularly helpful in resolving the issue.",
