    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a check for non-integer values of `q` before returning `S.Zero` for `p == q` or `p == -q`, which is in line with the git diff's intention to handle non-integer bases correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not accurately reflect the git diff's changes. The git diff specifically adds a condition to check if `p.exp.is_integer` and `q.is_integer` and if `p.exp.is_positive` when `p` is a power and `p.base == q`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a check for non-integer `q` before the `if p.is_integer and q == 1` check is somewhat relevant but does not address the specific logic for powers that is present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that does not match the git diff and suggests a new check that is not present in the git diff (`if not q.is_integer: return p % q`). While the RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that the `Mod` function correctly handles the case when `q` is a non-integer is relevant, it does not provide a solution that aligns closely with the git diff's approach. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and partially relevant.",
