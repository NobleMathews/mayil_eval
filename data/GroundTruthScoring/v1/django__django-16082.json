    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Mod` class and the `_resolve_output_field` method to handle the MOD operation correctly, which is a reasonable approach to the issue described. However, the git diff provided shows a change in the `expressions.py` file, specifically adding `Combinable.MOD` to a set of operators, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the actual change made in the git diff, which is to include the MOD operator in the set of operators that can be hashed. Instead, it focuses on modifying the `Mod` class and its method, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of resolving the output field for the MOD operator, but it does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it provides a somewhat relevant alternative solution but lacks alignment with the git diff.",
