    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. The RESPONSE suggests checking and modifying the '_resolve_group' function in 'xarray/core/groupby.py' and looking for changes between versions that might have affected the 'groupby' behavior. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes involve moving the 'safe_cast_to_index' function from 'xarray/core/utils.py' to 'xarray/core/indexes.py', adding a new function '_maybe_cast_to_cftimeindex', and updating various files to use the new location of 'safe_cast_to_index'. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these changes or provide guidance on how to implement them. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
