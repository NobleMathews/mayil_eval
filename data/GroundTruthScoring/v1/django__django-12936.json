    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described, which is that Subquery.__eq__() doesn't work properly for resolved subqueries.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the __eq__ method of the Subquery class to ensure it properly compares the relevant attributes of Subquery instances. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of subquery equality, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff does not modify the __eq__ method; instead, it changes the __init__ and __getstate__ methods to ensure that the queryset is not evaluated and that the state includes the correct constructor arguments for the subquery.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to recognize the specific changes made in the git diff, which are focused on preventing the evaluation of the queryset and preserving the correct state for comparison. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the __eq__ method does not address the root cause of the issue as identified in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
