    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating and ensuring correct behavior in various methods related to unit handling in the `ParasiteAxesBase` class and its subclasses. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by modifying the `_process_plot_var_args` class and its methods to remove the direct dependency on the `axes` attribute, and by passing the `axes` instance explicitly when these methods are called. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `_process_plot_var_args` class or its methods, nor does it suggest passing the `axes` instance explicitly. Instead, it provides a general investigation approach without specific instructions that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
