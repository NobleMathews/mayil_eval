    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue. It suggests checking if `pos1` and `pos2` are different and correctly formatted, which is not relevant to the issue since the problem is with the `plt.axes` function not incorporating the position data, not with the position data itself. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests using `set_position` instead of `set_axes`, which is not a valid method for `Axes` objects in Matplotlib and does not align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `axes` function to handle the `position` argument correctly by popping it from `kwargs` and using it to call `fig.add_axes` when it is provided. The RESPONSE fails to address this key aspect of the issue and does not provide a valid alternative solution. Therefore, it is not helpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
