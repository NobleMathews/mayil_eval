    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of the TypeError when calling `frac(zoo)`. It correctly identifies the need to handle `S.ComplexInfinity` (zoo) in the `frac` function and suggests returning `S.NaN` in this case, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly advises placing this check before other checks to prevent the TypeError due to `NoneType` operations. The RESPONSE does not cover the additional changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to comparison operators and the `_eval_is_*` methods, which are not directly related to the TypeError issue but are part of the overall improvements to the `frac` function. However, since the RESPONSE effectively addresses the core issue described, it is highly relevant and deserves a high score.",
