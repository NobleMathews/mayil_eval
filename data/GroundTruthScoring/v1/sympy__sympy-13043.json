{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `decompose()` function to return a sorted list when `separate=True`, which is a reasonable approach to ensure consistent ordering. However, the git diff indicates that the solution chosen by the repository's expert fixer was to return a set instead of a list, which inherently does not have an order and thus avoids the issue of arbitrary ordering altogether.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of using a set, and instead proposes sorting the list, which is a different solution. While sorting could be a valid approach, it does not match the git diff's chosen solution and does not address the possibility that the caller could handle the ordering if needed, as mentioned in the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes an import statement for `default_sort_key` and suggests using it as the sorting key. This is not reflected in the git diff, and it is not necessary for the solution proposed in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant alternative solution but does not closely match the git diff's approach and includes unnecessary steps. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
