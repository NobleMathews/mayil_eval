    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a custom decorator to ensure that the request object is an instance of `rest_framework.request.Request` and to extract the underlying Django `HttpRequest` object if necessary. This approach is different from the git diff, which modifies the existing decorators to check for the presence of the 'META' attribute instead of checking for an instance of `HttpRequest`. While the RESPONSE's suggestion could potentially resolve the issue, it does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the existing decorators. The RESPONSE's approach would require additional changes to the codebase to implement the custom decorator and apply it to each view, which is not reflected in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It provides an alternative solution but does not align with the simplicity and directness of the git diff's solution.",
