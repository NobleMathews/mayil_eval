{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate guide to implementing the feature of exporting a `Cosmology` to a LaTeX table using `Cosmology.write`. It correctly identifies the need to register a new I/O method for LaTeX and to implement the `write_latex` function. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests using `to_table` to convert the `Cosmology` instance to a `QTable` and formatting the table columns to LaTeX-friendly names. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use `QTable.write` with `format='latex'` to write the table to a LaTeX file is aligned with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a high-level overview of the implementation and a code snippet that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE's code snippet correctly includes the registration of the `write_latex` function with the `readwrite_registry` and the definition of the `_FORMAT_TABLE` dictionary, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific LaTeX formatting (e.g., using double dollar signs in the git diff versus single dollar signs in the RESPONSE), but this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative that achieves the same result as the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises including the registration of the writer in the `astropy/cosmology/io/__init__.py` file, which is necessary for the feature to be available upon importing the module. This matches the git diff's change to the `__init__.py` file.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and effectively addresses the issue described. It offers a viable alternative to the git diff's approach, which is why it receives a high score.",
