    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_eval_evalf` method in `sympy/core/function.py` to ensure that `evalf` is called recursively on the arguments of the function. The RESPONSE suggests using `arg.evalf(n=prec + 5)` for each argument in `self.args`, which is a slightly different approach than the git diff but achieves the same goal of recursively evaluating the arguments. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to relevant code snippets that could help in understanding and fixing the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, which uses `[i.evalf(prec) for i in self.args]` instead of `[arg.evalf(n=prec + 5) for arg in self.args]`. However, this difference is minor and does not significantly deviate from the intended solution. The RESPONSE's approach is still valid and would likely resolve the issue effectively. Therefore, it is scored a 9, as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
