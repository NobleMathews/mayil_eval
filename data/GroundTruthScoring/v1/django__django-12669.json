    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides an explanation of the `ORDER_PATTERN` and its purpose in Django's `order_by` method, which is relevant to the issue. However, it fails to offer actionable guidance or a solution that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the `ORDER_PATTERN` constant is removed, and instead, a more comprehensive validation logic is implemented directly in the `add_ordering` method. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ORDER_PATTERN` to include a hyphen and discusses the potential impact on database compatibility, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the deprecation warning for raw column aliases and the validation logic using `names_to_path`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
