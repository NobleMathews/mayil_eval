    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the feature of having separate defaults for create and update operations in Django's `update_or_create` method. It suggests adding an additional parameter `create_defaults` and using it for the creation of a new object, which aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also correctly handles the case where `create_defaults` is not provided by falling back to `defaults`, which is consistent with the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that closely matches the git diff, with the correct handling of `create_defaults` and `update_defaults`. The RESPONSE also correctly assumes the existence of `resolve_callables` and the behavior of `get_or_create`, which are present in the git diff. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not mention the asynchronous counterpart `aupdate_or_create`, which is also modified in the git diff to support `create_defaults`. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
