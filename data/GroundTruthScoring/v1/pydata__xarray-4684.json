    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring proper setting of `units` and `calendar` attributes, using `cftime.num2date` and `cftime.date2num` for conversions, specifying encoding explicitly, setting `decode_times` to `True`, updating libraries, verifying `dtype`, and comparing time values with `np.allclose`. While these are generally good practices for handling time data in xarray, they do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific code changes to the xarray library to handle nanosecond precision and avoid integer overflow issues, which are not addressed in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance on modifying the xarray codebase to fix the issue, nor does it suggest an alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that matches the git diff.",
