    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `floatformat` filter and creating a custom `intformat` filter to cast the float to an integer before passing it to the `blocktrans` tag. While this approach could potentially resolve the issue of string formatting with floats, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff adds a check within the Django template tag code to ensure that the value passed is a number (Decimal, float, or int) and raises a `TemplateSyntaxError` if it is not. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the Django code and instead proposes a workaround at the template level. This workaround may not be as robust as the solution in the git diff, which ensures that the error is caught and handled within the Django framework itself. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the need to handle the TypeError within the Django code, which is part of the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not fully address the issue described.",
