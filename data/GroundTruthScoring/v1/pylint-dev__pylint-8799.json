    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests profiling and reviewing the initialization process of `pylint`, optimizing the `lint_file` function, checking for default plugins, and ensuring the `--disable=all` flag is correctly propagated. However, these suggestions are generic and do not provide specific, actionable steps that align with the git diff, which shows a change in the `run.py` file to exit early if there are no files to lint or if all checks are disabled.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention the specific change in the `run.py` file, which is the core of the solution according to the git diff. Instead, it provides a broad set of actions that, while potentially helpful in a general performance investigation, do not directly address the issue of short-circuiting when all checks are disabled as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and lacks the specificity and relevance needed to assist the developer in fixing the issue. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
