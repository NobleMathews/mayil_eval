    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the core issue of inverting a log axis using its limits. The git diff shows that the problem is being addressed by checking if the limits are swapped and then reversing them if necessary, along with modifying the 'nonsingular' method to avoid singularities. The RESPONSE, however, suggests verifying the 'set_yscale' method and setting the limits with 'set_ylim', which is not the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance related to the changes shown in the git diff, such as handling swapped limits or modifying the 'nonsingular' method. The RESPONSE does provide a general approach to setting the y-axis to a log scale and inverting it, which is somewhat related to the issue, hence it receives a score of 1 instead of 0.",
