    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a conditional check at the beginning of the `draw_text` function to handle empty strings, which is a relevant and actionable piece of advice given the issue description. The proposed solution aims to prevent the error by returning early from the function if the text is empty or consists only of whitespace. This approach is different from the git diff but still addresses the underlying problem of handling empty lines in text labels.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff, which specifically adds a check to ensure that `curr_stream` is not empty before appending it to `stream`. The RESPONSE's alternative solution of checking the text at the beginning of the function could be effective, but it does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the `curr_stream` object.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of empty lines causing errors, but it does not provide a complete solution that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 for offering actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff but does not match it entirely.",
