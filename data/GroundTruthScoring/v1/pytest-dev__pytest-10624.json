    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are closely aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to investigate the `approx` function for division by zero issues when handling dictionaries with zero values, which is the core problem described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a check to prevent division by zero, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a condition to handle the case when the expected value is zero. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a guard clause is effectively implemented in the git diff by setting `max_rel_diff` to `math.inf` when the expected value is zero, preventing division by zero. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises adding tests to cover cases with zero values, which is a good practice, although it is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the use of `math.inf` specifically, which is a minor detail in the git diff, but the overall approach is still highly relevant and actionable.",
