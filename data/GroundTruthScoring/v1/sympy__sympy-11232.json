    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue with the `cse` function in Sympy, which is correct in identifying the problem with unevaluated subexpressions. However, the RESPONSE fails to offer specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It does not mention the changes made in the `cse_main.py` file, such as the introduction of the `pairwise_most_common` function, the modifications to the `opt_cse` function, or the adjustments to the `_match_common_args` function. The RESPONSE also does not address the changes in other files, such as `expr.py`, `matmul.py`, `llvmjitcode.py`, and `ode.py`, which are part of the git diff. The RESPONSE's suggestion to review and test various parts of the code is somewhat relevant but lacks the specificity and direct relevance to the git diff provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
