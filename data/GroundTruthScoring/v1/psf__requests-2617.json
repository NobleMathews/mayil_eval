    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'prepare_body' method in the 'requests/models.py' file to handle binary data appropriately. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the 'prepare_body' method. Instead, the git diff focuses on the 'prepare_method' function, where it adds a check for 'None' method and ensures the method is converted to a string and uppercased correctly. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of the method being 'None' or the conversion to a native string, which is a key part of the git diff's solution to the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to check if the 'data' parameter is an instance of 'bytes' before encoding, which is not related to the git diff or the issue described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses handling binary data, which is part of the issue context, but it fails to provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
