    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the `@pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True)` decorator to any `pytest_configure` hook implementations and modifying the `issue_deprecation_warning` function to include more information. However, the git diff shows that the actual solution involves wrapping the `warnings.warn_explicit` call in a try-except block to catch the `Warning` and raise it with additional location information. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue. The suggestion to modify a function that is not shown in the git diff (issue_deprecation_warning) is not relevant to the specific changes needed. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the need for more information in the warning, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
