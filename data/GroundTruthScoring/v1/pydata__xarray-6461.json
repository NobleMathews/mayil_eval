    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if `keep_attrs` is being correctly passed and handled within the `apply_ufunc` call and ensuring that the parameter is not altered or ignored. It also recommends investigating the implementation of `apply_ufunc` and `duck_array_ops.where` to support `keep_attrs` with scalar arguments. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of attribute handling, they do not directly address the specific problem described in the issue, which is an IndexError caused by attempting to access the second element of the `attrs` list when a scalar is passed as the second argument. The git diff shows that the solution involves changing the lambda function to return `getattr(x, \"attrs\", {})` instead of `attrs[1]`. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the lambda function or provide any guidance on handling the case when a scalar is passed as the second argument. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
