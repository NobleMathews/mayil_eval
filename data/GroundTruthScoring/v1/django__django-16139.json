{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests an alternative solution to the issue by checking if the instance has a UUID attribute and using it to format the password help text, otherwise defaulting to the primary key (pk). This approach is different from the git diff, which directly uses the instance's primary key without checking for a UUID. However, the RESPONSE's solution is still relevant and could be effective in a scenario where the UUID is used as a reference in the URL instead of the primary key. The RESPONSE provides actionable guidance and modifies the same line of code as the git diff, but with a conditional check for the UUID attribute. The RESPONSE also includes references to the relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer to understand the context of the changes. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, as it introduces an additional check for the UUID attribute, which was not part of the original issue description or the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a relevant and potentially effective alternative solution, but not aligning exactly with the git diff.",
