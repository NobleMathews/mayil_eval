    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive explanation of the issue and offers clear guidance on how to address it. It correctly identifies that the `on_delete` parameter must be a callable and not `None`, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a check to raise a `TypeError` if `on_delete` is not callable. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `ForeignKey` field definition to use a valid `on_delete` callable and provides a list of acceptable callables from `django.db.models`, which is helpful for developers. Additionally, it advises checking the Django documentation for the `on_delete` parameter, which is a good practice for developers to ensure they are using the parameter correctly. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which could be useful for developers to locate the relevant sections of code that may need updating. However, the RESPONSE does not explicitly mention adding a TypeError check as the git diff does, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. Nonetheless, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue.",
