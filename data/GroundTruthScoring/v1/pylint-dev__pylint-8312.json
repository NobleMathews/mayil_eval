    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement globbing pattern support for input specification in Pylint, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `config_initialization.py` file and to use the `glob` module to expand the glob patterns. The RESPONSE also suggests handling cases where the glob pattern does not match any files, which is a consideration present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's approach of using `chain.from_iterable` and the specific way of integrating the `glob` function into the existing code. Instead, it provides a high-level overview and a different code snippet that does not directly reflect the changes in the git diff. Despite this, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is still a valid and effective way to achieve the desired result of supporting glob patterns. Therefore, it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance, warranting a score of 7.",
