{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue, identifying the potential source of the IndexError within the `sylow_subgroup` method and suggesting a review of the `minimal_blocks` method. It correctly points out that the issue is likely related to list index access and recommends adding boundary checks to prevent the IndexError. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves changing the way non-minimal representative blocks are removed by using a mask, rather than deleting elements directly from the list, which could cause the IndexError. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or suggest a similar solution. It does, however, correctly identify the need to review the relevant lines of code and suggests testing with `DihedralGroup(18)` and `DihedralGroup(2*25)` to confirm the resolution of the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content that closely matches the git diff, hence a score of 4 is appropriate.",
