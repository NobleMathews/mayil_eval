    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `lens_makers_formula` function to handle additional cases for plano- and thick lenses, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable changes that align with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific implementation that includes a new parameter `d` for the lens thickness and an updated formula that accounts for this thickness. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a more complex approach involving different lens types and a conditional structure that is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the actual implementation of the formula for different lens types, which makes it less actionable. The RESPONSE also suggests further research, which is not directly helpful for implementing the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
