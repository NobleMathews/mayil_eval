{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are somewhat aligned with the git diff, suggesting to investigate and modify the `convert_units` method and `StrCategoryConverter.convert` to handle empty arrays correctly. This aligns with the git diff's approach to adding checks for empty data structures in the `convert` and `update` methods to prevent the deprecation warning from being raised incorrectly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not specifically mention the addition of the `values.size` check as seen in the git diff, which is the key change to address the issue. Instead, it provides a more general investigation approach without pinpointing the exact solution. The RESPONSE also includes additional steps that are not directly related to the git diff, such as checking for deprecation warnings and ensuring compatibility with Matplotlib version 3.5.1, which are good practices but not directly relevant to the specific changes needed to resolve the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's solution but offers a broader approach to investigating and resolving the issue. It is partially relevant and provides some actionable advice, but it lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff that would warrant a higher score.",
