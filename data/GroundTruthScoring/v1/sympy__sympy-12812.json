    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps to implement support for multivector fields of type (n,m) in the `diffgeom` package of SymPy, which is relevant to the issue described. It suggests extending the functionality of the `TensorProduct` class and modifying the `WedgeProduct` class, as well as updating utility functions like `covariant_order` and `contravariant_order`. These suggestions are in line with the git diff, which also modifies these classes and functions to support multivector fields.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed implementation guidance that directly aligns with the git diff. Instead, it offers a general approach and a rough sketch of a new class and modifications to existing functions. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a starting point for the developer, it lacks the actionable content and precise guidance present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets to check, which could be helpful for the developer to locate the relevant sections of the codebase. However, these links are not directly related to the actionable steps needed to resolve the issue, and the RESPONSE does not provide the specific changes shown in the git diff, such as the handling of `None` as an argument to vector fields or the adjustments to the text in the documentation.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and precise guidance that would closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
