    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is with the `from_db_value` not being called on insert operations for `MyAutoField` and provides a potential solution by overriding the `to_python` method and manually wrapping the values after `bulk_create`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows changes made to the `execute_sql` method in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file to ensure that database converters are called for `returning_fields` on insert operations. The RESPONSE does not address the changes in the git diff, such as the addition of `opts = self.query.get_meta()`, the restructuring of the conditional logic to store the result in `rows`, and the application of converters to the rows before returning them. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the same issue of database converters not being called, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
