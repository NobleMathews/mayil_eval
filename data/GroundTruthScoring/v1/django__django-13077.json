    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to handling the '.exe' extension issue on Windows, which is relevant to the problem described in the ISSUE. It correctly identifies the location of the code (`django/utils/autoreload.py`) and the function (`get_child_arguments`) that needs to be modified. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `.exe` extension is properly handled, which aligns with the git diff's addition of checks for the `.exe` extension and the `-script.py` suffix. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of `django_main_path`, `py_script`, and the detailed conditions for checking the existence of the executable and script entry points. It also does not mention raising a `RuntimeError` if the script does not exist, which is a part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a direction for the developer to investigate further, but it lacks the detailed actionable steps present in the git diff. Therefore, it is scored as a 4, indicating that it is incomplete and only partially relevant.",
