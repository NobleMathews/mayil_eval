{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `async_unsafe` decorator to check for an environment variable (`DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE`) before performing the async-unsafe check, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes additional steps such as updating documentation, adding system checks, and logging warnings, which are not part of the git diff but are relevant and useful for a complete implementation of the feature. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of code syntax (e.g., using `get_running_loop()` instead of `asyncio.get_event_loop()`), but the intent and outcome are the same. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a system check in `async_checks.py`, which is not part of the git diff but is a reasonable suggestion for a production environment. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it includes additional suggestions that are not part of the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
