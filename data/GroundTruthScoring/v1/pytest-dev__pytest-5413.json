    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `__str__` method of the `ExceptionInfo` object, which is what the git diff shows is being removed. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__str__` method to return the full error message by calling `str(self.value)`, which is a reasonable alternative to simply removing the method as the git diff does. This alternative approach would achieve the same result as the git diff, which is to ensure that `str(e)` behaves consistently within the `pytest.raises` context. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests modifying the method rather than removing it, but it is a valid and effective alternative approach. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests testing the changes, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the `__str__` method, which is a key action in the git diff, hence it does not score a perfect 10.",
