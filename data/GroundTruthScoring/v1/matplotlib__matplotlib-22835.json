    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing an `inverse` method in the `BoundaryNorm` class and handling the case when `inverse` returns `inf` or `-inf` in the `format_cursor_data` method. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff does not modify the `BoundaryNorm` class at all; instead, it adds a check within the `format_cursor_data` method to handle the case when `BoundaryNorm` is used, by avoiding the call to the non-existent `inverse` method and calculating the delta in a different way. The RESPONSE's suggestion to implement an `inverse` method is not supported by the git diff and does not address the issue in the same manner. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff and is not helpful in resolving the issue as described.",
