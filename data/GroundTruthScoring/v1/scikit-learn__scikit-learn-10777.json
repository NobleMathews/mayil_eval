    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a validation method `_validate_ngram_range` to the `__init__` method of the `CountVectorizer` class, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the `ngram_range` parameter is checked upon initialization of the object. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix implemented was to add a new method `_validate_params` and call it in the `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` methods, rather than modifying the `__init__` method. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific method name or the location where the validation is performed. Additionally, the RESPONSE refers to a non-existent `_validate_ngram_range` method, which does not align with the git diff that introduces `_validate_params`. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to validate `ngram_range`, but it does not provide the correct method or placement of the validation check as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the actual changes made to the code.",
