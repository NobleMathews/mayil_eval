    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement sample weights in the `partial_dependence` function, which is the core issue described. It suggests modifying the `_partial_dependence_brute` function to accept a `sample_weight` parameter and to compute the weighted average of predictions, which is in line with the git diff's addition of the `sample_weight` parameter to the `from_estimator` method and the associated logic for handling weighted averages.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `partial_dependence` function signature to include `sample_weight` and to pass it to the `_partial_dependence_brute` function. This matches the git diff's changes where the `sample_weight` parameter is added to the `from_estimator` method and passed through to the internal functions.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE advises on validating the `sample_weight` parameter using `_check_sample_weight`, which is a good practice, although this specific validation step is not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact functions and method signatures modified, but it does provide a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result, which is to respect sample weights in the `partial_dependence` calculations. The RESPONSE also includes a suggestion to update documentation and add unit tests, which are good practices but not part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue, although it does not match the git diff exactly in terms of the specific functions and lines of code to be changed.",
