    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the incorrect 'False' argument in the 'rotation_matrix' function call with 'units.radian' and ensuring that all calls to 'rotation_matrix' within 'nutation_matrix' pass angles with the correct unit, which should be radians. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix involves a more comprehensive update to the 'nutation_matrix' function, including the use of the 'erfa' library to compute the nutation matrix and the removal of the previous implementation that used 'rotation_matrix'. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the actual changes needed to resolve the issue. It does not provide any actionable guidance that would lead to the correct fix as per the git diff.",
