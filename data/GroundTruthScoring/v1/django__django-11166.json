{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting to modify the check in `django/contrib/admin/checks.py` to allow for alternative session management apps by checking for a subclass of `SessionMiddleware`. This is in line with the git diff, which removes the hard dependency on `django.contrib.sessions` and adds a check for the `SessionMiddleware` in the `MIDDLEWARE` settings.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `_contains_subclass` function usage, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting that the custom session middleware used in the project should be a subclass of Django's `SessionMiddleware` or that the check should be modified to recognize the custom middleware as valid.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes code snippets that are relevant to the issue and the proposed solution, further supporting the developer in locating the necessary code to modify.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific error code 'admin.E410' as seen in the git diff, but this is a minor detail that does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate as the RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and effectively addresses the issue.",
