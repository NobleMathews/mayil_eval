    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the queryset to group by the `email` field before slicing and using the `distinct` method on the `email` field. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of ensuring the correct `GROUP BY` clause, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates a change in the Django ORM's internal handling of subqueries with a limit, specifically modifying the `process_rhs` method to conditionally clear the select clause and add the 'pk' field only if no select fields are present. The RESPONSE does not address this internal handling or the modification of the `process_rhs` method, which is key to resolving the issue described. Instead, it provides an alternative way to construct the queryset from the user's perspective, which might not be a viable solution to the underlying problem in the Django ORM. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only given a score of 2 as it offers a somewhat relevant approach but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core issue.",
