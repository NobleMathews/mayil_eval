    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new parameter `allow_smaller_grid` to the `RandomizedSearchCV` constructor and modifying the `_run_search` method to handle the new logic. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of handling cases where `n_iter` is greater than the size of the parameter grid. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of changing the exception to a warning and adjusting `n_iter` to the grid size. Instead, it proposes a new feature that would require additional changes to the constructor and the `_run_search` method. While the RESPONSE is actionable and related to the issue, it does not closely match the git diff's solution and introduces a new feature rather than modifying the existing behavior. Therefore, it is only partially relevant and receives a score of 4.",
