    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests checking for the handling of complex numbers and ensuring safe tuple unpacking in various functions, but these suggestions do not align with the changes made in the git diff. The git diff specifically addresses the issue by ensuring that squares of terms are positive rationals before attempting to split surds or rationalize the denominator, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding checks for tuple lengths and handling of complex numbers in various functions, which is not related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides a list of code snippets to check, but this does not offer direct value in fixing the issue as it does not guide the developer towards the specific changes needed, as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide relevant or actionable guidance to assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
