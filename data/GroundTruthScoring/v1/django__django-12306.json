{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and a solution that closely aligns with the git diff, achieving a similar result.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `max` function call in the `_check_choices` method to include a default value of `0`, which aligns with the git diff's approach to handle the case when the generator is empty. The RESPONSE provides a code snippet that closely matches the git diff, with the only difference being the use of a `default=0` parameter instead of wrapping the arguments in a list. This alternative approach is valid and effectively addresses the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code section, which is helpful for the developer to locate the issue. The RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it introduces the `default=0` parameter, which is not present in the git diff, but this does not detract from the effectiveness of the solution.",
