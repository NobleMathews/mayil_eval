    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that aligns well with the git diff by suggesting the normalization of language codes to lowercase before comparison, which is consistent with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the `get_supported_language_variant` function in `trans_real.py` and provides a detailed code snippet that includes the use of `.lower()` to achieve case-insensitive comparison, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `get_languages` function that are present in the git diff, which includes converting the keys of the `settings.LANGUAGES` dictionary to lowercase. This omission means that the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff, as it does not address all the changes necessary to ensure case-insensitive handling of language codes throughout the system.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests updating the documentation, which is relevant to the issue but not reflected in the git diff provided. While this is a valuable suggestion, it does not directly impact the code changes required to fix the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not complete as it omits some changes and includes suggestions not present in the git diff. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
