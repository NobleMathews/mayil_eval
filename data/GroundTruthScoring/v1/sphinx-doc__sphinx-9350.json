    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file (`sphinx/writers/manpage.py`) where the issue likely resides and correctly suggests that the handling of inline nodes or the lack of a reset for font changes after a `:samp:` directive could be the problem. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the handling of nodes in the `sphinx/writers/manpage.py` file.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable changes that match the git diff. Instead, it suggests examining and potentially modifying the `visit_inline` and `depart_inline` methods, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff shows changes in the handling of nodes by reversing the list of nodes, removing them, and then conditionally reinserting them or their new instances, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the specific logic added in the git diff, such as moving a node if all children became siblings of the node. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by identifying the correct file and the general area of the problem, it does not provide the specific actionable steps present in the git diff. It is partially relevant but incomplete, warranting a score of 4.",
