    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a workaround for the issue of overlapping labels in seaborn's relplot by adjusting the facet_kws to prevent axis sharing, shortening the col_template, and modifying the ticklabel_format. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which shows a change in the seaborn library code itself to handle the case where variable names are None. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the seaborn code that the git diff aims to fix. Instead, it provides a user-level workaround that might mitigate the symptom but does not resolve the root cause. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of overlapping labels, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
