    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `SubThing` model's `ForeignKey` definition and the `Thing` model's `id` field configuration, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically addresses a condition in the `add_fields` method of the `django/forms/models.py` file, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide a solution that would prevent the `id` field from being set to `null` when adding a `SubThing` inline in the admin, which is the core of the issue described. The RESPONSE does provide some general advice on model configuration and migration, which is tangentially related to the issue but does not address the specific bug. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are relevant to the issue, but the RESPONSE itself does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or effectively resolves the issue.",
