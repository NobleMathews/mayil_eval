    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the developer should explicitly define the `Meta` class with the desired `ordering` attribute in the `Child` model, which is a reasonable suggestion in general Django practice. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the Django framework's internal handling of default ordering for related models. The git diff specifically addresses a bug in the Django ORM where the primary key shortcut 'pk' is not respected when inheriting the default ordering from a parent model. The RESPONSE does not address this bug or provide a solution that would fix the underlying issue in the Django framework itself. Instead, it suggests a workaround that may not be suitable if the developer intends for the `Child` model to inherit the `Parent` model's ordering. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix required, as they do not pertain to the specific change made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses ordering issues in Django models, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue described.",
