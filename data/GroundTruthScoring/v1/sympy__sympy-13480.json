    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue as a typo or reference to an undefined variable 'cotm' in the code, which aligns with the git diff that corrects 'cotm' to 'cothm'. The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution by suggesting to locate the line with the error, check for any reference to 'cotm', and replace it with the correct variable 'cothm'. It also recommends ensuring that the 'coth' function is properly defined and imported, which is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE further advises testing the substitution with the integral values mentioned to ensure the error is resolved, which is a good practice for verifying the fix. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's exact change but offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result, which is to correct the typo and resolve the NameError. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively.",
