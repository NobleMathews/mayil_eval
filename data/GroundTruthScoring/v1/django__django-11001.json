    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the regular expression pattern `self.ordering_parts` to handle multiline SQL statements, which is the core of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `seen` set logic to consider the entire SQL statement, which is in line with the git diff's intent to ensure proper identification of duplicates. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a recommendation to test the changes with multiline `RawSQL` expressions, which is a good practice though not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact regex pattern or the specific flags (`re.MULTILINE | re.DOTALL`) used in the git diff, but the overall guidance is highly relevant and would lead the developer towards a similar solution. The inclusion of code snippet references is helpful for locating the relevant sections of code, although the git diff does not mention these explicitly. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the addition of comments as seen in the git diff, but this is a minor aspect and does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE.",
