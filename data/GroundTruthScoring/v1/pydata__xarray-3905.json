    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of truncating the string representation of `DataArray` objects in xarray after a certain number of lines. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `short_data_repr` function and to use the `limit_lines` function with a line limit of 40, which is in line with the git diff's addition of the `limit_lines` function and its usage in `short_data_repr`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes the correct code snippet to be modified, which matches the git diff's changes to the `short_data_repr` function. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides extra context by pointing to relevant code snippets in the repository that may need to be considered when implementing the truncation logic.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the actual implementation of the `limit_lines` function, which is a key part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE does guide the developer to modify the `short_data_repr` function and use `limit_lines`, it assumes the existence of the `limit_lines` function without providing its implementation. This is why the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score.",
