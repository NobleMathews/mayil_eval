    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py` to handle type hints and default values correctly, which is aligned with the git diff's changes to the same file. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance on how to implement these changes, nor does it mention the new utility functions added in `pylint/pyreverse/utils.py` that are crucial for handling type hints and annotations. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `__init__` method of class `C`, which is not relevant to the issue as the problem lies within the pyreverse tool, not the user's code. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests implementing a method in `Linker` or `project_from_files`, which is not supported by the git diff and is not relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE fails to address the changes made to `pylint/pyreverse/writer.py`, which are essential for the correct representation of type hints in the UML output. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear path to achieving the expected behavior described in the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
