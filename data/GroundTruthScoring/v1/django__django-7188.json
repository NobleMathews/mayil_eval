    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of steps to decouple authentication components from the requirement of having `django.contrib.auth` in `INSTALLED_APPS`. It suggests modifying `AuthenticationMiddleware`, updating the `auth` context processor, ensuring dynamic loading of the user model, and writing tests. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a refactoring of the `AuthConfig` class into a `BaseAuthConfig` and an `AuthConfig` class, with the latter inheriting from the former. The RESPONSE does not mention or address this refactoring approach. Instead, it focuses on modifying middleware and context processors, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of decoupling auth components but fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score for not closely aligning with the git diff but still offering a somewhat relevant alternative approach.",
