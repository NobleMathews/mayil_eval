    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a common test function for multi-output support and adding it to the appropriate test generators, which is relevant to the ISSUE that discusses the lack of common tests for multi-output classifiers and regressors. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which includes specific changes to the codebase, such as adding a `_more_tags` method to several classes to indicate that they do not support multioutput and modifying the inheritance of some classes to reflect their multioutput capabilities.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of `MultiOutputMixin` from certain classes and the addition of the `_more_tags` method. Instead, it focuses on creating a new common test function and updating test generators, which, while related to the ISSUE, do not reflect the specific changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests removing redundant individual tests, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but does not provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It offers a different approach to addressing the ISSUE, which is not supported by the git diff, and therefore receives a score of 3.",
