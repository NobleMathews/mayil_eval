    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable advice on how to address the issue with the `separability_matrix` function not computing separability correctly for nested `CompoundModels`. It suggests modifying the `_separable` function and ensuring that the operators handle the combination of separability matrices from nested `CompoundModels` correctly. Additionally, it recommends adding unit tests for various nested `CompoundModels`. The RESPONSE also includes a potential update to the `_separable` function, which is not directly related to the git diff provided but could be seen as an alternative approach to solving the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff, which is a one-line change in the `_cstack` function where a matrix is being correctly assigned instead of being set to 1. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check and update the `_cstack` function is somewhat aligned with the git diff, but it does not pinpoint the exact change needed. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
