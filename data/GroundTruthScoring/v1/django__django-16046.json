    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests checking if `str_number` is `None` or an empty string before attempting to access its first character, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a check for `number` being `None` or an empty string. The RESPONSE also offers a clear guidance to modify the `format_number_for_admin` function to handle `None` or empty strings appropriately, which is in line with the git diff's intent to handle such cases to avoid the 'string index out of range' error.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, as it suggests returning \"N/A\" for null or empty strings, while the git diff uses `mark_safe(number)` to return the original `number` value safely. Additionally, the RESPONSE refers to a function `format_number_for_admin` which is not present in the git diff, indicating that the RESPONSE may be suggesting a change in a different part of the code or a different approach altogether. The RESPONSE also includes a link to code snippets that may contain the problematic code, which is helpful but not directly related to the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, but it does not match the git diff exactly and introduces a different return value and function name. Therefore, it scores a 7.",
