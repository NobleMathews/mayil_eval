    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `post` function in `wimp.py` to catch `socket.timeout` and raise `requests.exceptions.Timeout` instead. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix involves changes to the `requests` library itself, specifically in `requests/compat.py` and `requests/models.py`. The RESPONSE does not address the changes in the `requests` library and instead focuses on a workaround in the user's code, which does not align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests importing `socket.timeout`, which is contrary to the git diff that removes the import of `socket` and `IncompleteRead`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of `ReadTimeoutError` and `ProtocolError` exceptions, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
