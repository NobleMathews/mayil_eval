    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the use of `LooseVersion` with `pkg_resources.parse_version` in the `minversion` function and modifying the comparison logic accordingly. This is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of using a regex to sanitize the version string before comparison. The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by giving a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the suggested changes. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which retains the use of `LooseVersion` but adds a regex to strip non-numeric pre-release segments before comparison. The RESPONSE also does not address the potential need to add a dependency on `pkg_resources` or handle any compatibility issues that may arise from this change. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for context, which is helpful but not directly related to the fix itself. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it offers a different solution to the same problem, but it does not match the git diff's approach and lacks consideration of the broader implications of the suggested change.",
