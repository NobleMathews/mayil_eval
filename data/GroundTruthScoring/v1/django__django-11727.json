    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable guide to implement the feature of hiding the \"Save and Add Another\" button using a `show_save_and_add_another` context variable. It aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the addition of the `show_save_and_add_another` variable in the `submit_row` function and updating the context accordingly. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating the template to respect the new context variable, which is in line with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE goes further to provide an example of how to pass the `show_save_and_add_another` variable in the `extra_context` when rendering the admin form, which is not directly shown in the git diff but is a necessary step for the feature to work as intended. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it offers a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result. Therefore, it receives a high score for its relevance and utility in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
