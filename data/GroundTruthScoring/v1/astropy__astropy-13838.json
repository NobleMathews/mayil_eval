    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking for empty arrays in the 'C' field and replacing them with a non-empty array with a default value before passing it to `QTable`. This suggestion does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `_pformat_col_iter` function to handle zero dimensions within the table formatting code itself, rather than altering the input data.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `QTable` class to handle empty arrays gracefully, which is closer to the approach taken in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement this change, nor does it mention the need to handle zero dimensions as the git diff does.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to various code snippets in the repository, but these are not directly related to the issue at hand. The git diff specifically addresses the problem within the `pprint.py` file, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
