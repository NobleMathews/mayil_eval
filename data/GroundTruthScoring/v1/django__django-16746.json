    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code snippet that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the Paginator class to accept custom error messages and support internationalization, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the use of Django's built-in gettext function for marking error messages for translation, which is implicit in the use of the gettext_lazy as _ in the git diff. The RESPONSE's code snippet for merging custom error messages with the default ones uses a different syntax ({**self.default_error_messages, **(error_messages or {})}), but it achieves the same result as the git diff's approach (self.default_error_messages | error_messages). The RESPONSE also correctly advises on raising exceptions with the appropriate error message in the validate_number method using self.error_messages, which is in line with the git diff. The only minor discrepancy is the RESPONSE's use of a different merging syntax, which is still a valid alternative and does not impact the functionality. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 9.",
