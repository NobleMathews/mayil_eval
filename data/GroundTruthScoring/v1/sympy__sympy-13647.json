    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are generally relevant to debugging and fixing an issue with the `Matrix.col_insert` method. It suggests checking the implementation for issues, verifying that the method handles insertion index and dimensions correctly, updating internal representations, reviewing recent refactors, writing a test case, and fixing the implementation if a bug is found.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change shown in the git diff, which corrects the index used in the return statement of the `entry` function within the `Matrix.col_insert` method. The RESPONSE's general advice to check the implementation and write test cases is somewhat aligned with the process of fixing the issue but does not provide the specific actionable guidance that matches the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to adjust the index calculation, which is the core of the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader context of fixing a method that is not working correctly, but it lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff that would warrant a higher score. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
