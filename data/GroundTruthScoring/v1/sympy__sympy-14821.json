    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a direct solution to the issue by suggesting a modification to the `_print_zeta` method in the `sympy/printing/octave.py` file, which is the correct file and method that needs to be changed according to the git diff. The proposed code change effectively addresses the problem by checking the number of arguments and swapping them if there are two, which is exactly what is needed to fix the issue of incorrect code generation for the two-argument zeta function in Octave. The RESPONSE also provides the correct code snippet, which is not only actionable but also aligns perfectly with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
