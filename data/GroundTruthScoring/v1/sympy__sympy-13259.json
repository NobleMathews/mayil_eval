    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking various parts of the codebase for potential issues with handling complex arguments in trigonometric functions. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described. The RESPONSE mentions checking the `exptrigsimp` and `exp_trig` functions, which are not part of the git diff provided. It also suggests verifying the correctness of the rewrite rules in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` and `sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py`, which is somewhat relevant since the git diff includes changes to these files. However, the RESPONSE fails to mention the introduction of the `_peeloff_ipi` function or the modifications to the `eval` methods of the hyperbolic and trigonometric functions, which are key elements of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide clear instructions on how to implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue, and it does not reflect the specific changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
