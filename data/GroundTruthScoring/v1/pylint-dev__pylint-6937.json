    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps to verify and potentially fix the issue with the `--disable` flag being ignored when `--errors-only` is specified. It suggests checking the implementation of the `--disable=E0401` flag, ensuring that `--errors-only` is not overriding the `--disable` behavior, and investigating any precedence issues in the argument parsing logic. These steps are actionable and relevant to the issue described.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the help message for the `--errors-only` option and a refactoring of the `disable_noerror_messages` method to disable message categories other than `error` and `fatal`. The RESPONSE does not mention updating help messages or refactoring methods, which are key elements of the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a general direction for troubleshooting and fixing the issue, which is why it receives a score within the 4-6 range. It does not, however, provide specific guidance on the changes needed as shown in the git diff, which would be necessary for a higher score.",
