    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the feature request for supporting specific `:private-members:` in autodoc, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the `option_spec` to accept a list of member names and updating the logic for processing the `:private-members:` option. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a deprecation warning being added, a new function `merge_members_option` being introduced, and changes to the handling of private members within the `is_filtered_inherited_member` function. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific changes, nor does it suggest deprecating existing functionality or refactoring the handling of member options. Instead, it focuses on modifying existing functions and option specifications, which is only partially relevant to the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and references to files that are not present in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
