    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to respect the `--check` flag by exiting with a non-zero status code when changes are detected, without writing the migrations to the disk. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `makemigrations` command to include a check that uses `sys.exit(1)` when the `--check` flag is set and changes are detected, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises against calling `self.write_migration_files(changes)` when the `--check` flag is used, which is also reflected in the git diff where the call to `self.write_migration_files(changes)` is moved after the `sys.exit(1)` condition. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the codebase, which would be very helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that the RESPONSE suggests adding a condition `if check_changes and changes: sys.exit(1)` which is not necessary as the git diff already handles the `check_changes` condition appropriately without checking for `changes` explicitly.",
