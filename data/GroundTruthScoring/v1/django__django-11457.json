    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_resolve_output_field` method to include the `repr()` of the expression and use the actual class name in the error message, which aligns with the issue's request for more informative exceptions. However, the RESPONSE specifies the `CombinedExpression` class, while the git diff modifies the `expressions.py` file without specifying a particular class. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the error message to include information about what types were found and which were unexpected is in line with the git diff, which adds a more detailed error message including class names. The RESPONSE also suggests setting `output_field` to a specific field type when mixed types are encountered, which is a reasonable interpretation of the issue's request for a more concrete explanation of what the output_field should be. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the exact implementation of the error message and the inclusion of the `repr()` of the expression. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to ensure that the `__repr__` method in `CombinedExpression` returns a string that accurately represents the instance, which is not addressed in the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant, warranting a score of 4.",
