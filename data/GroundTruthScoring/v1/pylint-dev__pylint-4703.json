    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the Pylint configuration file or adding comments to disable the cyclic-import warning, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the source code of Pylint itself, specifically in the `imports.py` file, to handle cyclic imports within `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks more gracefully. The RESPONSE does not address the code changes in the git diff and instead offers a workaround that suppresses the warning rather than fixing the underlying issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
