    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests changing the signature of `make_column_transformer` to match `ColumnTransformer` by using `(name, transformer, columns)` tuples, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff instead adds a deprecation warning for the old tuple order and changes the internal handling to support the new `(transformer, columns)` order without including the `name`. The RESPONSE does not address the deprecation process or the internal changes needed to support the new order.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the function signature to include the `name` in the tuple, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows that the `name` is generated internally using `_name_estimators(transformers)` and is not part of the input tuple. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the deprecation warning or the helper functions `_validate_transformers` and `_is_deprecated_tuple_order` that are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also does not reflect the change in the docstring examples to match the new tuple order. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff and is only partially relevant to the ISSUE.",
