    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and a rough implementation outline for addressing the issue of making the parallel test runner work with the `spawn` process start method on Windows/macOS. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff includes specific changes to the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py` file and the `django/utils/autoreload.py` file, which are not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `django.test.runner._init_worker` function and the `setup_worker_connection` method, but it does not provide the correct details or code changes that match the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a link to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the actual changes needed. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the issue of setting up the app registry and database connections for worker processes, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
