    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement weighted KDE in the `KernelDensity` class, which is the core of the issue described. It suggests modifying the `KernelDensity` class to accept `sample_weight` as an optional parameter, updating the `fit` method to handle the weights, and adjusting the kernel density estimation calculation to incorporate the weights. These suggestions are in line with the changes made in the git diff, which also adds a `sample_weight` parameter to the `fit` method, checks the weights, and modifies the density estimation and sampling methods to account for the weights.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes. For example, it suggests adding `sample_weight` to the `__init__` method of the `KernelDensity` class, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a pseudo-code snippet for a `_compute_density` method that does not exist in the actual codebase, and it does not provide the exact changes to the `score_samples` and `sample` methods as shown in the git diff.\n\nDespite these differences, the RESPONSE's suggestions are relevant and would lead to a similar outcome as the git diff, which is to enable weighted KDE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is valuable and provides actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
