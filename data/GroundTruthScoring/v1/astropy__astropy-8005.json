    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns well with the git diff. It suggests updating the `thermodynamic_temperature` function to use the default cosmology for the `T_cmb` parameter, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to import `default_cosmology` and to use `default_cosmology.get().Tcmb0` when `T_cmb` is `None`. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on ensuring consistency across the codebase, which is relevant to the issue's concern about inconsistent use of cosmologies. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes to the example code and comments in the git diff, but these are not central to the issue's main concern. The RESPONSE also includes an unnecessary suggestion to update the `with_H0` function, which is not part of the issue or the git diff, but this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
