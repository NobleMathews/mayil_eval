    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring the Python environment is configured to handle Unicode correctly and modifying the `pytest.raises` assertion to handle Unicode characters, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of Unicode match assertions with pytest.raises in Python 2. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the code where the value is converted to a text type if the regular expression is a text type, and then an `AssertionError` is raised with a formatted message if the pattern is not found. The RESPONSE does not mention any code changes or the approach taken in the git diff, such as the conversion of the value based on the type of the regular expression or the raising of an `AssertionError`. Instead, it suggests setting the default encoding to UTF-8, which is not reflected in the git diff and could potentially lead to other issues when modifying the default encoding globally. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, hence the score of 2.",
