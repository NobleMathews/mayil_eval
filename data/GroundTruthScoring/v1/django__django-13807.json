    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `check_constraints` function to properly quote the table name using double quotes, which is in line with the git diff's approach of using `self.ops.quote_name` to ensure proper quoting of table names. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the issue is with the improper quoting of table names, which is the root cause as described in the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not use the `self.ops.quote_name` method as shown in the git diff, which is the Django-specific way of quoting identifiers. Instead, it suggests directly using double quotes in the string formatting, which might not be as robust as using the provided method. This could lead to potential issues if the `quote_name` method includes additional logic for quoting that is not captured by simply wrapping the name in double quotes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional guidance to ensure that all instances of table name interpolation in SQL queries within the SQLite backend use double quotes for consistency. This is a good practice, but it is not directly reflected in the git diff, which focuses on the specific instances within the `check_constraints` function.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach, but it does not match it exactly due to the difference in quoting method used. Therefore, it scores a 7.",
