    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `extract_multiplicatively` method to handle negative factors correctly, which is relevant to the issue. However, the proposed solution does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff includes a more comprehensive set of changes, such as importing `_coeff_isneg`, handling cases where `c.is_Add`, and restructuring the logic for when `self.is_Add`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a simple check after `quotient = self / c` is not sufficient to address the issue as described and does not incorporate the necessary logic to handle the various cases outlined in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the correct code snippet to fix the issue, as it does not match the git diff's changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
