    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue described, which involves a warning about the 'max' function not being known to astropy's Quantity. The RESPONSE suggests checking if `astropy.units.Quantity` has a `max` method implemented, which is directly related to the git diff that adds `np.max` to the list of known functions. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `numpy.testing.assert_equal` can handle `astropy.units.Quantity` objects correctly, which is a reasonable step given the context of the issue involving a test assertion. The RESPONSE also advises checking for changes in `numpy-dev` that might affect the interaction with `Quantity`, which is a valid consideration given the warning appears with `numpy-dev`. The RESPONSE further recommends checking the test for correct exception handling and considering pinning the `numpy` version if needed, which are practical steps in troubleshooting CI test failures. The RESPONSE does not directly mention modifying the list of known functions as the git diff does, but it does suggest ensuring that `Quantity` interacts correctly with `numpy` functions, which is aligned with the intent of the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that could be relevant to the issue, which is helpful for a developer looking to fix the problem.",
