    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new private method `_get_max_batch_size` to calculate the maximum batch size and modifying the `bulk_create` method to use this new method. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it aims to ensure the `batch_size` does not exceed the maximum size supported by the database backend. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the issue as described, which is that the `batch_size` parameter should not override the compatible batch size calculation. Instead of modifying the existing `_batched_insert` method as the git diff does, the RESPONSE introduces a new method and changes the structure of the code. While the RESPONSE's approach could be a valid alternative, it is more complex and deviates from the simplicity of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff but offers a partial solution to the issue.",
