{
    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a workaround for handling the evaluation and simplification of expressions manually in SymPy, specifically when dealing with the `ceiling` function. However, the git diff provided shows changes to the `_eval_is_integer` method in the `sympy/core/mul.py` file, which is unrelated to the issue of inconsistent behavior with `sympify` and `simplify`. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as removing the import of `fuzzy_and`, refactoring the `_eval_is_integer` method, and the logic related to handling numerators and denominators. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue described. As a result, it should be scored as 0.",
