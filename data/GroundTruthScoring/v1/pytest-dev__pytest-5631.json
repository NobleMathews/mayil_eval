    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the condition `p.new in sentinels` to handle NumPy arrays correctly, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff does not modify the condition to handle NumPy arrays but instead changes the way sentinels are checked by using `getattr` to safely get the `DEFAULT` attribute from the `mock` and `unittest.mock` modules and then compares `p.new` to these sentinels using identity checks. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippets and does not address the specific changes made in the git diff. Therefore, it does not provide actionable guidance that would help the developer fix the issue as per the git diff.",
