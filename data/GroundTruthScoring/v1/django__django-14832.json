    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `floatformat` filter to accept and use the `use_l10n` parameter from the template context, and to update the `LocalizeNode` to set the `use_l10n` value in the context. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the handling of the `arg` parameter to support a 'u' suffix for unlocalized output and directly updating the calls to `formats.number_format()` to include the `use_l10n` parameter based on the presence of 'u' or 'g' in the `arg`. The RESPONSE does not mention handling the 'u' suffix or modifying the `arg` parameter, and it introduces the idea of using the template context, which is not present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue as described.",
