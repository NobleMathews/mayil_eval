    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying if there is an existing configuration option to control the indexing of attributes and modifying the `sphinxcontrib-napoleon` extension code if necessary. While this is a reasonable approach, it does not provide specific, actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the code was modified to check for the 'noindex' option within the `_parse_attributes_section` and `_parse_methods_section` methods and to add the ':noindex:' tag if it is present. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying these specific methods or adding the ':noindex:' tag, which are the key actions needed to resolve the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue but does not offer direct guidance on what changes to make within those snippets. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
