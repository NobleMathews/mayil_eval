    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the feature of using the index directive as a source for the search engine in Sphinx, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the search index builder to include index entries, updating the search functionality, and implementing result boosting. The RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code snippet to illustrate the changes to the search index builder, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach to adding index entries to the search index.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff shows actual code modifications to the `SearchLanguage` class, including the addition of the `_index_entries` dictionary and the logic to process index entries from `addnodes.index` nodes in the `feed` method. The RESPONSE's pseudo-code does not reflect these specific changes and lacks the detailed implementation that is present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the JavaScript search algorithm, which is not covered in the git diff, and it does not mention the `split_into` utility function used in the git diff to handle different types of index entries.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff's approach and is incomplete in addressing the specific changes required to implement the feature.",
