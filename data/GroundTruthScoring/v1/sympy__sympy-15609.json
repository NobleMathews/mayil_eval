{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely matches the git diff. It suggests modifying the '_print_MatrixElement' method in the 'sympy/printing/latex.py' file, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use curly braces '{}' around the indices to prevent double subscript errors, aligning with the git diff's approach of formatting the indices with '_print' method calls within curly braces. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's syntax (using '.format' instead of string concatenation), but this difference is stylistic and does not affect the correctness of the solution. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. However, it does not score a 10 because it includes unnecessary references to other parts of the code that are not directly related to the fix, such as the '_print_MatrixSymbol' method and the 'MatrixElement' class, which could potentially distract from the specific issue at hand.",
