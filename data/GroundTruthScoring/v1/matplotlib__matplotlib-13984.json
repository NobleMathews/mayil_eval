    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows changes in the 'axis3d.py' file where the color setting for tick marks is removed, indicating that the color should not be set in this manner. Instead, the git diff suggests using the 'rcParams' configuration for setting the linewidth without specifying the color directly. The RESPONSE, however, suggests using 'set_color' on the axis line objects to change the color of the tick marks, which is not supported by the git diff and does not resolve the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that does not reflect the changes in the git diff and would not fix the issue of tick mark colors not being settable. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful or misguided and offers no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
