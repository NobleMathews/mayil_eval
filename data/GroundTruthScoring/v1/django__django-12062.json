    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `MigrationLoader` class and the test runner setup to respect a new `MIGRATE` setting in the database configuration. While this approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `create_test_db` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` and the `prepare_test_settings` method in `django/db/utils.py`, where it adds a default for the `MIGRATE` setting and checks this setting before running migrations during test database creation. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying these specific methods or files and instead focuses on a different approach involving the `MigrationLoader` class, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to respect a `MIGRATE` setting, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and therefore does not provide a high level of utility in assisting a developer to fix the issue as described.",
