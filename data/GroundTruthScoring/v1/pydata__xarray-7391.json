    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice and partially match the git diff but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the `keep_attrs` option is not being respected in `Dataset` binary operations and that the relevant code is in the `_binary_op` method. However, the RESPONSE suggests passing the `keep_attrs` parameter to `_calculate_binary_op` and ensuring it is handled there, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding code after the `_calculate_binary_op` call to check the `keep_attrs` setting and then conditionally preserving the attributes. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach but instead focuses on modifying the `_calculate_binary_op` method, which is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not provide a complete solution aligned with the git diff.",
