    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the issue with the `srepr` function not printing `dict` and `set` correctly and suggests modifying the `srepr` function to handle these types. It provides a hypothetical solution that is conceptually similar to the git diff, which involves adding cases to handle `dict` and `set`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable code changes that align with the git diff. Instead, it offers a general approach without specific implementation details and includes irrelevant links to various parts of the SymPy library that do not directly address the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it identifies the correct file and function to modify but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff's approach of adding specific `_print_dict` and `_print_set` methods.",
