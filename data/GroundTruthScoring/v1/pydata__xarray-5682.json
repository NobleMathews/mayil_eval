    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `long_name` attribute is set correctly and using `matplotlib` functions to set the labels, which is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not address the core problem of LaTeX expressions not being rendered correctly by `xarray`. The RESPONSE does not provide any code changes or specific guidance on how to modify the `xarray` plotting functionality to handle LaTeX expressions, which is what the git diff does by adding a condition to treat LaTeX sequences differently. The RESPONSE also suggests updating `xarray` and `matplotlib` and checking the LaTeX installation, which are general troubleshooting steps but do not align with the git diff's approach to solving the issue. The RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it offers some general advice that could be somewhat helpful but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue of LaTeX rendering in `xarray` plots.",
