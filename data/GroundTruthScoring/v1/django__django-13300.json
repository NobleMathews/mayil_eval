    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'Exists' class in 'django/db/models/expressions.py' to change the queryset to select a single value (1) instead of all fields. However, the git diff provided does not show any changes to the 'as_sql' method or the use of 'Value(1)' as suggested in the RESPONSE. Instead, the git diff indicates that the 'Exists' class constructor should not modify the queryset ordering and that the 'query' attribute should be set to use the 'exists' method from the 'Query' class. Additionally, the git diff shows changes to the 'has_results' method in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' and the 'exists' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py', which are not addressed in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. It provides an alternative solution that is not supported by the git diff and does not address the changes made in the 'compiler.py' and 'query.py' files. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of optimizing the 'Exists' subquery to use 'SELECT 1', but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2.",
