    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the code that uses the `set_dashes` method to provide a valid dash pattern or use a predefined line style. While this advice could be seen as a workaround for the user's code, it does not address the underlying issue in the Matplotlib library that caused the regression. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `set_dashes` method in the Matplotlib library to handle the case where an empty dash tuple is provided. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the need to change the library code and instead suggests the user change their code, which does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix required, as the actual change needs to be made in 'backend_bases.py', not in 'lines.py' or 'py_converters.cpp'. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it acknowledges the error message but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
