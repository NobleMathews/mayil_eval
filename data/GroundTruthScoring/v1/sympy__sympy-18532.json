    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `atoms()` method to return objects with no `.args` property, which aligns with the git diff's change to return nodes with no arguments. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to maintain performance, which is a concern mentioned in the issue. However, the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions such as using caching or memoization and creating the `atoms()` method if it does not exist, which are not reflected in the git diff. These extra suggestions do not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE but are not necessary according to the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation of using a set comprehension, which is present in the git diff, but this does not significantly reduce the value of the RESPONSE as the core issue is addressed effectively.",
