    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to resolving the issue of having two versions of the Django admin script installed, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, it does not align with the git diff's approach of adding a deprecation warning and raising an ImportError if the deprecated script is used. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the setup.py file to install only one script and provides alternative solutions that are not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the confusion caused by having two scripts, it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's specific solution. The RESPONSE does not mention adding deprecation warnings or handling the ImportError, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
