    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of checks and suggestions to ensure that the `coef_` attribute is correctly shaped when `fit_intercept=False`. It suggests modifying the `fit` method if necessary and checking the handling of the `fit_intercept` parameter, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or directly address the changes shown in the git diff, such as setting `self.coef_` and `self.dual_gap_` based on the condition of `n_targets`. Instead, it offers a more general approach to debugging the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the same issue, but it lacks the specificity and directness of the git diff's solution. Therefore, it is scored as a 4, indicating that it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
