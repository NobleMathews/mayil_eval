    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_iter_rewritable_modules` function to handle both `dist-info` and `egg-info` directories, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a clear, actionable solution that aligns with the git diff. The git diff includes a detailed implementation that deals with the problem by checking for the presence of a '/' in the filename, handling `setup.py` specifically, and considering the possibility of a 'src' based source tree. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a different approach that involves checking for metadata keys 'Provides-Dist' and 'Provides-Egg', which is not present in the git diff and does not address the issue in the same way. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippets and links that do not contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
