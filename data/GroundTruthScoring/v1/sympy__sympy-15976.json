    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the handling of variable names with numerical suffixes in the `_print_Symbol` method, which is correct. However, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `split_super_sub` and `translate` functions, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the `_print_Symbol` method, but it specifically involves restructuring the creation of MathML elements and setting the 'bold' attribute at a different point in the code, not altering the `split_super_sub` or `translate` functions.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable steps that align with the git diff. It suggests reviewing functions and adding a unit test, but it does not guide the developer to the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the restructuring of the MathML element creation. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it correctly identifies the file and method where the issue occurs, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant code. However, the RESPONSE does not guide the developer to the specific changes needed, as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
