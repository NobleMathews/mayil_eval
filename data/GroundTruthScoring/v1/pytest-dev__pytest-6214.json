    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It offers generic advice on verifying fixture usage and placement of print statements, which is not directly related to the issue at hand. The git diff shows a specific change in the pytest_fixture_setup function, where a cache key is generated and used in the cached_result tuple. The RESPONSE fails to address this change or provide a similar solution. The mention of checking code snippets and potential bug reporting is somewhat relevant but does not offer a direct solution to the issue. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach to the issue and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
