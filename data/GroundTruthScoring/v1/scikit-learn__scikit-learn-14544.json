    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE discusses the behavior of the `ColumnTransformer` in relation to the issue, providing a general opinion on how it should handle input requirements and the `n_features_in_` attribute. However, it lacks actionable content and does not provide specific guidance or code changes that would help resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which includes specific code changes such as adding import statements, implementing a new `_validate_features` method, and modifying the `fit_transform` and `transform` methods to handle feature names and counts. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these changes or the introduction of warnings and errors that are present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the discussion of the issue but does not offer actionable advice or closely match the git diff.",
