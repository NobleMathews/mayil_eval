    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the 'do_not_call_in_templates' attribute to the 'YearInSchool' enumeration class, which aligns with the git diff's addition of 'do_not_call_in_templates = True' to the ChoicesMeta metaclass. This change would prevent Django templates from calling the enumeration types as if they were methods, which is the core issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises ensuring that 'YearInSchool' inherits from 'TextChoices', which is a reasonable suggestion since 'TextChoices' uses the 'ChoicesMeta' metaclass. However, this part of the RESPONSE is not directly related to the git diff, which does not make any changes to inheritance.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE recommends updating the template to compare the string representation of 'student.year_in_school' with the string representation of 'YearInSchool.FRESHMAN'. This is a practical workaround for the issue but does not directly address the problem in the same way as the git diff, which aims to make the enumeration types directly usable in templates without needing to compare string representations.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable solution that would resolve the issue, although it includes additional suggestions not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
