    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. It suggests ensuring all estimators raise a `NotFittedError` with a consistent error message when `get_feature_names_out` is called before `fit`, which is exactly what the git diff implements. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `get_feature_names_out` method to include a fitted check, as seen in the git diff. Additionally, it advises updating the test suite to check for message consistency, which is relevant to the issue but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific changes to the `_n_features_out` attribute in `sklearn/random_projection.py`, which is part of the git diff, hence the score of 9 instead of 10.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff by suggesting the addition of a fitted check in the `get_feature_names_out` method, which is implemented in the git diff with the addition of `check_is_fitted(self)`. It also correctly advises raising a `NotFittedError` with a consistent message, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the test suite is relevant and valuable, even though it is not part of the git diff. The only missing element is the specific change to the `_n_features_out` attribute in `sklearn/random_projection.py`, which is why the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score.",
