    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method called `assert_warnings` to the `RunResult` class, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the solution was to add a `warnings` parameter to the existing `assert_outcomes` method in two different files, rather than creating a new method. The RESPONSE does not address the specific enhancement of the `assert_outcomes` method, which is the core of the issue. However, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it does suggest a way to check for warnings, which is related to the issue's intent of enhancing warning assertion capabilities. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not entirely unhelpful but does not align closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
