    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `ASGIRequest` class uses the `get_script_prefix` function to obtain the script prefix, which aligns with the git diff's approach of defining and using the `get_script_prefix` function. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the request handling to prepend the script prefix to the path, which is in line with the git diff's changes to the `script_name` assignment in the `ASGIRequest` class.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests modifying or implementing a `get_full_path` method, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff does not modify any `get_full_path` method but instead refactors the `get_script_prefix` logic into a separate function and updates references to use this new function. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests importing `get_script_prefix` from `django.urls.base`, while the git diff defines this function within the `asgi.py` file itself.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and includes code snippets to check, which are helpful for understanding the context of the issue. However, it does not perfectly align with the git diff's approach, as it introduces changes that are not reflected in the git diff, such as the `get_full_path` method and the incorrect module import. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not directly align with every aspect of the git diff.",
