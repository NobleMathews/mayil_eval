{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `CheckboxInput.get_context` method to prevent the `attrs` dictionary from being modified in place. This aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, which also modifies the `get_context` method to ensure that the `attrs` dictionary is not incorrectly updated across multiple checkbox widgets.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to use a copy of the `attrs` dictionary before modifying it is effectively the same as the git diff's solution, which uses a dictionary unpacking technique to merge a new 'checked' key into a copy of `attrs` if necessary.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to relevant code snippets in the Django repository, which could be helpful for a developer looking to understand the broader context of the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not use the exact same code as the git diff, which uses a more concise one-liner to achieve the same result. This difference does not detract from the effectiveness of the RESPONSE's solution but does mean it is not a perfect match to the git diff, hence the score of 8.",
