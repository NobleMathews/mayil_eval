    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and suggests a comprehensive approach to fixing the problem with the `deconstruct` method in the `Q` class. It correctly identifies the need to handle single-child `Q` objects and the serialization of complex objects like `Exists`. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the proposed patch, which is a good practice and aligns with the git diff that references the same patch. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed, such as the specific alterations to the `deconstruct` method shown in the git diff. Instead, it offers a more general strategy without the precise implementation details. This is why the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10, but it is still highly relevant and would guide the developer in the right direction to resolve the issue.",
