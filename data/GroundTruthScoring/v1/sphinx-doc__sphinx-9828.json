    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new configuration parameter `use_fuzzy_translations` and modifying the `sphinx/sphinx/util/i18n.py` file to pass this parameter to the `write_mo` function. However, it incorrectly advises adding the parameter directly to the `conf.py` file and importing it in `i18n.py`, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the parameter should be added to `sphinx/config.py` with a default value and then accessed via the `config` object in the application. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the correct function signature change for `write_mo` and does not mention the necessary changes in other files as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of supporting fuzzy translations but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
