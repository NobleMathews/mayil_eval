    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'get_members' function and its usage to ensure that imported members are not included when 'autosummary_imported_members' is set to False. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution involves creating a new 'ModuleScanner' class that handles the scanning of members and the determination of whether they are imported or not. The RESPONSE does not mention creating a new class or the logic encapsulated within the 'ModuleScanner' class. Instead, it focuses on modifying existing code that is not directly related to the solution shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of filtering imported members, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
