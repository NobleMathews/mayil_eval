    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It suggests using the `packaging.version.Version` class for proper semantic version comparison, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the lexicographic comparison is the root cause of the issue and needs to be replaced with a semantic version comparison.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests removing the `try-except` block that handles `InvalidVersion`, which is not in line with the git diff. The git diff retains this block and adds additional logic to handle cases where the version comparison might raise an `InvalidVersion` exception. This is an important part of the solution to ensure robustness when dealing with potentially invalid version strings.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `fulfilled` variable, which is used in the git diff to streamline the logic for determining if the version requirement is met. While this omission does not fundamentally change the solution's effectiveness, it does represent a slight deviation from the git diff's approach.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a solution that would effectively resolve the issue and is largely in line with the git diff, but it is not a perfect match due to the suggested removal of the `try-except` block and the omission of the `fulfilled` variable logic.",
