{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the PostgreSQL backend operations in Django to include the RESTART IDENTITY clause when reset_sequences is True. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests using the TRUNCATE command instead of DELETE when reset_sequences is True, which is in line with the git diff. The provided code snippet demonstrates the changes accurately and is relevant to the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff by suggesting the use of the TRUNCATE command with the RESTART IDENTITY clause to reset sequences in the sql_flush() method for the PostgreSQL backend. The RESPONSE also correctly addresses the performance issue by reducing the number of queries executed when flushing the database. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it provides a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the changes to other database backends as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively.",
