    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking and potentially implementing the `add` filter in `django/template/defaultfilters.py`, which is not directly related to the issue described. The issue is with concatenating a string with a lazy string, not with the existence of the `add` filter itself. The RESPONSE does suggest using `force_str` to handle lazy strings, which is a relevant approach to the problem of type conversion, but it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding `__add__` and `__radd__` methods to the `Promise` class in `django/utils/functional.py`, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, but it does offer a somewhat relevant approach to handling lazy strings, hence the score of 2.",
