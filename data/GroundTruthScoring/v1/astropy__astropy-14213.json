    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `range` argument not accepting instances of `astropy.units.Quantity` in `numpy.histogram`-like functions. It suggests modifying the `histogram2d` function to handle the `range` argument when it is an instance of `astropy.units.Quantity`, which is in line with the git diff that introduces a `_check_range` function to handle the conversion of `range` values to the appropriate units. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the `range` should be converted to the correct unit that matches the units of the input data before passing them to the underlying `numpy` function, which is what the git diff does.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact implementation details as the git diff, such as the specific code changes in the `histogram`, `histogram_bin_edges`, and `histogramdd` functions. Instead, it focuses on the `histogram2d` function and provides a general approach to solving the issue. While the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, it offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to ensure that the `range` argument can be properly handled when it is an instance of `astropy.units.Quantity`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
