{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file and setting the primary key of the instance to `None` after deletion, which aligns with the intent of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly references lines 414 to 457, which do not correspond to the correct location in the git diff. The git diff shows that the change should be made at line 280, not within the lines mentioned by the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not entirely accurate; it suggests using `transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error(self.using)` instead of the correct `transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error()` as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the issue at hand. While the RESPONSE does address the core issue of setting the PK to `None`, it does so with inaccuracies and irrelevant details, leading to a score of 2.",
