    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the use of `models.F` with `asc` and `nulls_last` from the `ordering` option in the `Meta` class of the `Musician` model and instead using a custom manager method or a simple field name string. While this could be a workaround, it does not address the underlying issue in the Django framework that the git diff aims to fix. The git diff provides a solution by adding a `prefix_references` method to handle the prefixing of references in `OrderBy` objects within related model ordering. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue and instead suggests a change in how the user should define their model, which is not the focus of the issue. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about the nature of the problem and a potential workaround, but it does not offer a solution to the actual bug in the Django framework, which is why it receives a low score.",
