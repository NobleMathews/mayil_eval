    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` decorators and ensuring that test functions are instance methods, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the code has been modified to handle both static and class methods correctly by checking for their instances and unwrapping them. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of pytest not discovering certain test methods and instead suggests a workaround that would change the nature of the tests, which is not a solution to the problem described in the ISSUE. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not provide actionable guidance to resolve the issue.",
