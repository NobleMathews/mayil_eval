    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a detailed explanation of how to implement support for unpenalized logistic regression in the `sklearn.linear_model._logistic` module, which is the exact issue described. It suggests adding the 'none' penalty option, modifying the `_check_solver` function, updating the documentation, and adding tests, all of which are in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and a high-level overview of the changes, which are relevant and actionable. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it suggests setting `self.C = np.inf` in the `LogisticRegression` class, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the git diff handles the 'none' penalty in a different but functionally equivalent way by setting `C_ = np.inf` and `penalty = 'l2'` within the `fit` method. The RESPONSE's alternative approach is valid and would achieve the same result as the git diff, so it should not be penalized heavily.",
