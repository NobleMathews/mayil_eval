    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a potential solution to the issue of incorrect indent formatting when using the literalinclude directive with `prepend` or `append`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff suggests a change in the order of filters applied to the lines of code, specifically moving the `dedent_filter` before the `prepend_filter` and after the `lines_filter`. This change is likely meant to address the issue by ensuring that dedentation happens before prepending text, thus preserving the intended indentation.\n\nThe RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying the `dedent_lines` function to handle dedentation differently and to modify the `run` method to handle `prepend` and `append` separately from the dedented content. While this could be a valid approach to solving the issue, it is not supported by the git diff and involves more extensive changes to the codebase.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It offers a different solution that does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
