    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `SQLDeleteCompiler` class to avoid using a subquery when calling `delete()` on a queryset. This aligns with the git diff's intent to address the performance regression and compatibility issue with MySQL's `LOCK TABLES` feature. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `SQLDeleteCompiler` class in `django/db/backends/mysql/compiler.py`, which is not the file targeted by the git diff. The git diff modifies `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` instead. Additionally, the RESPONSE's proposed code change introduces a new method implementation for `as_sql`, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff simply adds a call to `self.query.get_initial_alias()` within the `single_alias` method to ensure the base table is in aliases, which is a more concise and targeted fix. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the SQL generation issue, it does not closely match the git diff's approach and is incomplete in terms of the specific changes needed according to the git diff.",
