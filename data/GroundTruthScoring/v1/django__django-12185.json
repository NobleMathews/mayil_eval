    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue described. The RESPONSE suggests checking database support for window functions, reverting changes, and verifying the use of the `Window` function according to documentation. However, it does not offer a concrete solution to the problem of `NotSupportedError` being raised when window expressions are used in a `SELECT` clause, which is the core issue. The git diff shows specific changes to the Django ORM codebase that address the issue by modifying the `check_filterable` method and related function calls to allow window expressions in the `SELECT` clause without raising an error. The RESPONSE fails to mention or suggest any changes to the codebase, let alone the specific changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and does not align with the git diff. The score is not 0 because the RESPONSE does correctly identify that the issue is related to the use of window expressions in a `SELECT` clause, but it fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance to resolve the issue.",
