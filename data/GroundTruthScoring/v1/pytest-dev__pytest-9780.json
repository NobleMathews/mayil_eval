    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the placement and syntax of the `pytest.ini` file, checking for changes in pytest 7.1.0 related to `conftest.py` discovery or custom marks registration, and reviewing the pytest changelog for version 7.1.0. While these are general troubleshooting steps that could be relevant to the issue, they do not align with the specific change made in the git diff, which modifies the `_is_in_confcutdir` method to use a different approach for determining if a path is within the `confcutdir`. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change or the logic behind it, which is to fix the issue with `conftest.py` not being picked up by using a different method to check the path. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of `conftest.py` discovery, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
