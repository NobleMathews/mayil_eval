    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to identify and fix the issue with session data decoding during the transition to Django 3.1. However, it does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a check for the 'sha1' hashing algorithm and using a legacy encoding method if it is set. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests checking various parts of the codebase and updating methods to handle different hashing algorithms, but it does not mention the addition of a legacy encoding method or the specific check for 'sha1' as seen in the git diff. The RESPONSE does mention ensuring that encode() and decode() methods can handle 'sha1' hashed data, which is somewhat relevant, but it lacks the specificity and direct action shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
