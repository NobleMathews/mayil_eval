    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature request for more custom docstring section styles in the Napoleon Sphinx extension, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the `napoleon_custom_sections` configuration and updating the `NumpyDocstring` and `GoogleDocstring` classes to handle the new style option, which aligns with the git diff's approach to adding support for custom sections that display like the parameters or returns section.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or mention the new methods `_parse_custom_params_style_section` and `_parse_custom_returns_style_section` that are introduced in the git diff. It also does not reflect the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the detailed implementation within the `_load_custom_sections` method. Instead, it provides a pseudo-code example that does not match the git diff's changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need to update the configuration and parsing logic, but it lacks the specificity and completeness of the git diff. Therefore, it is scored as a 4, indicating that it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
