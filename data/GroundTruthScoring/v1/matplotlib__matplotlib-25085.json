    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 1 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a `get_renderer` method to the `FigureCanvasPdf` class and modifying the `Widget` class to handle the absence of blitting support. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `FigureCanvasPdf` class or the addition of a `get_renderer` method. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to the `Widget` class and its subclasses to include a check for a changed canvas using a new `_changed_canvas` method. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the issue by checking for a canvas change within the widget's event handling methods. The RESPONSE's suggestion to handle the absence of blitting support is somewhat relevant to the issue of blitting being broken when saving as PDF, but it does not provide actionable changes that match the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
