    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the problem and suggests areas of the code to review, but it does not offer specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the `diophantine` function is not finding all solutions for certain quadratic Diophantine equations, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, it does not provide any concrete code changes or specific fixes that would resolve the problem. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these links are not actionable since they are not part of the git diff and do not directly contribute to solving the ISSUE. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff, which includes specific code changes to the `_diop_quadratic` and `cornacchia` functions, as well as an adjustment in the `diop_DN` function to handle a special case when `D == -1`. The RESPONSE fails to mention these specific functions or the nature of the changes required, which are clearly outlined in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
