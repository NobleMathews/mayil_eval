    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue with the CsrfViewMiddleware.process_response() method and offers actionable steps that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to prevent self._set_token from being called twice and to ensure that csrf_cookie_needs_reset leads to a call to self._set_token if necessary. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the process_response method to unset csrf_cookie_needs_reset after the CSRF cookie is set, which is in line with the git diff's approach to setting response.csrf_cookie_set to True and request.csrf_cookie_needs_reset to False after the cookie is sent.\n\nThe RESPONSE further advises checking for other middleware or decorators that might affect the csrf_cookie_needs_reset flag, which is a valid consideration even though it is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's exact changes but provides a comprehensive and effective alternative approach to resolving the issue.\n\nThe only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the RESPONSE does not explicitly mention the renewal of the expiry timer for the CSRF cookie, which is a detail included in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
