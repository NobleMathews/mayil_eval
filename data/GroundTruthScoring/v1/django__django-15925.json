    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is relevant to the issue described, which is the failure of migrations when attempting to remove indexed fields in SQLite 3.35.5+. The RESPONSE suggests a manual approach to remove the index associated with the field before using the `RemoveField` operation, which is a viable workaround for the problem described in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, which modifies the `remove_field` method in the Django backend for SQLite to handle indexed fields properly. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to manually drop the index before the `RemoveField` operation could achieve a similar result, preventing the migration error.\n\nThe RESPONSE is actionable and provides a clear sequence of steps to resolve the issue, including the use of raw SQL to drop the index. This approach is a valid alternative to the change made in the git diff and could be effective in the context of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly address the change in the git diff, which is an update to the Django codebase itself. Instead, it offers a workaround that developers can implement in their migration files. While this does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the Django framework, it is still a relevant and effective solution for developers facing the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE could be improved by acknowledging the change in the git diff and suggesting that the developers update to the latest version of Django where this fix is implemented. However, the workaround provided is still a valuable alternative for those who may not be able to update immediately or are using a version of Django where the fix is not available.",
