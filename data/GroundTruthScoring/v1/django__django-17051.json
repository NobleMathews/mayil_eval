    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature of returning IDs in `QuerySet.bulk_create()` when `update_conflicts` is True. It suggests modifying the `bulk_create` method to accept a new parameter for returning IDs and updating the `_batched_insert` method to handle this parameter and include the `RETURNING` clause if `update_conflicts` is True.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the condition within the `_batched_insert` method to check for `on_conflict` being `None` or equal to `OnConflict.UPDATE`. It then adds the `on_conflict`, `update_fields`, and `unique_fields` parameters to the `_insert` method call within `_batched_insert`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests adding a new parameter `return_ids` to both `bulk_create` and `_batched_insert`, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and explanations that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of returning IDs when `update_conflicts` is True, but it does not provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE's approach is different and would not lead to the same result as the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
