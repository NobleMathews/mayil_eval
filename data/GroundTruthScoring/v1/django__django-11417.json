    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to update the mail backend to use the modern standard library parsing approach, which is the issue at hand. It correctly suggests replacing the usage of `email.utils.parseaddr` with `email.headerregistry.parser.get_mailbox()` in the `sanitize_address` function, which is aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a revised version of the `sanitize_address` function that closely matches the changes in the git diff, including the handling of exceptions and the correct parsing of the email address components.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the code snippet provided, as it includes a check for the '@' character in the address when it's a tuple, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as it still achieves the same result and is a valid alternative approach. The RESPONSE also correctly advises testing the updated function and checking for other parts of the code that may need updating, which is good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that would enable a developer to fix the issue effectively. It closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue and offers a valid, effective alternative where it differs slightly.",
