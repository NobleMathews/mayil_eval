{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a broad review of the handling of boolean values in various parts of the codebase, including the `Boolean` class `_setup` method, the `Fill` class `get_mapping` method, and the `forward` function. However, it does not provide a specific solution or directly address the TypeError caused by the subtraction of boolean values, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the specific change needed to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows a specific change where the `vmin` and `vmax` values are converted to floats after being processed by `axis.convert_units`. The RESPONSE fails to suggest this or a similar concrete solution, thus it is not highly relevant or actionable. However, it does recognize the nature of the problem with boolean subtraction and suggests ensuring that boolean values are handled correctly, which is somewhat related to the issue, hence the score of 2.",
