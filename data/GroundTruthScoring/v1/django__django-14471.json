{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue description, and whether it provides clear, actionable, and relevant instructions to assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying `CsrfViewMiddleware.process_request` to raise `InvalidTokenFormat` and updating `CsrfViewMiddleware.process_view` to handle this exception by rejecting the request, which aligns with the git diff's approach of handling the `InvalidTokenFormat` exception in both methods. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to remove logic that generates a new CSRF token when an invalid CSRF cookie is encountered, as the git diff shows that the new token generation is now handled within the exception block. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that `InvalidTokenFormat` includes a meaningful `reason` attribute, which is consistent with the git diff's use of the exception's reason string in the rejection message.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to the comments in the `_get_token` method, nor does it explicitly state that the `csrf_cookie_needs_reset` flag should be set when the exception is caught in `process_request`, which are both present in the git diff. While these omissions do not significantly detract from the RESPONSE's utility, they prevent it from being a perfect match to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff, but with minor details missing.",
