    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable guidance or meaningful information that would assist the developer in resolving the issue. It does not address the specific problem of strange behavior with cse() for MatrixSymbol indexing as described in the issue. Instead, the RESPONSE states that there is a lack of understanding of the problem and requests more information, which is not helpful for the developer looking for a solution. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows specific changes to the `cse_main.py` file to handle instances of `MatrixSymbol` and `MatrixElement` correctly within the `tree_cse` function. The RESPONSE does not offer any alternative solutions or insights into the problem, and therefore, it does not provide any value in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
