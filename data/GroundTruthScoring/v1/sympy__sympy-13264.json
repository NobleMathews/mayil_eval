{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new parameter `recursive` to the `simplify` function and implementing a recursive call to `simplify` if certain conditions are met. This approach is somewhat aligned with the issue, which describes a problem with the `simplify` function not performing the ultimate simplification step and suggests a recursive mode as a potential solution.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `simplify` function, including the addition of a `rational` parameter, handling of floats, and additional simplification steps, none of which are mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE focuses on a recursive approach with a `max_rec_steps` parameter, which is not present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It offers a different solution that does not reflect the changes made in the git diff, such as the handling of floats and the additional simplification steps. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
