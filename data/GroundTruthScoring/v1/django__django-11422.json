    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general troubleshooting steps for ensuring that `manage.py` is being watched by the autoreloader, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff specifically addresses the problem by modifying the `iter_modules_and_files` function in `django/utils/autoreload.py` to handle the case where `__main__` (usually `manage.py`) does not have a `__spec__` set. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific solution or any changes to the `iter_modules_and_files` function. Instead, it suggests verifying and ensuring that `manage.py` is being watched by various methods and classes, which is not directly related to the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue but does not provide specific instructions on what to change within those snippets to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
