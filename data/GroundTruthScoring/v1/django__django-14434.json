    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `_create_unique_sql` function expecting a string argument for the table name instead of a `Table` instance. It also correctly suggests modifying the `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` file to ensure that the `table` parameter is a string when passed to `Columns`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific changes needed. The git diff shows that the `table` variable should be assigned directly from `model._meta.db_table` without wrapping it in `Table`, and the `Table` instance should only be created when passing the `table` argument to the `Statement` constructor. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `Table(table, self.quote_name)` is a string, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to review the usage of `Table` and `Columns` throughout the codebase, which is not reflected in the git diff but could be considered a good practice. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but these are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff.",
