    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but lacks alignment with the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `rebuild_method` function to handle the 307 Temporary Redirect status code correctly by preserving the original HTTP method. While this is a reasonable suggestion and could potentially address the issue of incorrect method selection after a redirect, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves overriding the original request with the prepared request and then using the updated request object for the subsequent `self.send` call. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach at all. Instead, it focuses on adding conditions to the `rebuild_method` function, which is not part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for context but do not directly contribute to solving the issue as per the git diff.",
