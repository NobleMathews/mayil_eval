    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests general troubleshooting steps such as ensuring valid QuerySets, checking field existence, verifying database aliases, and reviewing the stack trace. However, these suggestions do not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to a bug in the Django framework's handling of combined querysets with ordering. The git diff indicates that the issue is resolved by modifying the Django framework's code to check for the presence of 'self.select' when 'self.query.combinator' is true. The RESPONSE fails to identify or suggest modifying the framework's code, which is the key to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does provide a link to the relevant code section, but without actionable advice on what to change, this is of minimal value. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 1, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
