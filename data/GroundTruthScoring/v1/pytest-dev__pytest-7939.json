    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately addresses the issue by suggesting the addition of the shorthand CLI argument `--sw-skip` alongside the existing `--stepwise-skip` option in the `pytest_addoption` function. This matches the git diff, which also adds the `--sw-skip` option with the same destination as `--stepwise-skip`. The RESPONSE provides clear instructions on how to implement the change, which is exactly what is needed to resolve the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE correctly ignores the irrelevant code snippet provided at the end, focusing solely on the issue at hand.",
