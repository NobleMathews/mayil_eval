    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a validation check to ensure that when `class_weight` is set to `balanced_subsample`, the `max_samples` value is not too low to create a non-empty subsample for any class. It also proposes a method to determine a suitable threshold for `max_samples` and to raise a `ValueError` if the value is below the threshold.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does address the issue of preventing an ungraceful failure when `max_samples` is too low, it does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff modifies the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function to ensure that at least one sample is returned when `max_samples` is a float, by using `max(round(n_samples * max_samples), 1)`. This is a more direct and efficient solution than what the RESPONSE suggests, which involves additional validation and computation of a minimum threshold.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets and references to the sklearn repository, which are not directly relevant to the solution and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution that is as simple and effective as the one in the git diff, and it introduces unnecessary complexity.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It offers an alternative approach but one that is less efficient and more complex than the solution provided in the git diff.",
