    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of prefetch_related not working with a GenericForeignKey for a model using a UUID field as PK.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several steps to troubleshoot the issue with prefetch_related and GenericForeignKey, including verifying the setup of ContentType and object_id fields, using custom querysets with Prefetch objects, checking for bugs in Django or third-party libraries, updating Django, and manually fetching related objects as a last resort. However, none of these suggestions align with the git diff provided, which adds a get_prep_value method to the UUIDField class in Django's models/fields/__init__.py file. The git diff indicates that the solution involves ensuring the UUID value is properly prepared before being used in database operations, which is not addressed in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but these do not offer direct solutions or actionable steps that align with the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to identify the core problem related to the preparation of the UUID value, which is addressed in the git diff, and instead offers general troubleshooting steps that do not contribute to resolving the specific issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
