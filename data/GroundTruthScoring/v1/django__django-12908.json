    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several steps to address the issue with the `.distinct()` method not affecting the queryset as expected after a `.union()` operation. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff adds a call to `_not_support_combined_queries('distinct')` within the `distinct` method, which is a direct way to raise an error when `distinct` is called on a queryset that has been combined with another queryset using `union`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, provides general advice on checking compatibility with the database backend, handling of `distinct_fields`, and the use of `order_by` with `distinct`. It also suggests using `.raw()` to create a custom SQL query, which is a valid alternative but not as straightforward as the change in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to raise an error for this specific case, which is the core of the git diff solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, resulting in a low score.",
