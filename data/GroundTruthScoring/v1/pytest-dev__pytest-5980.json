    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance. It suggests removing the `--result-log` option and implementing a new logging mechanism, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows the addition of a `report_log` option and the creation of a new `report_log.py` file to handle the logging, which the RESPONSE does not mention. The RESPONSE also suggests creating a function named `pytest_replay_logfile` for replaying tests from a log file, which is not part of the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE does not address the removal of the experimental warning from the `pytest_report_to_serializable` and `pytest_report_from_serializable` hooks, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses logging, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
