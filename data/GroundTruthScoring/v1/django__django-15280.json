    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general overview of steps that could be taken to investigate the issue, such as ensuring correct usage of `only` and `prefetch_related`, and checking the setup of the `Profile` model's `user` field. However, it does not provide a specific solution or actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `get_prefetch_queryset` method, adding a condition to check if the field is cached before setting the attribute. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or provide an alternative solution that would prevent the additional query from being executed. Instead, it suggests reviewing the `get_prefetch_queryset` method and other related functions without pinpointing the exact issue or offering a concrete solution. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be related to the issue but does not provide actionable insights based on those snippets. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
