    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is the incorrect behavior of the `biweight_location` function when dealing with a constant array. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the function to handle the case where the MAD is zero by returning the median instead of performing the division, which aligns with the git diff's approach of handling zero MAD values. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the conditional check for `mad == 0.0` to return the median `M` directly. However, the RESPONSE does not include the additional handling for the `axis` parameter as seen in the git diff, where the code checks for constant arrays along a specified axis and prevents division by zero by setting `mad` to 1. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `np.where` to handle the case when `mad` is zero for any axis, which is not present in the git diff. While this is a valid alternative approach, it is not exactly what the git diff implements. The RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful but not necessary for the fix. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a solution that would likely resolve the issue, but it does not perfectly match the git diff in its entirety.",
