    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the function call from `call_command('test', flag=True)` to `call_command('test', '--flag')`, which is a valid suggestion for using boolean flags in command-line interfaces. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the `get_actions` function in the Django management command initialization code to handle boolean arguments correctly when called programmatically. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the Django code that causes the error when using `call_command` with boolean flags. Instead, it suggests a workaround that avoids the issue altogether. While the workaround may be useful, it does not contribute to fixing the actual bug in the codebase. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not address the specific issue described.",
