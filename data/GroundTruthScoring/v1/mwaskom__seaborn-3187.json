    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the legend handling code to use the formatter's `get_offset` method to apply the offset to the legend labels and to check and update `mpl.rcParams` settings. While this approach could potentially address the issue of incorrect legend values for large numbers, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution implemented was to disable the use of offset and scientific notation by setting `set_useOffset(False)` and `set_scientific(False)` on the formatter, rather than adjusting the legend labels with the offset value.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention disabling the offset and scientific notation, which is the core of the solution in the git diff. Instead, it suggests an alternative approach that involves adjusting the legend labels with the offset value, which is not supported by the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and references to specific lines in the seaborn repository that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it does offer a potential solution to the problem of incorrect legend values, but it does not align with the git diff's approach and does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use the `get_offset` method and update `mpl.rcParams` settings is not supported by the git diff, and therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
