    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `__getitem__` and `__iter__` methods from the `LazyObject` class, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff does not indicate any removal of methods but instead adds a `__getattribute__` method to handle attribute access and a `_mask_wrapped` attribute to control the masking of wrapped object methods. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific traceback adjustment and the addition of the `_mask_wrapped` attribute, which are key elements in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that is aligned with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
