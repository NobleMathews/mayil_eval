    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies the issue as an AttributeError caused by attempting to access the 'free_symbols' attribute on an integer object. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the code to handle integer solutions separately and only access 'free_symbols' on sympy expressions, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the problem.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue and provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It suggests checking if 'solns' contains integers and handling them separately, which is similar to the git diff's addition of a check for non-parametric solutions and the creation of a FiniteSet for integer solutions. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the 'free_symbols' attribute should only be accessed on sympy expressions, not plain Python integers, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of handling parametric solutions with free symbols differently.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the changes made to the 'diophantine' function in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's suggested changes to the 'intersection.py' file are closely aligned with the git diff's changes to the same file. The RESPONSE's solution is effective and relevant, and it would likely resolve the issue if implemented.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the 'permute=True' parameter to the 'diophantine' function call or the handling of TypeError and NotImplementedError exceptions, which are present in the git diff. However, these omissions do not significantly detract from the overall relevance and effectiveness of the RESPONSE's solution.",
