    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `as_compatible_data` function to include a check for `dtype==object` and return the input value directly in such cases. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it addresses the problem of type coercion when assigning values to a `DataArray`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which specifically adds a condition to check if the data is an instance of `pd.Series`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.DataFrame` before accessing the `.values` attribute. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check for `dtype==object` is not present in the git diff, and it does not provide the same level of specificity as the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE lacks actionable content that directly matches the git diff's approach, such as the specific condition to check for pandas data structures. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer a close match to the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
