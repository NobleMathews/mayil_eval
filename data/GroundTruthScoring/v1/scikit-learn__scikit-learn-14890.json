    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is highly relevant to the issue. It suggests ensuring that `TransformedTargetRegressor` and other estimators within the `Pipeline` can handle the `sample_weight` parameter, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that `sample_weight` should be passed as a keyword argument inside a dictionary to the `fit_params` argument of the `Pipeline`. This aligns with the git diff's approach of changing the `fit` method signature to accept `**fit_params` instead of `sample_weight=None`. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not suggest modifying the `fit` method of `TransformedTargetRegressor` directly, but it achieves a similar result by changing how `sample_weight` is passed to the `fit` method. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the relevant code snippets, which could help the developer understand where the changes need to be made. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change as shown in the git diff, which would have been a direct instruction to modify the `fit` method. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach.",
