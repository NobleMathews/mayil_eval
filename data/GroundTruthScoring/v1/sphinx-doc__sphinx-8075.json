    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `visit_figure` and `depart_figure` methods in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` to handle figures without captions when `numfig` is enabled. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to `sphinx/writers/latex.py`. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to `sphinx/domains/std.py`, `sphinx/events.py`, and `sphinx/transforms/post_transforms/__init__.py` to address the issue of undefined labels and improve the warning messages for missing references. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader topic of handling figures without captions in Sphinx, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff or the specific issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 1.",
