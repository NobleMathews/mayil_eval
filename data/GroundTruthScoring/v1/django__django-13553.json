    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file to handle the `ORDER BY` clause in the context of a `union()` operation. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual change was made in the `django/db/models/query.py` file, specifically in the `union()` method itself. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the case where only one non-empty queryset is passed to `union()`. Instead, it proposes a more complex solution involving checking database capabilities and modifying SQL generation, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of `ORDER BY` clauses in `union()` queries, but it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's simpler and more direct solution. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
