    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new command-line argument to specify the output file for the parseable format and modifying the existing output handling to support writing to both stdout and the specified output file. While this approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align closely with the git diff provided.\n\nThe git diff shows a more complex implementation that involves creating a new `_load_reporter_by_class` function, modifying the `_load_reporters` method to handle multiple reporters, and adding a new `MultiReporter` class in a separate file. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes and instead focuses on a simpler approach that does not reflect the actual changes made in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice, such as updating the command-line argument parsing and extending the `BaseReporter` class, but it fails to capture the essence of the git diff's approach to handling multiple output formats and reporters. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks the necessary details to fully address the issue as solved by the git diff.",
