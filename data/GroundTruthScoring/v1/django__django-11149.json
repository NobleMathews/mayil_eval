    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `has_change_permission` method and the `get_formset` method in `InlineModelAdmin` to handle view-only permissions. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of permissions in the Django admin, it does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff introduces a new method `_has_any_perms_for_target_model` to centralize the permission checks for auto-created ManyToManyField's implicit through models and modifies the `has_add_permission`, `has_change_permission`, `has_delete_permission`, and `has_view_permission` methods to use this new centralized method. The RESPONSE, however, suggests a different approach by directly modifying the `has_change_permission` and `get_formset` methods without introducing a new centralized method. This approach is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff's strategy of centralizing the permission checks. Additionally, the RESPONSE's code snippet is not entirely accurate, as it suggests disabling form fields, which is not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear, actionable solution that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
