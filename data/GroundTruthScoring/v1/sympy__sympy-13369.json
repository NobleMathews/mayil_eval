    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue. The git diff suggests changes to the `_try_heuristics` function in the `polyroots.py` file, while the RESPONSE incorrectly focuses on modifying the `_eigenvals()` function in `eigen.py` and provides general advice that is not actionable or specific to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant suggestions such as handling triangular matrices and using numerical methods as a fallback, which are not related to the issue described or the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not relevant to the actual fix required, as indicated by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any meaningful assistance to the developer in fixing the issue.",
