    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_is_setup_py' function to use UTF-8 encoding when reading the 'setup.py' file, which is a relevant and actionable piece of advice that addresses the issue of UnicodeDecodeError. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of reading the file as binary and then checking for the presence of bytes corresponding to 'setuptools' or 'distutils'. Instead, it suggests specifying the encoding as UTF-8 in the open function, which is a different but potentially valid solution to the problem. The RESPONSE also does not include the changes to the function signature and return type that are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to check other file reading operations in the pytest codebase, which is beyond the scope of the git diff but could be considered good general advice. Overall, the RESPONSE provides a partial solution that could potentially resolve the issue but does not fully match the git diff's approach.",
