    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the incorrect encoding declaration with a valid one and ensuring that the encoding specified is recognized by Python. However, this does not align with the git diff, which modifies the error handling and messaging in the Pylint codebase to provide a more informative error message when an unknown encoding is encountered. The RESPONSE does not address the changes in the git diff, which involve adding a confidence level to the error messages and improving the error message format. Instead, it suggests a manual fix to the source code being linted, which is outside the scope of the issue described. The issue is about improving Pylint's error handling, not about fixing user code. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist the developer in resolving the issue as described.",
