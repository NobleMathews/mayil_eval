    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed approach to handling the issue with the `createsuperuser` command in non-interactive mode when `ManyToManyField` is in `REQUIRED_FIELDS`. It suggests ensuring that `field.clean()` is called with the correct type of value for `ForeignKey` fields and that for `ManyToManyField`, the value passed is a list of primary keys or model instances. This aligns with the git diff, which adds a check to convert a string of comma-separated primary keys into a list for `ManyToManyField`.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to suggest handling `ForeignKey` fields by converting input values to model instances before calling `field.clean()`, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is relevant to the broader issue described. It also recommends updating the `create_superuser` method to handle these fields correctly, which is implied by the git diff's changes but not explicitly stated.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes additional suggestions for handling `ForeignKey` fields and error handling that are not present in the git diff. However, these suggestions are relevant and could be considered a comprehensive approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff for `ManyToManyField`, but it does suggest a similar approach of handling a string of comma-separated primary keys.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, although it includes additional suggestions not present in the diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
