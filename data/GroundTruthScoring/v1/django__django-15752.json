    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns well with the git diff. It correctly suggests adding a deprecation warning to the `make_random_password()` function using the `warnings.warn()` method, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also advises updating the documentation string of the `make_random_password()` function to indicate that it is deprecated, which is a reasonable step in the deprecation process, although it is not explicitly shown in the git diff. Searching the codebase for any usage of `make_random_password()` and replacing it with an alternative if necessary, as well as updating tests and documentation, are all relevant and necessary steps for deprecating a function, but these steps are not part of the git diff provided. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the specific deprecation warning used (`RemovedInDjango51Warning`), but it does not contradict it either. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would help the developer in deprecating the function, even though it includes additional steps not present in the git diff.",
