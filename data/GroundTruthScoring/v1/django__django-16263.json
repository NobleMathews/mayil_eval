    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a general suggestion to modify the `get_count` method to strip annotations not used in filter operations, which is somewhat aligned with the issue description. However, the provided code snippet does not match the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, and the RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_count` method to strip unused annotations, which is related to the issue of optimizing count queries. However, the git diff shows a more complex and comprehensive approach, involving changes to multiple methods and files to address the issue. The RESPONSE's code snippet is overly simplistic and does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `get_refs` method and the adjustments to the `solve_lookup_type` and `build_filter` methods, among others.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for a developer to locate relevant sections of the code. However, these links do not compensate for the lack of alignment with the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE fails to provide specific, actionable guidance that would enable a developer to implement the necessary changes to fix the issue as per the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks the detailed and accurate guidance needed to assist a developer in resolving the issue effectively. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
