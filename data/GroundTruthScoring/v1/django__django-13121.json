    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the handling of `DurationField` arithmetic and the `convert_durationfield_value` function, which is not directly addressed in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the `CombinedExpression` class and the removal of the `date_interval_sql` method from the base and backend-specific operations files, which indicates that the issue is being resolved by refactoring the way duration expressions are handled in the codebase, rather than modifying the `convert_durationfield_value` method or the `DurationField`'s `get_db_prep_value` method as suggested by the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of refactoring the expression classes and removing the `date_interval_sql` method. Instead, it suggests modifying methods that are not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does mention the handling of `DurationField` arithmetic, which is somewhat related to the issue at hand, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the specific changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not entirely unhelpful, but it does not offer a viable alternative or closely match the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
