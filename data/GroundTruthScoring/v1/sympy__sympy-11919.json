    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests renaming the custom `gamma` function to avoid conflict with the built-in `gamma` function, which is a reasonable approach but does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue is resolved by modifying the `_print_gamma` method in the `pretty.py` file to distinguish between the gamma function and other uses of the symbol 'gamma'. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of pretty printing within the SymPy library and instead suggests a workaround that may not be suitable in all cases, especially if the user intends to use the symbol 'gamma' for their custom function. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the conflict between the custom function and the built-in function, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
