    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_combine_single_variable_hypercube` function and the `_check_shape_tile_ids` function to handle missing panels by filling them with a specified `fill_value`. It also suggests adding a new parameter `allow_missing` to the `_check_shape_tile_ids` function to control the behavior regarding missing tiles. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which instead refactors the `_check_shape_tile_ids` function into two separate functions: `_check_dimension_depth_tile_ids` and `_check_shape_tile_ids`, with the former checking the nesting depth and the latter checking the lengths along one dimension. The git diff also modifies the `combine_by_coords` function to conditionally call these functions based on the `fill_value` parameter.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention refactoring the function or the specific changes to the `combine_by_coords` function as shown in the git diff. It also does not provide any code changes or detailed implementation steps that would directly resolve the issue. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses handling missing panels, it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
