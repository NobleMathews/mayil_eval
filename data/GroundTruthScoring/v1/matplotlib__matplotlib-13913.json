    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on handling color specifications in Matplotlib, which is related to the issue at hand. However, it does not address the specific problem described in the issue, which is that `matplotlib.colors.is_color_like` erroneously returns `True` for strings containing integers. The RESPONSE suggests various checks and conversions for the `c` variable but does not provide a direct solution to the bug in the `is_color_like` function or the `_to_rgba_no_colorcycle` function, which is where the git diff indicates the changes need to be made. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for context, but it does not offer actionable steps to fix the issue as the git diff does. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses color handling, but it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff, which is why it receives a low score.",
