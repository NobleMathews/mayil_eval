    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `RenameModel` class to include a check for `db_table` in both `database_forwards` and `database_backwards` methods and to make the operation a noop if `db_table` is set. While this approach is somewhat relevant to the issue of making `RenameModel` a noop when `db_table` is defined, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution implemented involves removing the check for whether the old and new table names are the same and directly altering the table names within the `database_forwards` method. The RESPONSE does not mention altering the table names or the removal of the check, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces a new parameter `db_table` in the `RenameModel` class, which is not present in the git diff and does not seem necessary for the solution. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
