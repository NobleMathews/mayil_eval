    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue by suggesting a review of the pull request, but it does not offer any specific actionable guidance or solutions that align with the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the pull request linked in the issue description, which is a reasonable step in the process of fixing the issue. However, it does not provide any specific guidance on how to modify the code to address the problem of formatting years < 1000 with a leading zero. The git diff provided shows a specific code change that resolves the issue by using string formatting to ensure the year is displayed with two digits, including a leading zero if necessary. The RESPONSE fails to mention or align with this solution, and instead, it focuses on the pull request review process without offering any concrete technical advice. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
