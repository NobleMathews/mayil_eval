    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general approach to troubleshooting the issue with the `--notes` option in pylint, including checking various functions and configurations that might be related to the problem. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by modifying the regex pattern in the `open` method of a checker file to correctly match note tags that are entirely punctuation. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the regex pattern or the `open` method, and instead, it provides a broad set of steps that could be taken to investigate the issue. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader context of the issue, it lacks the specificity and direct relevance to the git diff provided. Therefore, it only partially aligns with the git diff and does not offer a clear, actionable solution.",
