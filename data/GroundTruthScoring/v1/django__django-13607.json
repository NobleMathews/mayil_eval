    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of `BaseFormSet.is_valid()` raising a `ValidationError` when the management form hidden fields are missing. It suggests modifying the `is_valid` method to include a check for the management form's validity before proceeding with validation, which is a relevant and actionable piece of advice. The RESPONSE also includes a detailed explanation of how to update the `management_form` property to handle validation and set errors appropriately.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff provided. The git diff includes changes to the `gettext` import, the addition of a `clean` method to the `ManagementForm` class, the introduction of `default_error_messages` and error handling in the `BaseFormSet` class, and modifications to the `full_clean` method. The RESPONSE does not mention these changes and instead focuses on a different approach by modifying the `is_valid` method and the `management_form` property.\n\nThe RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative to the git diff, as it aims to prevent the `ValidationError` by returning `False` in the `is_valid` method when the management form is not valid. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of `default_error_messages` and the restructuring of error handling in the `full_clean` method.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a viable alternative solution to the issue, but it does not closely match the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a score of 4, as it provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant.",
