    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `PairGrid` class to handle `MultiIndex` columns by flattening them before plotting, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff does not include any changes related to flattening `MultiIndex` columns or modifying the `PairGrid` class. Instead, the git diff simply removes the conversion of `diag_vars` and `diag_axes` to numpy arrays with `np.object_` type, which is not addressed in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, as it suggests a different method to resolve the problem. However, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of handling `MultiIndex` columns in seaborn's pairplot function, which is the core problem described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's solution, but it does offer a potential alternative method to solve the problem, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
