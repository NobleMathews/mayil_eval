    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing `nanpercentile` with `mquantiles` from `scipy.stats.mstats` and ensuring that `nan` values are filtered out before computing the percentiles. However, the git diff does not mention `nanpercentile` or `mquantiles` at all. Instead, the git diff focuses on handling a `TypeError` when calling `np.unique` on a column with mixed data types, including `np.nan` and `str` categories, and does not address the computation of percentiles. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which is to provide a more informative error message when encountering mixed data types in a column. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would help resolve the specific issue described in the git diff. The only slightly relevant part is the mention of handling `nan` values, but the approach suggested is not in line with the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in addressing the issue as described and as fixed in the git diff.",
