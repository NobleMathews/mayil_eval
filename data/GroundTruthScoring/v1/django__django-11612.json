    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the incorrect quoting of a table name in a `CREATE TABLE` statement for SQLite3. It provides actionable advice to locate the code that generates the `CREATE TABLE` statement and ensure that the `db_table` name is correctly quoted, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using the `strip_quotes` function to remove quotes from the `db_table` name.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking the `quote_name` function for consistent and correct usage, which is not directly mentioned in the git diff but is a valid point to consider when dealing with quoting issues in SQL statements.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes made in the PostgreSQL schema file, which are also part of the git diff. While the PostgreSQL changes are not directly related to the SQLite3 issue described, they are part of the overall solution to ensure consistent handling of quoted names across different database backends.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable solution to the SQLite3 issue and aligns closely with the git diff's approach, but it does not address the PostgreSQL part of the diff, which prevents it from scoring higher.",
