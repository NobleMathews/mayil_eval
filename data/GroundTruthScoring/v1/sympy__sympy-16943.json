    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and suggests a solution that involves modifying the `fps` function to ensure it returns a `FormalPowerSeries` object for polynomials. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the `fps` function should not return `None` for polynomials and should instead return the appropriate sequences representing the polynomial in formal power series form. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the `_compute_fps` function to return sequences for polynomials instead of `None`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests adding an `__getitem__` method to the `FormalPowerSeries` class and updating the documentation, which are not part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE proposes changes to the `fps` function itself, while the git diff modifies the `_compute_fps` function and adds a new `Coeff` class. The RESPONSE does not mention the creation of a new `Coeff` class, which is a significant part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of handling polynomials in the `fps` function, but it does not match the git diff's approach of adding a new class and modifying a different part of the code. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers actionable advice that partially matches the git diff.",
