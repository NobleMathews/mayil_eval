    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `decode` method in the `UnsignedIntegerCoder` class to handle the case where the `_Unsigned` attribute is set to `\"false\"` for variables that should be treated as signed byte data. The RESPONSE suggests adding a conditional branch to check if the data type is a byte and `_Unsigned` is `\"false\"`, then convert the data to a signed byte data type, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly addresses the need to cast the `_FillValue` attribute to the signed byte data type if present. The only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it includes additional context and links to code snippets that, while potentially useful, are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. However, these additional details do not detract from the overall quality and relevance of the RESPONSE.",
