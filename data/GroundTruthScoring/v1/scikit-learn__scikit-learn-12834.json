    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests encoding the dependent variable `y` to numeric values before fitting the model, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by changing the data type of the predictions array to match the data type of the classes, rather than encoding the dependent variables. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed, which is to ensure that the predictions array can handle non-numeric data types. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, as the git diff indicates that the change is within the `predict` method of the forest models, not within the utility functions or examples. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it recognizes the issue with non-numeric dependent variables, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
