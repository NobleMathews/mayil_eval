    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `_parameter_constraints` dictionary and the `_validate_params` method in the `BaseDecisionTree` class to ensure that the constraints for `min_samples_split` are correctly defined and that an exception is raised when the value is less than 2. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, as the problem is indeed related to the constraints of `min_samples_split`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves changing the `Interval` type from `Real` to a new identifier `\"real_not_int\"` and updating the `Interval` class to handle this new type, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests modifying the `_validate_params` method to raise `InvalidParameterError`, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE also fails to address the changes made in the `sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py` file, which are key to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks the actionable content needed to closely match the git diff.",
