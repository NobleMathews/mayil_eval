    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a highly relevant solution to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `delete` method in `django/db/models/query.py` to raise a `TypeError` if distinct fields are present, which aligns with the git diff's approach of raising an error when `.distinct()` is used before `.delete()`. Additionally, the RESPONSE offers an alternative solution by proposing the implementation of a custom method to handle the deletion of the first comment for each post, which is a viable and effective alternative to the problematic usage of `order_by`, `distinct`, and `delete` together. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and references to the relevant parts of the Django codebase, which adds value to the developer in locating the areas of the code that need attention. The score is not a perfect 10 because the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions and code for a custom method, which, while useful, are not part of the git diff's solution. However, these suggestions do not detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE, as they provide a practical workaround for the issue.",
