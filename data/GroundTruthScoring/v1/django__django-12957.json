    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `openlayers.js` template to use the `|safe` filter for float values, which is relevant to the issue of ensuring that float values do not break JavaScript syntax due to localization. However, the git diff provided shows a change in the `django/utils/formats.py` file, where a condition is added to return the string representation of the value if `use_l10n` is `False`. The RESPONSE does not address this change in the Python code and instead focuses on a template-level fix. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix suggested in the git diff, which could potentially lead the developer away from the correct solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
