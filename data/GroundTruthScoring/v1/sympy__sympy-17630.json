    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ZeroMatrix` class to include `rows` and `cols` properties and altering the `_blockmul` method of `BlockMatrix` to handle multiplication with `ZeroMatrix` correctly. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of handling `ZeroMatrix` and `Zero` objects, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically adds a condition to handle `MatAdd` class in the `_postprocessor` function, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the exception being thrown during block multiplication involving `Zero` objects, nor does it provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
