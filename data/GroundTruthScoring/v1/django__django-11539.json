    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to move the index name checks from the `Index.__init__` method into the system checks, which is the core of the issue. It correctly identifies the removal of the validation logic from `Index.__init__` and the addition of a new system check method in `django/db/models/base.py`. The RESPONSE also includes the registration of the new system check method within the `Model.check` method, which is in line with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and even includes code snippets that are very similar to the changes shown in the git diff. The only minor discrepancy is that the RESPONSE suggests adding a call to the new `_check_index_names` method within the `Model.check` method, while the git diff shows the checks being added to the `_check_indexes` method. However, this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the overall approach is correct and would lead to the desired outcome.\n\nThe RESPONSE also goes beyond the git diff by suggesting updates to the documentation and the addition of unit tests, which are best practices but not explicitly shown in the git diff. These additional suggestions are valuable and contribute to the overall quality of the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, providing a viable solution to the issue. It only misses a perfect score due to the slight difference in the method where the check is added, but this does not significantly impact the effectiveness of the RESPONSE.",
