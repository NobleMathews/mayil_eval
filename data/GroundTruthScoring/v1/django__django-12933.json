    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `clear_expired` method in two session backends to raise `NotImplementedError` and ensuring that the `clearsessions` management command is catching `NotImplementedError` and raising `CommandError`. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of raising a `CommandError` when a backend does not implement `clear_expired()`, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the change should be made in the `clearsessions` management command file by replacing a write to stderr with raising a `CommandError`. The RESPONSE, however, suggests changes in the session backends, which is not what the git diff indicates. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it does involve raising `CommandError` in the context of `clear_expired`, but it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
