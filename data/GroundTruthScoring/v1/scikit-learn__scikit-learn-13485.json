    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the core issue, which is the inability of `CalibratedClassifierCV` to handle 3D inputs due to the default behavior of `check_array`. The RESPONSE correctly suggests modifying the `CalibratedClassifierCV` code to call `check_array` with `allow_nd=True`, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also provides a pseudo code snippet demonstrating the proposed change, which is similar to the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests modifying the class directly rather than the `fit` method, and it includes additional context about `check_array` that is not present in the git diff. However, these differences do not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as it still offers a viable solution to the issue. The RESPONSE could have scored higher if it had provided an exact match to the git diff, including the specific location of the change within the `fit` method.",
