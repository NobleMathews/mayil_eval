    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a check in the argument parsing code to detect the use of parallel execution with custom plugins and to emit a warning or raise an error if both options are used together. This approach is different from the git diff, which modifies the parallel execution code to re-register dynamic plugins and updates the `load_plugin_modules` function to allow forced reloading of plugins in a multiprocessing context.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Instead of modifying the parallel execution behavior to support custom plugins, the RESPONSE suggests preventing the use of custom plugins with parallel execution altogether. While this could be a valid approach to the problem, it does not match the git diff's solution, which aims to make custom plugins work with parallel execution rather than disallowing it.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of custom plugins not working correctly with parallel execution. However, it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to enabling custom plugins in a parallel context. Therefore, it does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and only partially addresses the issue described.",
