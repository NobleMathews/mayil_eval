    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_solve_reduced_system` function to handle cases where the system is not zero-dimensional, which is aligned with the git diff's intention to raise a `NotImplementedError` for systems that are not zero-dimensional. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance on how to implement this change, nor does it mention the exact condition to check for (i.e., `len(basis) < len(gens)`), which is crucial for the issue at hand.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests adding test cases, which is in line with the git diff, but it does not provide the correct conditions for the test cases as shown in the git diff (e.g., `raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(Poly(x - 1, x, y), (x, y)))`).\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the need to handle non-zero-dimensional systems and to add test cases, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it should receive a score between 1 and 3. Given that it does provide some direction, albeit vague, a score of 2 is appropriate.",
