    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the primary key field in the `Agreement` model is named `id` or updating the `Order` model's `Meta.ordering` to use the correct field name. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not address the core problem of validating related fields and lookups in model Meta.ordering, which is what the git diff aims to solve. The RESPONSE does not provide any guidance on how to implement the validation logic that the git diff introduces. Instead, it focuses on manually correcting the field names, which is only a workaround and not a systematic solution like the one in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly actionable and do not contribute to solving the issue as described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer a solution that aligns with the git diff.",
