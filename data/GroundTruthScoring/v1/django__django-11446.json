    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice for handling 404 errors in a Django application, including setting the DEBUG flag to False, creating or updating a 404.html template, defining a handler404 in urls.py, and ensuring that custom 404 views return an HttpResponseNotFound object. It also suggests checking the code in the django/views/defaults.py file, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the default error pages not being correctly-formed HTML pages, as described in the ISSUE. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the default error handlers to use a new ERROR_PAGE_TEMPLATE constant that contains a full HTML structure. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or provide guidance on creating a constant for the error page template. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides some actionable steps, it does not align closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
