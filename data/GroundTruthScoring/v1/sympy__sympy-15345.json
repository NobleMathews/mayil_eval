    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests adding a mapping for the `Max` function in the `known_functions` dictionary within the `_print_Function` method, which aligns with the git diff that adds the `Max` and `Min` mappings to the `known_functions` dictionary. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure the mapping includes a condition to check the arguments and return the correct Mathematica function syntax, which is consistent with the lambda function used in the git diff for both `Max` and `Min`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `Min` function, which is included in the git diff, but since the issue specifically mentions a problem with the `Max` function, the RESPONSE is still highly relevant and useful for addressing the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also provides a helpful reference to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which would assist the developer in locating where the changes need to be made.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the `_print_MinMaxBase` method, which is added in the git diff to handle the printing of `Min` and `Max` functions. However, since the RESPONSE's suggested changes would still resolve the issue with the `Max` function, it is awarded an 8 for providing a highly relevant and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff.",
