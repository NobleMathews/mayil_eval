    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue by suggesting modifications to the `orient` method in the `ReferenceFrame` class to prevent the clearing of all adjacent relationships and to check for loops in the orientation graph. It also suggests adding a new method `_exists_path_to` to check for the existence of a path between two frames, which is aligned with the git diff's addition of a loop detection mechanism.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the use of warnings to alert the user when a loop is detected, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Instead, it suggests raising a `ValueError`, which is a different approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the specific changes to the documentation that are present in the git diff, such as the addition of the 'Warns' sections in the docstrings of the orientation methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of preventing loops and not clearing relationships indiscriminately. However, it lacks the specific implementation details and the documentation updates that are present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete in its guidance.",
