{
    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a solution that is different from the git diff but achieves the same goal of ensuring that ALLOWED_HOSTS is properly configured. The git diff adds 'ALLOWED_HOSTS' to the tuple_settings in the Django configuration to enforce its type as a list. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests adding a new system check to validate the type of ALLOWED_HOSTS, which is a valid and effective alternative approach to the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a detailed implementation of the system check, including the code for the check function and the error message to be returned if the check fails. It also correctly identifies where in the Django codebase this new check should be added, which is in line with Django's system checks framework.\n\nBy suggesting the addition of a system check, the RESPONSE ensures that the developer is notified of a misconfiguration, which addresses the issue of ALLOWED_HOSTS being initialized with a string. This approach is proactive and aligns with the goal of preventing the bug described in the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a clear, actionable, and relevant solution that effectively addresses the issue and offers a valid alternative to the git diff. Therefore, it deserves a score of 10.",
