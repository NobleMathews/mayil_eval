    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `to_python` method in both `django/forms/fields.py` and `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` to handle the 'nan' string appropriately. It correctly identifies the need to raise a `ValidationError` if 'nan' is passed as a value, which aligns with the git diff's approach to raising `ValidationError` for non-finite decimal values.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff. The git diff removes the import of the `math` module and refactors the `to_python` method to check for non-finite decimal values after conversion, rather than specifically checking for 'nan' or 'inf' strings. The RESPONSE suggests adding a check for 'nan' directly, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes modifications to `django/forms/fields.py`, which is not part of the git diff, and it suggests ensuring that the `create` method of the model manager is not called with 'nan', which is also not addressed in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of handling non-finite values, but it does not closely match the git diff's approach of handling all non-finite values after conversion to a decimal. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 4 for providing some actionable advice that is partially aligned with the git diff.",
