    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the feature request for adding a `negative_linestyle` keyword argument to the `contour` function in Matplotlib, which is in line with the issue description and the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ContourSet` class to accept a `negative_linestyle` keyword argument, updating the `_process_args` method, and adjusting the `_process_linestyles` method to apply the `negative_linestyle` to negative contour levels. This approach is consistent with the git diff, which also introduces a `negative_linestyles` parameter and updates the `_process_linestyles` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to document the new parameter and to add test cases, which is good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation of the default value for `negative_linestyles` using `mpl.rcParams['contour.negative_linestyle']` as seen in the git diff, which is a minor omission.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, with only minor differences in the implementation details. Therefore, it receives a high score for its relevance and utility in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
