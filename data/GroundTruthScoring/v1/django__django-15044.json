    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring thread safety by configuring `pylibmc` for thread safety or using a different caching backend, and potentially using thread synchronization primitives such as locks. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff provided, which solves the thread safety issue by converting the `cache` attribute to a property method, ensuring that each thread gets its own instance of the cache object. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `CacheMiddleware` and `FetchFromCacheMiddleware` classes to use a property for accessing the cache, which is the core of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the thread safety concern, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach. The links to code snippets are not directly helpful in resolving the issue as they do not lead to the actual implementation changes needed. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
