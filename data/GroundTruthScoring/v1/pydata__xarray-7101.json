{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general review strategy for the issue related to updating `_coord_names` and the internal indexes after using `stack` and `assign_coords` methods. It suggests ensuring that the `__len__` method calculates the length correctly and proposes adding a method to explicitly update `_coord_names` and indexes after operations that modify coordinates. The RESPONSE also recommends adding a test case to verify the correct behavior of `__len__` after stacking and assigning coordinates.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of `self._data._coord_names.intersection_update(variables)` in the `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords` method or the change from `DeprecationWarning` to `FutureWarning`. While the RESPONSE's suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not provide the precise actionable guidance seen in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific methods or lines of code that were modified in the git diff, which would have been more helpful for the developer to fix the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 4 as it offers some actionable advice and is partially relevant but does not closely match the git diff or provide a complete solution to the issue.",
