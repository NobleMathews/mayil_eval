    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `lmplot` function to handle the `sharey` parameter correctly and to include an `xlim` parameter. However, the RESPONSE does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the handling of the `sharex`, `sharey`, and `legend_out` parameters by deprecating them and moving them into a new `facet_kws` dictionary, as well as changes to the handling of the `truncate` parameter and the way the data limits are updated. The RESPONSE does not mention the deprecation of parameters or the introduction of `facet_kws`, and it incorrectly suggests adding `xlim` as a parameter to `lmplot`, which is not part of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes to the `truncate` parameter handling or the data limit updates shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
