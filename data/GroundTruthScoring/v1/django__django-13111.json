    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of supporting the \"%V\" format in WeekArchiveView. It suggests updating the `WeekMixin` class to handle the `%V` week format and the `%G` year format, which is in line with the git diff that adds support for `%V` and includes a check for the year format to be `%G`. The RESPONSE also recommends adding error handling to provide a more informative error message when `%V` and `%Y` are used together, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of a `ValueError` for this case.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to the `_get_weekday` method and the `get_dated_items` method that are present in the git diff. While it does suggest modifying the `_get_weekday` method, it does not provide the exact change, which is to include `%V` in the condition that checks for the week starting on Monday. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the update to the `week_choices` dictionary in the `get_dated_items` method, which is a part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that would likely resolve the issue effectively, but it does not include all the specific changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
