{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and offers a series of steps to ensure that the request body is not closed prematurely in the `ASGIHandler` class. It suggests reviewing and modifying the `handle` method to keep the `body_file` open until after the response has been generated, which is in line with the git diff that moves the closing of the `body_file` to after the response has been sent. The RESPONSE also advises checking the `ASGIRequest` class and managing the `_stream` attribute, which is relevant to the issue but not directly addressed in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests looking for `finally` blocks or exception handling that may be closing the `body_file` too early, which is a valid point and aligns with the git diff's approach of restructuring the code to ensure proper timing of the file closure. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but provides a viable alternative approach to the issue, suggesting a broader review and potential restructuring of the code to prevent premature closing of the request body. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, offering clear guidance that would help in resolving the issue, thus warranting a score of 7.",
