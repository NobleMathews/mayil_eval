    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating various functions and adding mechanisms to handle version-specific warning and error codes. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution involves deprecating the 'collect_block_lines' function and refactoring the way block lines and message states are handled in the 'file_state.py' file. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of deprecating a function and refactoring the code to handle message states differently. Instead, it focuses on handling version-specific warning codes, which is not related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would help the developer fix the issue as per the git diff.",
