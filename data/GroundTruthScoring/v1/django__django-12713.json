    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `formfield_for_manytomany` method to handle the `widget` parameter correctly, which aligns with the issue's requirement to allow overriding the widget in `formfield_for_manytomany()`. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of adding a condition to check for the 'widget' key in `kwargs` before the existing logic for setting the widget. Instead, it introduces a new variable `form_field.widget`, which is not present in the git diff and does not match the existing code structure. The RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for context but does not directly contribute to solving the issue. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the need to handle the 'widget' parameter but does not follow the git diff's solution and introduces an element (`form_field.widget`) that is not part of the git diff.",
