    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the Bareiss algorithm's handling of symbolic matrices and suggests modifying the `_det_bareiss` function to handle symbolic matrices correctly. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the `_eval_det_bareiss` function to use a different zero-testing function (`_is_zero_after_expand_mul`) that is more suitable for polynomials and rational functions, thus addressing the issue with symbolic matrices.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `_is_zero_after_expand_mul` function and the use of `_find_reasonable_pivot` with the new iszerofunc. Instead, it provides a general suggestion to modify the `_det_bareiss` function and ensure correct simplification of symbolic expressions.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which could be helpful for a developer, but it does not provide the exact solution or mention the changes to the `random_complex_number` function in `sympy/utilities/randtest.py`, which is also part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is relevant to the issue but does not fully match the git diff or provide a complete solution.",
