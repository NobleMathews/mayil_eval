    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on ensuring that the symbolic expression is properly defined and evaluated before using `lambdify`, and suggests using numerical integration methods like `scipy.integrate.quad` if necessary. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve implementing helper functions to unpack integral limits and updating the `_print_Integral` methods for both `MpmathPrinter` and `SciPyPrinter` classes to handle the integration correctly within `lambdify`. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue of `lambdify` not evaluating integrals correctly. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the topic of integration and `lambdify`, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
