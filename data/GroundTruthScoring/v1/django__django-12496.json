    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general troubleshooting steps for issues related to model inheritance and primary keys in Django. However, it does not address the specific issue described, which is an extra update query being made when a child model inherits from a parent model with a custom primary key. The git diff provided shows a change in the Django framework's code to address the issue, specifically modifying the condition that determines when to force an insert operation. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest modifying the Django framework's code, nor does it provide a solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE does offer some relevant advice, such as ensuring correct configuration of the primary key fields and checking for overridden save methods, but it fails to provide a direct solution to the problem at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
