    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests removing the problematic `F(\"dt\").desc(nulls_last=True)` from the `order_by` call and replacing it with an `OrderBy` expression that includes the `nulls_last` argument. This aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, which involves modifying the `get_order_by` method to handle expressions correctly in the context of a union queryset. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets and references to the relevant parts of the Django codebase, which could be very helpful for the developer to understand the context and the logic behind the changes. However, the RESPONSE does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `F` import and the specific changes within the `get_order_by` method. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a clear alternative solution, it does not match the git diff in its entirety, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
