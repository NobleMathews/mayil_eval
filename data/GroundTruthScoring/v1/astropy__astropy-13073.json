    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative to the issue described. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'convert_numpy' function and the 'Table.read' method, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the '_validate_and_copy' method to handle single converter inputs and improve error messages, as well as updates to the documentation to clarify the use of converters. The RESPONSE fails to mention these specific changes and instead provides a general and incorrect approach to the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
