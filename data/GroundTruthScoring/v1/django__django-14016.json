{
    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests converting the `dict_keys` object to a list before using it in the `Q` object to avoid the `TypeError` when pickling. While this workaround might prevent the immediate error, it does not address the underlying issue in the Django codebase that causes the `TypeError` when using the `|` operator with a `Q` object containing non-pickleable types. The git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `_combine` method in `query_utils.py` to avoid using `copy.deepcopy` and instead reconstruct the `Q` object using its `deconstruct` method. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not provide a solution to the actual code issue. However, it does offer a temporary workaround for users facing the problem, which is why it receives a score of 1 instead of 0.",
