    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the recursive implementation of the `pow_rep_recursive` function with an iterative approach using a stack to avoid the `RecursionError`. While this is a valid general approach to avoid recursion errors, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff provides specific checks and early returns to prevent unnecessary recursive calls and adds a special case handling for when `k == 1`. It also modifies the recursive call to iterate over a range instead of decrementing `n_i` by 1. The RESPONSE does not address these specific improvements and instead offers a high-level alternative solution without considering the optimizations made in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the recursion issue but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
