    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue and suggests areas of the codebase to review, but it does not offer specific, actionable steps to resolve the issue. It correctly identifies that the `ordered` property should reflect the actual SQL query ordering state after using `annotate` and that the issue is related to the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a concrete solution or code changes that would fix the issue, which is what the git diff does by adding a condition to check for `not self.query.group_by` when determining the `ordered` property.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `QuerySet` class and the SQL compiler, as well as ensuring compatibility with PostgreSQL, which are relevant considerations. However, it lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff's approach of modifying the condition within the `ordered` method to account for `GROUP BY` queries. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the solution provided in the git diff and do not offer a clear path to fixing the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, and therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
