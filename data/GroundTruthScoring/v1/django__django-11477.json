    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `translate_url` function in `django/urls/base.py` and updating the `reverse` call to handle optional named groups correctly by providing default values for missing optional arguments. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual change was made in the `match` method of `django/urls/resolvers.py`, where a dictionary comprehension is used to filter out None values from `match.groupdict()` before assigning it to `kwargs`. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or file, and instead focuses on a different function and file altogether.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a general direction for handling optional named groups, which is somewhat relevant to the issue, but it does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE's suggestion to merge `match.kwargs` with a dictionary of default values is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not address the core change made in the git diff, which is to filter out None values directly within the `kwargs` assignment.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but these do not directly contribute to resolving the issue as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and thus receives a score of 2.",
