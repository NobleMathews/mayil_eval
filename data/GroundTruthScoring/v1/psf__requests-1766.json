    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable instructions that directly align with the git diff. It correctly identifies the location of the change within the `requests/auth.py` file and specifies the exact method `build_digest_header` where the modification should be made. The RESPONSE then provides a corrected line of code that includes the necessary double quotes around the `qop-options` values, which is exactly what the git diff shows. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes a step further by suggesting an update to dynamically include the `qop` value from the `self._thread_local.chal` dictionary and ensure it is quoted, which is a valid and effective alternative approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes references to the relevant code snippets, which would assist the developer in locating the code that needs to be changed. Overall, the RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and the issue, providing clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
