    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `ForeignObjectRel.get_choices` method to include the `limit_choices_to` parameter and to ensure that this parameter is handled appropriately within the method. This matches the git diff's approach to adding the `limit_choices_to` parameter and using it in the queryset filtering.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter.field_choices` method to ensure compatibility, which is not directly addressed in the git diff. However, this suggestion is relevant and could prevent potential issues that might arise from the changes made to the `ForeignObjectRel.get_choices` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes references to specific code snippets, which could be very helpful for the developer to locate the relevant sections of code that need to be reviewed or modified. This level of detail adds value to the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it achieves the same result and provides a viable alternative approach to fixing the issue. Therefore, it is scored a 9, as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
