    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating Sphinx to the latest version or creating a custom Sphinx extension to override the default behavior for rendering Enum default values. While updating Sphinx might be a general good practice, it does not directly address the specific issue described, nor does it align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a modification to the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to handle the rendering of Enum values properly, which is a direct fix to the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to create a custom extension could be seen as a workaround, but it does not reflect the changes in the git diff and would require additional effort from the developer to implement. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the problem but offers a potential alternative approach that might be relevant in a broader context. However, it lacks the specificity and direct applicability of the git diff solution.",
