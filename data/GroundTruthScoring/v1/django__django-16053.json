{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `ContentType.__str__` method to use either fully localized or fully non-localized components for consistency, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to address the issue of mixed language output in the string representation of `ContentType` objects. The RESPONSE provides two options, one for using fully localized components and another for using non-localized components, which is a valid approach to solving the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change needed, as shown in the git diff, which specifically replaces `model._meta.app_label` with `model._meta.app_config.verbose_name` to use the localized verbose name of the app. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not match the git diff's approach exactly, hence it does not score a perfect 10. It does, however, provide a viable alternative approach to the issue, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
