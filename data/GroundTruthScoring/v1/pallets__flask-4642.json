    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not directly address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is about the FlaskGroup not working when nested in a click.group. Instead, the RESPONSE provides a general overview of potential steps to troubleshoot Flask CLI integration issues, which are somewhat relevant but not specific to the problem at hand.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `create_app` function is properly defined, the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set, and that `FlaskGroup` is used at the top level of the CLI structure. While these are good general practices, they do not address the core problem of the FlaskGroup not working when nested, which is the focus of the ISSUE.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a solution that involves defining the `FlaskGroup` with the `create_app` function and using `my_big_cli_group` to add commands and nested groups. However, this does not align with the git diff, which makes specific changes to the Flask and Werkzeug codebase to handle the nested FlaskGroup issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results. It also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the solution provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
