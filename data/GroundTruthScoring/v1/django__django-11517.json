    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not directly address the issue described in the ISSUE section or align with the git diff. The suggestions given are generic troubleshooting steps for command argument handling in Django, which might be helpful in a broader context but do not specifically resolve the ValueError or TypeError mentioned in the issue. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the core problem related to the handling of subparsers and required arguments in the `call_command` function. The git diff shows a specific change to the `call_command` function to handle subparser actions correctly, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and does not provide actionable guidance to resolve the specific issue. However, it does mention checking the code related to argument parsing and handling options, which is somewhat relevant, hence the score of 2.",
