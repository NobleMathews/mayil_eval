{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `HttpHeaders` class to include a method that allows accessing header values using keys with underscores instead of hyphens, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a `__getitem__` method to handle the underscore-to-hyphen conversion. Additionally, the RESPONSE proposes creating a context processor to convert all header keys for template usage, which is a viable alternative to directly modifying the `HttpHeaders` class. This alternative approach is relevant and could effectively solve the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not directly modify the `HttpHeaders` class as the git diff does, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. The RESPONSE also provides additional context and links to code snippets that could be useful for the developer, further supporting the relevance and utility of the provided solution.",
