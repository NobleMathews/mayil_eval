    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue, which includes ensuring that the `ProductMetaDataType` model does not have a custom attribute or method named `filterable` set to `False`, and if it is a field, to rename it. This advice is partially aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `check_filterable` method to add a condition that checks for the presence of the `resolve_expression` attribute before evaluating `filterable`. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `check_filterable` method but instead focuses on renaming the field in the model, which is a valid alternative solution. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change needed to fix the issue as shown in the git diff, and it does not address the added condition in the `check_filterable` method. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not fully align with the git diff.",
