    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests general troubleshooting steps for issues with Sphinx documentation, such as checking docstring formatting, configuration settings, and ensuring proper imports. It also advises upgrading Sphinx and reporting the issue if it persists. While these are reasonable suggestions for documentation problems in general, they do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff to address the issue.\n\nThe git diff shows that the code has been modified to handle the case where a class's docstring is an alias, by checking for a variable comment and returning an empty list if one exists, otherwise returning None. The RESPONSE does not mention anything about modifying the code to handle variable comments or checking for alias docstrings, which is the core of the solution in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader context of Sphinx documentation issues, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. Therefore, it does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach to the issue.",
