    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests increasing the maximum recursion depth and optimizing the `is_zero` method, which are general approaches to handling recursion errors but do not directly address the specific issue described. The RESPONSE also suggests checking for infinite recursion patterns and reviewing the implementations of `cosh`, `acos`, and `acosh`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide specific actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the fix involves adding a condition to return `None` when `arg.is_extended_real` evaluates to `True` in the `eval` method of the `complexes.py` file. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific solution or provide an alternative that would achieve the same result. The provided code snippets are relevant to the issue, but the RESPONSE fails to offer actionable guidance based on those snippets that would lead to the resolution of the issue.",
