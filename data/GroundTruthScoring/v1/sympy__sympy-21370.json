    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to resolving the issue with the `_choose_factor` function in `sympy/polys/numberfields.py`, which is indeed the source of the problem according to the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_choose_factor` function to improve the selection criteria for choosing the correct minimal polynomial, which aligns with the changes made in the git diff where the selection process is refined.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable changes that match the git diff, such as the introduction of `subsets` from `sympy.utilities.iterables` and the use of a sorted list of candidate factors to select the minimal polynomial. Instead, it offers a high-level description of what needs to be done without delving into the actual code changes required.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section on code snippets to check, which is not directly relevant to fixing the issue but could be useful for a developer looking to understand the context of the problem. This section does not contribute to the actionable advice for resolving the issue and thus does not increase the score.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is on the right track by identifying the correct function to modify but lacks the specific, actionable details present in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
