    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests moving the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception raise for `SECRET_KEY` from the settings initialization to the point where `Settings.SECRET_KEY` is accessed, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `Settings` class to lazily retrieve the `SECRET_KEY` when it's first accessed rather than at initialization, which aligns with the git diff's approach of checking the value of `SECRET_KEY` in the `__getattr__` method of the `Settings` class. The RESPONSE's suggestion to implement a property for `SECRET_KEY` that raises `ImproperlyConfigured` if the key is not set when accessed is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and achieves the same result. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets and links to the relevant parts of the Django repository, which would be helpful for the developer to check the context and related code. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the changes to the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class or the `check_secret_key` function, which are also part of the git diff, but the main focus of the issue is the handling of `SECRET_KEY`, which the RESPONSE addresses effectively.",
