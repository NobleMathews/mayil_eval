{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of improving error messages for incorrect context processors. It suggests wrapping the code where the context processor is called with a try-except block, catching the TypeError, and raising a more informative error message, which aligns well with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code snippet that illustrates the changes, which is helpful for understanding the proposed solution. However, the RESPONSE suggests using ImproperlyConfigured exception instead of TypeError, which is not exactly what the git diff does. The git diff raises a TypeError with a specific message, while the RESPONSE suggests raising an ImproperlyConfigured exception with a different message. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a check for the updates being a dictionary, which is not present in the git diff. While this check is a good practice, it is not part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not perfectly align with the git diff, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
