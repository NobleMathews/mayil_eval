    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on how to handle migration issues related to unique constraints in Django, which is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE. However, it does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff shows changes in the Django source code to handle the generation of migration operations for unique and index together constraints, while the RESPONSE focuses on manually reviewing and editing migration files, which is not the approach taken in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests checking the order of migrations, explicitly dropping indexes, and renaming constraints to avoid conflicts. These are valid suggestions in general but do not reflect the changes made in the git diff, which involves modifying the Django migration autodetector to correctly handle the generation of migration operations.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution, which involves changes to the internal Django migration system. Therefore, it does not offer significant value towards fixing the issue as described in the git diff. The score reflects the RESPONSE's lack of alignment with the git diff and its failure to provide a viable alternative solution.",
