    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue of CSRF protection for the logout link. It suggests modifying the `LogoutView` to only allow `POST` requests, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a warning for `GET` requests and the intention to remove `GET` as an allowed method in the future. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the logout method in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` to create a `POST` request and to include a CSRF token in the logout form, which is in line with the git diff's emphasis on CSRF protection.\n\nThe RESPONSE further suggests updating the logout URL and ensuring that the `LogoutView` has the `@csrf_protect` decorator, which is consistent with the git diff's deprecation warning and the movement of the `@csrf_protect` decorator from the `post` method to the `dispatch` method in the future.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific deprecation warnings added in the git diff, nor does it include the exact changes to the `http_method_names` and the `get` method in `LogoutView`. While these omissions do not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, they prevent it from being a perfect match to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its high relevance and clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
