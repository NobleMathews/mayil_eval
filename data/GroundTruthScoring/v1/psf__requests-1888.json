    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps that could potentially address the issue described, such as updating libraries and ensuring that the URL is converted to a byte string before being passed to `urllib3` and `pyopenssl`. The suggestion to modify the `resolve_redirects` function in the `requests` library to ensure that the URL is converted to a byte string is aligned with the git diff, which shows a change in the `resolve_redirects` function where the URL is converted using `to_native_string`. However, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest the use of `to_native_string` as seen in the git diff, and it includes additional steps that are not reflected in the git diff, such as updating other libraries and inspecting the `sendall` method implementation in the `pyopenssl` module. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue.",
