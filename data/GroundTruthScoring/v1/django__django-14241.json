{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue with combined querysets in Django, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. It suggests ensuring the correct table alias is used in the ORDER BY clause and modifying the code in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the problem is related to the ordering of combined querysets and the incorrect SQL aliasing for the `id` column.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a specific change in the `get_order_by` method, where it adds a condition to handle the case when `self.query.combinator` is true and `self.select` is not empty. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or the context of `self.query.combinator` and `self.select`. Instead, it provides a more general solution without the precise details shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to review related code sections, but it does not provide the exact solution as the git diff does. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a general direction rather than a specific fix, warranting a score of 4.",
