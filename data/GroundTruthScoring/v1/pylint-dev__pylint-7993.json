    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described, nor does it align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the regular expression used to find arguments in the template, which is the core of the solution to the issue. The RESPONSE, however, does not mention or suggest modifying the regular expression or any specific code change. Instead, it provides a general approach to locate the problem and suggests checking various parts of the code that may not be directly related to the issue. While the RESPONSE does correctly identify that the issue is related to the handling of the `--msg-template` argument, it fails to provide actionable steps that would lead to a resolution similar to what is shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
