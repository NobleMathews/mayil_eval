    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of considering MRO when obtaining marks for classes in pytest.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `BaseMeta` metaclass to aggregate and deduplicate markers from the MRO, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff modifies the `get_unpacked_marks` function to handle the MRO consideration within pytest's own codebase, rather than suggesting changes to user-defined metaclasses or the use of external libraries like `six`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippets and does not provide actionable guidance that would help resolve the issue as described. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `consider_mro` parameter and the adjustments to the `store_mark` function. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
