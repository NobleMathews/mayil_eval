    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE focuses on removing Python 3.6 and PyPy 3.6 from the CI configuration in `.travis.yml`, which is not part of the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the actual changes needed are updates to the version checks in various Python scripts to require Python 3.7 or newer, as well as updating the `python_requires` and classifiers in `setup.py`. The RESPONSE does not address any of these changes and instead provides instructions for a different task that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
