    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the database connection being closed unexpectedly due to the use of `TemporaryFile` in `test_first`, which may be closing the file prematurely. It recommends modifying the `test_first` method to ensure that the file is not closed before the `FileResponse` has finished using it, by manually managing the file's lifecycle and using `self.addCleanup(f.close)` to close the file after the test finishes.\n\nHowever, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the Django core files to change how resources are closed and managed within the `FileResponse` and related classes. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the Django core files to handle resource closing more effectively. Instead, it focuses on a test case modification, which is not the solution provided in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as renaming `_closable_objects` to `_resource_closers`, ensuring that `response.close` is called when using `wsgi.file_wrapper`, and clearing the `_resource_closers` after closing resources. These changes are key to resolving the issue as they ensure proper resource management within the Django framework, rather than just within the context of a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described. It offers a potential workaround for the test case but does not address the underlying issue within the Django framework that the git diff aims to fix. As such, it receives a low score for not providing actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
