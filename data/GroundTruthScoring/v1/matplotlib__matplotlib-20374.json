    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'out_of_date' function to include a new parameter for context dependency and to check the modification time of context files. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, as the issue does involve the 'out_of_date' function not considering included files. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves a more comprehensive change to the 'out_of_date' function to handle a list of included files and does not introduce a context-dependent flag. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests maintaining a 'plot_context' dictionary, which is not mentioned in the git diff and does not seem necessary given the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets to check, which are not actionable in the context of fixing the issue and do not provide additional value. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
