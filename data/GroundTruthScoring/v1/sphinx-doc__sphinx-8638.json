    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is about instance variables linking to other variables of the same name in the project. The RESPONSE provides general troubleshooting steps for Sphinx documentation issues, but it does not offer any actionable guidance related to the problem of autolinking instance variables to unrelated variables. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking various code snippets from the Sphinx repository, but none of these suggestions align with the changes made in the git diff, which specifically modifies the 'variable' field in the 'PyObject' class within 'python.py' to address the autolinking issue. The RESPONSE fails to provide any insights or actionable steps that would assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff, and therefore it does not offer any real value in the context of the git diff.",
