    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests increasing the default `max_iter` parameter in the `LogisticRegressionCV` class and ensuring that a convergence check is performed after the optimization routine. While these suggestions are related to the issue of convergence warnings, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the condition under which warnings are issued in two separate files (`logistic.py` and `base.py`) by removing the `verbose > 0` check, ensuring that warnings are always issued when the algorithm fails to converge, regardless of the verbosity setting. The RESPONSE does not address this change and instead focuses on increasing the `max_iter` parameter and adding new checks, which is not what the git diff indicates. The RESPONSE does correctly suggest issuing a `ConvergenceWarning`, which is in line with the git diff, but the overall approach does not match the git diff's solution to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
