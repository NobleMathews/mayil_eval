    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing the `RenameIndex` operation in a backwards compatible way, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes within the `autodetector.py` file, specifically focusing on the detection and handling of renamed fields and indexes, as well as the generation of operations related to these changes. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifications to the `RenameIndex` class and its methods, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a pseudo-code outline for the `database_forwards` method, which is not part of the git diff's changes. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2.",
