{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the issue is related to variable redeclaration in the generated Cython code when using `ufuncify` with the Cython backend. It also correctly points out that the `_y` variable is redeclared, which is part of the problem described in the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the `autowrap.py` file, including the use of a new method `_string_var` to handle variable names and ensure they are correctly declared and used within the Cython code. The RESPONSE does not mention this method or the changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `_prototype_arg`, `_declare_arg`, `_call_arg`, and `dump_pyx` methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests checking the code generation logic and modifying the code generation template or logic, which is a general approach and does not offer the specific, actionable steps shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the nature of the issue but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
