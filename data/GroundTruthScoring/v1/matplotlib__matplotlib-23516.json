    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue described, which involves color settings being ignored in a scatter plot unless the 'c' parameter is given. The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the '_parse_scatter_color_args' function to ensure that 'cmap', 'norm', 'vmin', and 'vmax' parameters are handled correctly even when 'c' is not provided, which aligns with the issue's description of the problem. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the code should not default to a single color or use 'get_next_color_func()' when 'c' is not provided, which is in line with the git diff's approach to providing a warning when color-related parameters are given but 'c' is not. However, the RESPONSE does not mention adding a warning, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Instead, it focuses on ensuring that the colormap is applied correctly. The RESPONSE also provides links to specific code snippets that may need to be reviewed or modified, which is helpful for the developer. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach, but it does not include the aspect of adding a warning, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
