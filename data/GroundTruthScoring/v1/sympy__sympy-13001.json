    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies that the issue is related to the `cse` function not returning an expression equivalent to `eq` and that `-4*a**2` is represented as `Mul(-1, 4, a**2, evaluate=False)`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution to the problem. Instead, it offers general advice to modify the `cse` function to handle unevaluated expressions correctly or to adjust the comparison logic. The RESPONSE suggests checking code snippets that are not directly related to the changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the `_rebuild` function in `cse_main.py` and the `ode_Riccati_special_minus2` function in `ode.py`, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, and the suggested code snippets do not offer a clear path to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
