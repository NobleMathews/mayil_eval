    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_validate_data' method and introducing a new parameter value 'validate='array-or-frame''. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes involve modifying the '__init__' method to set 'validate' to 'None' by default and adding a new '_check_input' method to handle the deprecation warning and input validation. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the deprecation cycle and the validation logic. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use 'validate='array-or-frame'' is not supported by the git diff, which does not introduce such a parameter value. The RESPONSE does mention adding a deprecation warning and updating documentation, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff, but the core of the RESPONSE's suggested changes does not match the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
