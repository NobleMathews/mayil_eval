    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'get_queryset' method to conditionally apply 'distinct()' based on whether a delete action is being performed. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, which involves a problem with the 'distinct()' method being incompatible with 'delete()'. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff removes the 'Exists' import and refactors the 'get_queryset' method to apply 'distinct()' only when necessary, and it also modifies the error message in 'query.py' to be more specific about the use of 'distinct(*fields)'. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check for a delete action in the 'request' object is not present in the git diff, and it does not address the changes made in 'query.py'. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by focusing on the 'distinct()' method, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the issue.",
