    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the nature of the error, which is the use of a method as if it were a subscriptable object. It also correctly suggests that the `GeoAxes` class likely overrides the `axis` method, which is causing the issue. The RESPONSE provides two actionable solutions: modifying the `GeoAxes` class to return an object that supports subscripting or adjusting the `_tick_only` function to handle non-subscriptable `ax.axis`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or mention the use of `MethodType` to check if `ax.axis` is a method, which is a key part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the implementation of the `axis` method in the `GeoAxes` class, which is not directly related to the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks the specificity and direct code changes present in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it offers a partially relevant solution but does not match the git diff closely.",
