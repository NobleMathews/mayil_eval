    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a workaround for the issue by suggesting an addition to the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration in `conf.py`. This is actionable advice that could potentially resolve the issue of Sphinx not correctly resolving the `struct.Struct` type annotation. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows changes to the `sphinx/util/typing.py` file to handle the `struct.Struct` class directly within the Sphinx codebase. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Sphinx source code, which is the approach taken in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a workaround that could help the developer, it does not match the git diff's approach of fixing the issue at the source code level. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the same issue but does not provide a complete solution in line with the git diff.",
