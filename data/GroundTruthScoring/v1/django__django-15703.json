    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to deprecate `Model.Meta.index_together` in favor of `Model.Meta.indexes` and the `Index` class in Django. It suggests updating model definitions, the migration autodetector, and the schema editor, as well as adding checks and deprecation warnings. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or directly address the git diff provided. The git diff shows the actual changes made to the Django codebase, including adding a deprecation warning in `options.py` and a system check deprecated details in `models.py`. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or files, and instead, it provides a general guide and pseudo-code that does not align closely with the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the deprecation process, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff, which is why it receives a score of 3.",
