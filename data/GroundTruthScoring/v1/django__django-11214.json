    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the range object with a tuple in the CheckConstraint definition, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the serializer has been modified to handle range objects correctly by adding 'range' to the tuple of types that BaseSimpleSerializer can handle. The RESPONSE does not address the actual issue of the serializer's inability to handle range objects and instead suggests a workaround that does not solve the underlying problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to various parts of the Django codebase, but these do not offer direct solutions to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
