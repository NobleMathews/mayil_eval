    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying various parts of the row reduction logic in `sympy/matrices/reductions.py`, including the rank determination logic, the `iszerofunc`, and the `normalize_last` and `normalize` flags. It also recommends checking the logic in `_find_reasonable_pivot` and adding debug statements if necessary.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix was made in `sympy/polys/matrices/normalforms.py` by adjusting the loop that processes the rows of the matrix and adding a condition to break out of the loop if the maximum number of pivots has been reached. This indicates that the issue was not with the row reduction logic itself but with the way the rows were being processed in the `_hermite_normal_form` function.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes to the `_hermite_normal_form` function or the loop that processes the rows, which is the core of the solution in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the general area of matrix reduction but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue of the loop handling in the `_hermite_normal_form` function.",
