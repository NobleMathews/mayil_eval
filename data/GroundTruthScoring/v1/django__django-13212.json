    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to modify the validators to include the provided value in the ValidationError messages, which is the core of the issue. It suggests adding the 'value' to the 'params' dictionary when raising ValidationError and updating the error messages to include a '%(value)s' placeholder. This approach is in line with the git diff, which shows the exact changes made to include the 'value' in the 'params' and the corresponding updates to the error messages.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides an example of how to modify the BaseValidator and its subclasses, as well as instructions for validators that do not inherit from BaseValidator, such as EmailValidator. This guidance is actionable and relevant to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it achieves the same result by providing a viable alternative approach to including the provided value in ValidationError messages. The RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the validate method from the DecimalField class in django/forms/fields.py, which is included in the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the main focus of the issue is on the inclusion of the provided value in ValidationError messages, not on the specific implementation details of the DecimalField class.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, making it deserving of a score of 9.",
