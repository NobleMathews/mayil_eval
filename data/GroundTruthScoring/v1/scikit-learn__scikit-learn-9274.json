    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the classes and methods that need to be modified, which aligns with the git diff. It correctly points out the need to pass the 'max_iter' parameter to the '_optimize_lbfgs' method and to use 'maxiter' correctly when calling the L-BFGS optimizer, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also mentions the need to replace 'max_fun' with 'max_iter' if it is being used incorrectly, which is a change made in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises to ensure that 'n_iter_' is set to the actual number of iterations performed, which is also addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE further suggests checking the documentation for consistency, which is reflected in the git diff by the addition of the 'max_fun' parameter documentation in the class docstrings. Overall, the RESPONSE provides a comprehensive and accurate solution that matches the git diff in addressing the issue.",
