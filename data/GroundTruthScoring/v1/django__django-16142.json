{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code modifications that align closely with the git diff. It suggests removing the fallback to `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` in the `get_language_from_request` function and modifying it to return `None` if no language is found, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes pseudocode for handling the fallback logic in the middleware, which is in line with the git diff's introduction of a `get_fallback_language` method in the `LocaleMiddleware` class. The RESPONSE does not include the exact implementation of the `get_fallback_language` method, but it does suggest adding logic to determine the fallback language based on TLD, which is the intent of the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the middleware should handle the fallback logic, which is a key aspect of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the changes to the `process_response` method seen in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue, hence the score of 8.",
