{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that are relevant to the issue described. It suggests reviewing the `install_repl_displayhook` function, which is directly related to the changes made in the git diff, where the call to `install_repl_displayhook` was moved. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that `matplotlib.is_interactive()` returns `True` and that `draw_all` functions correctly, which are relevant to the interactive drawing issue described. Additionally, it suggests checking the commit for changes that affect the event loop integration with IPython, which is a reasonable step given the nature of the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest the relocation of the `install_repl_displayhook` call as shown in the git diff, which is a key change to fix the issue. Instead, it focuses on reviewing and verifying the existing code and the impact of the problematic commit. While the RESPONSE is on the right track and would likely lead to a similar conclusion as the git diff, it does not provide the specific solution of moving the `install_repl_displayhook` call.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns well with the git diff, but it does not precisely match the git diff's approach to the issue. A score of 7 is appropriate as it provides actionable advice that would likely lead to resolving the issue, even though it does not explicitly state the solution presented in the git diff.",
