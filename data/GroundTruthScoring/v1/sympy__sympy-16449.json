    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps to implement the CDF for the Maxwell distribution, which is the specific issue described. It provides a clear and detailed explanation, including the formula for the CDF in terms of the error function `erf` and the square root function `sqrt`, which matches the git diff's implementation of the `_cdf` method for the Maxwell distribution. The RESPONSE also correctly advises importing the `erf` function, which is consistent with the git diff that adds `atan` to the imports, indicating that a new function is being used in the file. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides pseudo code that is in line with the git diff's changes, offering a valid and effective alternative approach to the same problem. The RESPONSE also includes helpful references to the codebase, which would assist the developer in locating where to implement the changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and achieves similar results.",
