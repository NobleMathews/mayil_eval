    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` class to use the error message key \"invalid_list\" instead of \"list\". The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating the `default_error_messages` dictionary and any `ValidationError` calls that reference the old \"list\" key to use \"invalid_list\" instead. This matches the changes made in the git diff, which includes the renaming of the error message key and the addition of a deprecation warning for the old key. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the deprecation warning, which is a minor omission but does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate as the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
