    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some general advice on how to address the `TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'test_method'` by ensuring correct inheritance from `unittest.TestCase` and handling of the `__init__` method. This is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not directly address the specific problem in the git diff, which involves adding a `_getobj` method to the `TestCaseFunction` class to ensure that the `obj` attribute returns the correct bound method. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes related to the `_getobj` method or the `TestCaseFunction` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE also addresses the `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use` by suggesting a mechanism to check if the port is available before attempting to listen on it. However, this part of the RESPONSE is not relevant to the git diff or the main issue described, which is focused on the `TypeError` during the pytest run.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides a link to a code snippet that is not directly related to the issue or the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
