    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `glossary.rst` file to ensure that terms 'MySQL' and 'mysql' are not considered duplicates by Sphinx due to case insensitivity, and offers a workaround by disambiguating the terms or removing one if unnecessary. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which implements a solution within the Sphinx codebase itself to handle case-sensitive term resolution. The RESPONSE does not address modifying the Sphinx source code, which is the core of the git diff's solution. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of case sensitivity in terms, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach of modifying the Sphinx resolver functions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally helpful and does not offer a solution that would resolve the issue in the same manner as the git diff.",
