    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that each `City` instance has its `country` attribute set to a `Country` instance that has already been saved and has a primary key before calling `bulk_create`. This advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it addresses the need for related `Country` instances to have valid primary keys before they are used in `bulk_create`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a new method `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` and modifies existing methods to use this new method to handle the preparation of related fields for saving operations, including `bulk_create`.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention or account for the refactoring done in the git diff, which abstracts the logic into a separate method to prevent data loss due to unsaved related objects. Instead, it provides a more manual approach to handling the issue, which is not as elegant or maintainable as the solution in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly actionable or relevant to implementing the solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
