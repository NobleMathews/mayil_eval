    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is with the `parse_expr` function not respecting the `evaluate=False` parameter for expressions under `sqrt` and provides a general approach to investigate and fix the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows changes in two files: `complexes.py` and `sympy_parser.py`. In `complexes.py`, the diff modifies the `doit` method of the `sign` class to ensure that it returns the correct result when `is_zero` is `False`. In `sympy_parser.py`, the diff adds a list of functions and modifies the `visit_Call` method to append `evaluate=False` to the function calls if they are in the list of functions. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the `sign` class, and it incorrectly identifies the `sqrt` function as the source of the issue. The RESPONSE also provides incorrect file paths and line numbers that do not exist in the git repository, which could mislead the developer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies that there is an issue with evaluation, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 1.",
