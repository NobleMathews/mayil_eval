    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests updating the docstring and reporting the issue to the Sphinx project, which does not address the code changes needed to fix the issue. The git diff shows specific changes to the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` file, which involve modifying the handling of `*args` and `**kwargs` in the code to prevent duplication and incomplete documentation. The RESPONSE fails to mention any code changes or adjustments to the Sphinx extension code, which is the core of the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests manually editing the generated documentation as a workaround, which is not a sustainable or correct approach to solving the problem in the codebase. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any insights or aid developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff and should receive a score of 0.",
