{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff. It suggests reviewing and modifying the `AppConfig.create` method, which is indeed part of the solution as seen in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle cases where `default_app_config` is specified but the corresponding `apps.py` is missing or empty, which is the core issue. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `populate` method and catching `UnboundLocalError`, which is not part of the git diff solution. The git diff shows that the solution involves initializing `app_config_name` to `None` and modifying the error message logic, not catching exceptions. The RESPONSE also suggests updating a test case, which is not reflected in the git diff but is a good practice. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, such as the specific error message update, but it does provide a partial solution to the issue. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate as the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
