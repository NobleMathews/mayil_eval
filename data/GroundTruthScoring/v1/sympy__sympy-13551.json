    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is due to operator precedence and proposes adding parentheses to the expression inside the `Product` function. However, the git diff indicates that the solution involves importing the `Sum` class and using the `exp` and `log` functions to correctly evaluate the product. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. The code snippet provided in the RESPONSE is also incorrect and does not address the problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
