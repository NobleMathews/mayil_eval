    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying a method called `visit_BinOp` in `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` to handle the `ast.Pow` node, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead adds a dictionary called `OPERATORS` that maps AST node classes to their string representations and modifies the `unparse` function to handle various AST nodes, including `ast.BinOp`, `ast.BoolOp`, and `ast.UnaryOp`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the power operator `**` and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the actual changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
