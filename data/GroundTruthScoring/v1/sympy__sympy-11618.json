    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to identify and modify the `distance` method in the `Point` class or its subclasses to correctly calculate the Euclidean distance considering all dimensions. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the `distance` method to handle different dimensions correctly. However, the RESPONSE suggests implementing a separate method for `Point3D` if it doesn't exist, which is not necessary according to the git diff, as the git diff shows a generic solution that works for any number of dimensions within the existing `distance` method. The RESPONSE also suggests raising a `TypeError` if the other object is not a `Point3D`, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead handles the case where the dimensions of the points do not match by padding the shorter point with zeros. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but these are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but does not fully align with the git diff.",
