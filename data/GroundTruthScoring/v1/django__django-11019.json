{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of merging media objects and the incorrect raising of `MediaOrderConflictWarning`. It suggests updating the `Media.merge` method and using `TopologicalSorter` to resolve the order of JS files, which is in line with the git diff's approach of using `stable_topological_sort` from `django.utils.topological_sort`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `__add__ method in the `Media` class to use the updated `merge` method for combining `_js_lists`, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to the `__add__` method and the `merge` function.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation details, such as using `OrderedSet` and handling `CyclicDependencyError`, but it does align with the overall approach of using topological sorting to resolve the order of media files without unnecessary warnings. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer to locate the areas that need changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE could have been more explicit about the removal of the old merging logic and the introduction of `defaultdict` for the `_css` property, which are present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's main focus on the `merge` method and the correct handling of JS file ordering is the core of the issue and is addressed effectively. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its high relevance and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
