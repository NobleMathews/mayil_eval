    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable suggestions to address the issue with the colorbar in matplotlib. It suggests ensuring that the 'mappable' object is associated with the Axes before calling 'plt.colorbar()', which is relevant to the issue but does not directly address the change in behavior from matplotlib 3.5.1 to 3.6.0. The suggestion to uncomment and use 'ax.inset_axes()' is also actionable but does not align with the git diff, which does not modify the user's code but rather the matplotlib library code. The advice to explicitly specify the 'ax' argument is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which sets 'ax = self.gca()' as a fallback. However, the RESPONSE does not reflect the change in the library code that turns the error into a deprecation warning, which is a key aspect of the git diff. The suggestion to downgrade to an earlier version of matplotlib is a valid workaround but does not contribute to fixing the issue in the current version. The RESPONSE also includes links to specific lines of code in the matplotlib repository, which could help the developer understand where the issue is occurring, but it does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach of modifying the library to issue a deprecation warning instead of an error.",
