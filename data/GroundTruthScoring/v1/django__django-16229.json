    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting the 'show_hidden_initial' property to 'False' in the 'RelatedModelInline' class and ensuring proper validation in the 'clean' method of the 'RelatedModelForm'. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of validation being bypassed, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in the 'as_widget' method of the 'BoundField' class in Django, specifically handling the propagation of hidden initial values. The RESPONSE does not mention or address the changes in the 'as_widget' method, nor does it provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses validation issues, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
