    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `__eq__` method and other comparison methods in the `Rational` class to handle comparisons with `sympy.pi` and other irrational numbers correctly, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of incorrect comparisons between rational and irrational numbers. However, the RESPONSE lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the comparison methods, including the use of `is_NumberSymbol`, `is_Float`, `is_Number`, and additional handling for `is_Rational` and not `is_Integer`. The RESPONSE does not provide any of these specific details or code changes. Instead, it suggests a general approach of using `evalf()` for comparisons, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests checking if the issue persists in the latest version of SymPy and updating if necessary, which is not related to the actual code changes needed to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
