{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and accurate explanation of the issue with the `is_closed` and `is_open` properties for `S.Rationals` in SymPy. It correctly identifies that the current behavior is incorrect and offers two alternative solutions: one to explicitly set both properties to `False`, and another to raise a `NotImplementedError` if the properties are meant to be undefined.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns closely with the git diff, which also modifies the `is_open` method to return `False` for `S.Rationals` and updates the `is_closed` property accordingly. The git diff includes additional changes to the handling of unions with `S.Rationals` and other sets, which the RESPONSE does not address, but these changes are not directly related to the issue of the `is_closed` and `is_open` properties being incorrectly initialized.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's implementation but offers a valid and effective alternative approach to resolving the issue. It provides actionable guidance that would enable a developer to fix the issue in a manner consistent with the git diff's intent. Therefore, it receives a high score for its relevance and utility.",
