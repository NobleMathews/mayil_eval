    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `migrate` command to prevent `pre_migrate` and `post_migrate` signals from being emitted when the `--check` flag is used and the database is up-to-date. It also addresses the issue of updating the logging to clearly indicate check mode. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific changes made to the code. The git diff shows changes to the handling of the `--plan` option and the exit behavior when `--check_unapplied` is true, while the RESPONSE focuses on modifying signal emissions and logging, which are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly suggest ensuring that `sys.exit(1)` is called when `--check` is used and there are migrations to apply, which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not address the changes to the `--plan` option handling, which is a significant part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff.",
