    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting that the developer should ensure the `Child` instance is saved and has a primary key before assigning it to the `Parent` instance, and then update the `Parent` instance's `child_id` field directly with the `Child` instance's ID before calling `bulk_update`. This advice is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method to include a check for fields and adds a call to this method in the `bulk_update` function to ensure related fields are prepared for saving.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `fields` parameter to the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method or the loop over `objs` in the `bulk_update` method to call `_prepare_related_fields_for_save`. Instead, it suggests a workaround that involves manual assignment of the `child_id` before the `bulk_update` call. While this workaround could potentially resolve the issue, it does not encapsulate the changes in the git diff that automate the process within the Django framework.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant because it addresses the issue of ensuring that the `Child` instance's ID is correctly associated with the `Parent` instance before the `bulk_update` operation. However, it is incomplete as it does not incorporate the automated solution provided by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 4 for offering some actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff but does not fully match the automated approach suggested by the diff.",
