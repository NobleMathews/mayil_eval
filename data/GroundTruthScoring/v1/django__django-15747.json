    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice to address the issue of a FieldError being raised when attempting to update a queryset ordered by an annotated field. The first suggestion to clear the ordering before performing the update is a valid workaround that could prevent the FieldError from occurring. However, this does not align with the git diff, which modifies the Django framework to handle the update internally when ordered by an annotated field, rather than requiring the user to clear the ordering manually.\n\nThe second suggestion to iterate over the queryset and update each instance individually is a less efficient workaround that could lead to performance issues, especially with large querysets. This approach does not align with the git diff's solution, which aims to handle the update in a more efficient manner within the Django framework itself.\n\nThe third suggestion to ensure that the `get_queryset` method does not return a queryset with annotations that are incompatible with the `update` method is somewhat aligned with the git diff's intent to handle updates with annotated fields properly. However, it does not provide a direct solution to the problem and instead advises caution in using annotations.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that could help prevent the FieldError in the short term but does not align closely with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue within the Django framework. Therefore, it is partially relevant and incomplete in addressing the issue as described in the git diff.",
