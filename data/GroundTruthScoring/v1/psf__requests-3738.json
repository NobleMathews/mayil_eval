    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is to ensure that the `prepare_url` method in `requests/models.py` handles non-standard schemes like `http+unix`. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the conditional check to include or properly handle the `http+unix` scheme, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that closely resembles the git diff, suggesting an adjustment to the condition to allow the `http+unix` scheme to go through the URL preparation logic. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests adding an explicit check for `http+unix`, whereas the git diff removes the exclusion of all non-HTTP schemes except for `http`. Despite this, the RESPONSE's suggestion would still achieve a similar result to the git diff by allowing `http+unix` URLs to be processed. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for the developer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
