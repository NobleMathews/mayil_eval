    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `w_0` property to account for the refractive index change, which aligns with the issue's description of the need to consider the refractive index in the beam waist calculation. However, the RESPONSE introduces a new parameter `n_2` for the `w_0` method, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead adds a new parameter `n` to the `__new__` method of the `BeamParameter` class and uses it throughout the class to account for the refractive index, including in the `w_0` property and the `waist2rayleigh` utility function. The RESPONSE does not mention updating the constructor or the utility function, which are key parts of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to pass `n_2` to the `w_0` method wherever it is called is not reflected in the git diff, which implies that the refractive index should be set once during object instantiation. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need to consider the refractive index but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
