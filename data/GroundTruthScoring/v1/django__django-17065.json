    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `build_widget_attrs` method to ensure that the `aria-describedby` attribute in `attrs` is not overwritten, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the check for `self.field.help_text` and `self.id_for_label` should only add `aria-describedby` if it is not already specified in `attrs`, which is in line with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE includes a code snippet that reflects the necessary changes, which is actionable and provides clear guidance. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's implementation, which uses a more complex condition to check for the presence of `aria-describedby` in both `attrs` and `widget.attrs`. However, the RESPONSE's solution is still effective and relevant, achieving the same result as the git diff. Therefore, it is scored a 9, as it offers a slightly simplified but still valid alternative to the git diff.",
