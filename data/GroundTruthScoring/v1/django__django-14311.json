    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described, which is the incorrect handling of the '-m' module argument by the autoreloader when a dotted module name is used. The RESPONSE's proposed changes to the `get_child_arguments` function closely align with the git diff, including the check for `__spec__.name` and the conditional logic to determine the correct module name to use. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle cases where the module name ends with `.__main__`, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests stripping off `.__main__` to get the full module name, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff does not strip off `.__main__` but instead uses the `spec.parent` when `spec.name` ends with `.__main__`. This difference in approach does not necessarily mean the RESPONSE is incorrect, but it does not exactly match the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for further review, which are not directly related to the changes but could be useful for context.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff, but with a slight variation in the approach to handling the module name ending with `.__main__`. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
