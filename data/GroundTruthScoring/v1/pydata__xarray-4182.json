    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of pre-expanding data and attributes in the DataArray/Variable HTML representation. It correctly identifies the need to modify the HTML generation code and suggests setting the checkboxes for data and attributes as checked by default, which aligns with the git diff's approach of setting the 'collapsed' variable to 'checked'.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly points out the need to update the JavaScript/CSS logic if necessary, which is a valid consideration even though the git diff does not show any changes to JavaScript/CSS files. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact file and line numbers to change, but it provides a high-level overview and a pseudo code snippet that would lead to a similar outcome as the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes additional guidance on verifying CSS rules and testing the changes, which are not part of the git diff but are relevant and useful for ensuring the feature works as intended. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact location of the change as the git diff does, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the change required, which could potentially lead to confusion, but this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
