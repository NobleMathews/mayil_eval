    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the issue with the `SimpleImputer` class when `missing_values=0` and the input is a `sparse.csc_matrix`. However, the proposed solution does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff removes the condition that raises a `ValueError` when `missing_values=0` for sparse matrices and instead provides a new implementation for handling sparse data in the `_sparse_fit` method. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_sparse_fit` method but includes a condition that checks for `missing_values == 0` and creates a `missing_mask`, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces a new attribute `keep_empty_features` which is not mentioned in the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE also includes a call to `super()._fit_indicator(missing_mask)` which is not part of the git diff's solution. While the RESPONSE attempts to address the issue, it does not provide a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff's changes or the specific problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE also includes unnecessary code snippets and links to the sklearn repository, which do not add value to the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it acknowledges the issue but provides a solution that is not closely aligned with the git diff and includes additional unrelated elements.",
