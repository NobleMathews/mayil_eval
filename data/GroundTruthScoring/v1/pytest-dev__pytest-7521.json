Instead, it suggests updating the test to handle the change in behavior or to modify the test to accommodate the new behavior. This does not address the underlying issue of `capfd.readouterr()` converting carriage returns to newlines, which is what the git diff aims to fix by adding `newline=\"\"` to the `open()` call in the `capture.py` file. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to various parts of the repository that do not pertain to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE fails to assist the developer in fixing the issue as described and does not align with the git diff provided.",
