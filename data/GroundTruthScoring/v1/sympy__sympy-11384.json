    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of printing the formal power series correctly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `FormalPowerSeries` class to include a custom string representation method, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows changes in the `_print_FormalPowerSeries` methods of the `latex.py` and `pretty.py` files, which are responsible for the printing behavior of the series. The RESPONSE does not address these methods or files. Instead, it suggests implementing a `__str__` or `__repr__` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff and does not directly address the printing format issue described in the ISSUE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests raising an exception for cases where `fps` cannot compute the series, which is somewhat relevant to the side question in the ISSUE but does not align with the git diff, which does not include any changes related to exception handling. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. However, it does touch on the broader topic of improving the representation of the formal power series, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
