    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several changes to the `UpdateQuery` class and the handling of updates in the `Child` model, which are somewhat relevant to the issue of incorrect behavior during queryset updates with multiple inheritance. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically modifies the `pre_sql_setup` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and the `get_related_updates` method in `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py` to handle the related updates and ensure that the correct ancestor models are updated.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to check the model's `_meta.concrete_model` and to ensure that the `Child` class does not have its own primary key field are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to override the `save` method in the `Child` model is not supported by the git diff and does not address the core issue of the queryset update behavior.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does provide some relevant information regarding the handling of updates in models with multiple inheritance, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
