    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of code-blocks being printed out of margin in LaTeX.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `sphinx/writers/latex.py` file to handle long hex strings in LaTeX code-blocks by implementing a custom LaTeX command to allow line breaks within hex strings and using the `\\allowbreak` command. However, the git diff provided does not reflect these changes. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to the handling of footnotes and footnotetexts in LaTeX, with no mention of handling long hex strings or implementing custom LaTeX commands for line breaks.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, as it addresses a different aspect of LaTeX rendering (line breaks in hex strings) rather than the footnote handling that the git diff modifies. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach to the issue, as it does not address the specific problem of footnotes and footnotetexts that the git diff aims to resolve.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance relevant to the git diff or the issue described, and it does not offer an effective alternative solution.",
