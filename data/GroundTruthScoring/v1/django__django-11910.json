    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests manually updating the migration file to correct the `to_field` parameter after a primary key has been renamed. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the Django migration autodetector code to automatically handle the repointing of the `ForeignKey`'s `to_field` parameter when a primary key is renamed. The RESPONSE does not address the need to modify the autodetector code and instead provides an alternative that would require manual intervention every time a primary key is renamed, which is not a scalable or maintainable solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the actionable change needed to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach.",
