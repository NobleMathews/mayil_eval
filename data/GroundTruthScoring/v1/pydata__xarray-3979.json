    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the `fill_value` argument in the `xr.full_like` function call to be a scalar value instead of a numpy array. This advice is not aligned with the git diff, which instead adds a check to raise a ValueError if the `fill_value` is not scalar, indicating that the function should not support non-scalar fill values at all. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described, which is about handling non-scalar fill values when `other` is a chunked dask array. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not exist in the provided context. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches upon the nature of the `fill_value` but fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff or the issue description. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and utility.",
