    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__deepcopy__` method in the `DataArray` class to handle circular references properly and to use a memoization dictionary to avoid infinite recursion. It also mentions updating the `copy` method in the `Variable` class to handle circular references correctly. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of circular references causing a `RecursionError`, it does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a comprehensive refactoring of the copy methods across multiple classes (`DataArray`, `Dataset`, `Variable`) to use a new `_copy` method that includes a `memo` parameter to handle circular references. The RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of a new `_copy` method or the refactoring of existing methods to use this new method. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests custom handling for `ancillary_variables` which is not present in the git diff, and it does not provide a concrete implementation for this suggestion. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of circular references and recursion, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
