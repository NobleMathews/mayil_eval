    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a detailed explanation and a code snippet that aligns closely with the git diff provided. It suggests adding a new method `get_shape` to the `AxesImage` class and modifying the `__str__` method to use this new method, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that `get_shape` should return the shape of the image data, including depth if applicable, which matches the git diff's implementation that includes the number of channels in the shape.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by providing additional context and resources for understanding the changes, such as referencing the Matplotlib and NumPy documentation, and Python's official documentation for the `__str__` method. It also suggests adding unit tests to verify the new behavior, which is a best practice in software development but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score is that it includes a conditional return of `None` in the `get_shape` method for cases where image data is not set, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as it provides a viable alternative approach to handling uninitialized image data and still aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
