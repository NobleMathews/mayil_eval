    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 1 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the Docker configuration, verifying volume mounts, and potentially downgrading Django as a workaround. It also suggests disabling the autoreload feature as a last resort. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves modifying the Django source code to handle the path resolution issue within the autoreload and translation reloader modules. The RESPONSE does not address the need to modify the Django source code, which is the core of the solution according to the git diff. Instead, it focuses on Docker-related configurations and workarounds that do not align with the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it acknowledges the issue with file path resolution, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
