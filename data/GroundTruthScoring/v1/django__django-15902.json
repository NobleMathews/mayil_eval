    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the rendering process for the ManagementForm to use a custom template that does not trigger the deprecation warning, which aligns with the git diff's approach of specifying a template to avoid the warning. The RESPONSE provides a pseudo-code example that demonstrates how to implement a custom renderer and template for the ManagementForm, which is a practical and relevant solution to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest adding a 'template_name' attribute to the ManagementForm class as the git diff does. Instead, it proposes a more complex solution involving a custom renderer. While this is a valid approach, it is not as straightforward as the change shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a relevant and actionable solution that achieves a similar result to the git diff but through a different method.",
