    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance to resolve the issue. It suggests modifying the `assert_no_index_corrupted` function and updating the `drop_vars` method, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows that the actual solution involves adding a new function `_maybe_drop_multiindex_coords` and modifying the `update` and `assign` methods to call this new function before updating coordinates. Additionally, the git diff includes changes to the `drop_coords` function to handle the dropping of MultiIndex variables and issue a deprecation warning, which the RESPONSE does not mention. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not relevant to the actual changes needed. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any insights or actionable steps that would assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff and should receive a score of 0.",
