    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the renormalization step or making it conditional based on a new parameter `renormalize`. This does not align with the git diff, which does not remove the renormalization step but instead adds a warning when the predictions do not sum to one. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a new parameter is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not address the deprecation of the `eps` parameter or the addition of warnings for the use of `eps` and the sum of predictions not equaling one. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of renormalization in `log_loss`, but it fails to match the git diff's approach and does not provide a complete or effective alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
