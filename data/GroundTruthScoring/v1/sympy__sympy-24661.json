{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `parse_expr` function and the `EvaluateFalseTransformer` class to respect the `evaluate=False` flag for relational expressions, which is the core issue. The RESPONSE also suggests checking if the `EvaluateFalseTransformer` is correctly applied when `evaluate=False` is passed, which is a relevant step in ensuring the issue is resolved.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's approach of adding a new method to handle relational operators, but it does suggest ensuring that the `EvaluateFalseTransformer` class properly transforms relational operators, which is effectively what the git diff achieves with the new `visit_Compare` method. The RESPONSE's suggestion to review or modify the `EvaluateFalseTransformer` class to handle relationals correctly is a viable alternative to the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets, which would be helpful for the developer to locate the parts of the code that need to be addressed. This additional guidance supports the developer in fixing the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not explicitly mention the addition of a dictionary for relational operators and the specific implementation of the `visit_Compare` method as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is valid and would likely lead to a similar outcome as the git diff, making it highly valuable for resolving the issue.",
