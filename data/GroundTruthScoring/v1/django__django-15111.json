    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to modify the `fetch_remote_template` function to set the 'User Agent' header to `Django/DJANGO_VERSION`, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to set a custom User Agent. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff shows that `build_opener` from `urllib.request` is used instead of `Request`, and the User Agent is set directly on the opener object. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests importing `get_version` from `django`, which is not present in the git diff; instead, the git diff uses `django.__version__` directly. The RESPONSE also does not include the use of a context manager to open the URL and write the content to a file, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks completeness and does not closely match the git diff's approach.",
