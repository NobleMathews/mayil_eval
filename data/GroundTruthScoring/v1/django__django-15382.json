    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to the issue by suggesting modifications to the `as_sql` method in the `Exists` class and handling the `EmptyResultSet` in `compiler.py`. It correctly identifies the relevant files and methods that need to be addressed, which is in line with the git diff provided. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of wrapping the `super().as_sql` call in a try-except block to handle the `EmptyResultSet` exception specifically within the `as_sql` method of the `Exists` class. Instead, it suggests raising the `EmptyResultSet` when the queryset is empty and handling it in a different method (`as_subquery_condition`), which is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code sections, but these are not directly related to the actionable changes needed to fix the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but does not provide a complete or direct solution to the issue as the git diff does.",
