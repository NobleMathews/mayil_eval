{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the `_html_output` method modifying `self._errors` for `NON_FIELD_ERRORS` and suggests a fix that aligns closely with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE correctly advises to make a copy of the error list before adding hidden field errors, which is the same approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides a hypothetical code change that would resolve the issue, which is conceptually similar to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation details, such as the specific method names and lines of code to change, but it does offer a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE also includes additional information about where to find relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. The RESPONSE is not scored a perfect 10 because it does not directly reference the changes to the `ErrorList` class in `django/forms/utils.py` that are also part of the git diff, but it does address the main issue effectively.",
