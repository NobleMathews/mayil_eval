{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `simplify_regex` function to handle metacharacters and proposes using an `ESCAPE_MAPPINGS` dictionary from a different file (`django/utils/regex_helper.py`) which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff introduces a new function `replace_metacharacters` to handle the removal of unescaped metacharacters directly within the `simplify_regex` function, which is a different approach than the one suggested in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding a new function and instead suggests modifying the existing `simplify_regex` function using a dictionary mapping that is not part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to use `re.sub` for replacement is somewhat aligned with the git diff's use of `re.sub` within the new function, the overall approach and the use of an external dictionary for mappings are not aligned with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of handling metacharacters in regex patterns, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
