    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `parse_datetime` function to use `python-dateutil` instead of the current regex-based parsing, which is a significant departure from the git diff's approach. The git diff shows a simple regex modification to allow whitespace before the timezone information, which is a direct and minimal change to address the issue. The RESPONSE, however, proposes a more extensive change by introducing a new dependency and rewriting the function, which is not aligned with the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE does address the issue of supporting spaces as separators in ISO-8601 datetime strings, which is relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach. Instead, it suggests a different strategy that involves adding a new library dependency and refactoring the existing function.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes irrelevant information about updating locale format files, which is not related to the regex change shown in the git diff and does not contribute to resolving the issue described. This part of the RESPONSE does not add value to the developer looking to fix the issue based on the git diff provided.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not offer actionable content that aligns with the git diff, and it includes unnecessary suggestions that do not pertain to the specific issue at hand. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
