    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_resolve_lookup` function to handle cases where `inspect.signature` fails for built-in types, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to catch a `ValueError` and set `current` to `context.template.engine.string_if_invalid` when this exception occurs. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises testing the changes with relevant template code, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's structure of the try-except blocks, but it achieves the same result, which is to handle the exception and prevent the crash. The RESPONSE also includes a helpful suggestion to check if `string_if_invalid` is properly set, which is not part of the git diff but is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the logging part of the git diff, which is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
