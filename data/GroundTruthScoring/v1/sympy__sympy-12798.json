    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff, addressing the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reverting changes made to the `ff` and `rf` functions based on a pull request and restoring previous behavior. However, the git diff provided does not indicate a simple reversion to a previous state. Instead, the git diff shows a refactoring and enhancement of the `RisingFactorial` and `FallingFactorial` classes, including changes to the way polynomials are handled (using `Poly` instead of `poly_from_expr`) and updates to the documentation and examples.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of imports for `poly_from_expr` and `PolificationFailed`, the introduction of `Poly`, and the modifications to the evaluation logic within the `RisingFactorial` and `FallingFactorial` classes. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance or alternative solutions that would help a developer implement the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer any relevant or actionable information to assist in resolving the issue. It does not address the refactoring and enhancements made to the `ff` and `rf` functions, nor does it reflect the updated handling of polynomials or the documentation changes. As a result, the RESPONSE is not helpful in the context of the git diff and the issue described.",
