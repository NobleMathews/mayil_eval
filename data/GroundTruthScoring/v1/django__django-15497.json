    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new middleware to handle the `x-forwarded-proto` header, which is a reasonable approach but does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff modifies the `scheme` method within the `HttpRequest` class to handle the header directly, rather than introducing new middleware. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use the left-most value aligns with the git diff's approach of splitting the header value and using the first part. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific implementation details shown in the git diff, such as stripping whitespace or the exact location of the change within the `HttpRequest` class. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for further reference, which could be helpful for understanding related concepts but do not directly contribute to solving the issue at hand.",
