    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `canonical` method in `sympy/core/relational.py` is idempotent and provides general advice on checking and modifying the implementation to achieve a stable result. However, it does not provide specific actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows a concrete implementation change, where the logic for determining the canonical form of a relational expression is altered to ensure that a number is on the right-hand side or the arguments are ordered, without any other simplification attempts. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the logic behind them. It does, however, correctly identify the need for idempotence in the `canonical` method and the importance of handling division and negation consistently, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets for review, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code but does not directly address the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it provides some relevant advice but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
