    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `mpl._replacer` function to issue a warning when a `KeyError` occurs, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of confusing error messages. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `mpl._replacer` function. Instead, the git diff focuses on modifying the `_process_plot_format` function and related error handling within the plotting methods to provide clearer error messages when a format string is confused with a data key.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as adding the `ambiguous_fmt_datakey` parameter or updating the error messages to be more informative in the context of potential data key confusion. The RESPONSE's suggestion to issue a warning is a reasonable approach to improving error clarity, but it does not align with the specific changes in the git diff that are aimed at addressing the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff, and it does not provide guidance on the changes to the error handling logic that are central to the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
