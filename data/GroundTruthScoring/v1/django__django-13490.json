    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `get()` method is used with a filter that uniquely identifies a single object and provides a workaround by converting the QuerySet to a list or using `first()`. However, this does not align with the git diff, which introduces a specific error check and raises a `NotSupportedError` when `get()` is called with filters after a combinator like `difference()`. The RESPONSE fails to address the core issue of raising a descriptive error when `get()` is used with filters after `union()`, `intersection()`, or `difference()`. The RESPONSE does not provide a solution that would prevent the incorrect usage of `get()` after these operations, which is the main focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with `get()` after `difference()` but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
