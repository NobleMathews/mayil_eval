    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `slugify` function to handle the Turkish/Azerbaijani letter '\u0130' correctly, which is aligned with the issue description. It correctly identifies that the string should be converted to lowercase before applying the regular expression, which is also what the git diff does by moving the `.lower()` call before the `re.sub()` call. The RESPONSE also suggests using `unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', value).casefold()` for case-insensitive comparison and conversion to lowercase, which is not present in the git diff but is a valid alternative approach to handling Unicode case folding. The RESPONSE further suggests updating the regular expression to allow Unicode letters if `allow_unicode` is True, which is not directly related to the git diff but is a reasonable suggestion for handling Unicode characters in slugs. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but provides a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to ensure that the Turkish/Azerbaijani letter '\u0130' is correctly converted to 'i' in the slug. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, although it does not directly replicate the git diff's solution.",
