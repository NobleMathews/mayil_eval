{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution to the issue of tracking the refit time of the best model in the `BaseSearchCV` class after a grid or random search. It correctly suggests adding a new attribute `refit_time_` to store the refit time and measuring the time before and after the `fit` method is called on the best estimator. The RESPONSE also includes the necessary code snippet to implement the feature and advises updating the class docstring to document the new attribute, which aligns with the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes an additional clone operation in the `set_params` method call, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the core solution of measuring and storing the refit time is correctly addressed. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to import the `time` module, which is in line with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is comprehensive and provides actionable guidance that would enable a developer to implement the requested feature effectively. It also includes a reference to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which is helpful but not necessary for the solution. The RESPONSE is scored a 9 because it offers a highly relevant solution that closely aligns with the git diff, with only minor differences that do not impact the effectiveness of the solution.",
