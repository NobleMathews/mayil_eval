{
    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with `sympy.pycode` not generating `math.sqrt` for `sqrt(x)` expressions and suggests modifying the `_hprint_Pow` method in `sympy/printing/pycode.py` to handle the `sqrt` function similarly to other functions. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the `_hprint_Pow` method to handle the `sqrt` function correctly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made. The git diff includes a more comprehensive update to the `PythonCodePrinter` class and related classes, addressing the issue with `sqrt` and other related issues. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `_hprint_Pow` method is somewhat relevant but lacks the full context and details provided in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a large section of code snippets to check, which are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. This part of the RESPONSE does not add value in terms of fixing the issue and could potentially distract from the actual changes needed.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant, warranting a score of 3.",
