    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the numpy-style docstring formatting, updating the pylint configuration, and potentially upgrading pylint or reporting the issue to the development team. While these are general good practices, the RESPONSE fails to address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the regex pattern in the `_check_docs_utils.py` file to correctly handle numpy-style parameter documentation without type specifications. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable advice related to the code changes needed to fix the issue. It only partially aligns with the issue description by acknowledging the problem with numpy-style docstrings but does not offer a solution that would resolve the false positive warnings. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that matches the git diff.",
