    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the errors reported in the issue, suggesting that there might be a logic error in the handling of the queue and a problem with comparison in the priority queue. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff, which specifically addresses the TypeError by ensuring that no None values are compared by introducing a new function `node_line_or_0` to handle potential None values from `get_node_line`. The RESPONSE does not mention this solution or anything similar to it. Instead, it suggests reviewing the `check_thread` method and ensuring that `task_done()` is called correctly, which is not directly related to the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the `HyperlinkAvailabilityChecker` class, which is not addressed in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the errors seen in the issue, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
