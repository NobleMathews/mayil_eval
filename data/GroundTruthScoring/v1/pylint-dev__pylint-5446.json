    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general approach to understanding and potentially modifying the `Similar` checker class to respect `#pylint:enable` and `#pylint:disable` comments. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a concrete implementation where the checker is modified to filter out lines that should be ignored due to disables, using the `_is_one_message_enabled` method. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, speaks about modifying the `__init__` method and other relevant methods, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding tests, which is a good practice but is not part of the git diff provided. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of enabling/disabling the duplicate code check, but it lacks the actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
