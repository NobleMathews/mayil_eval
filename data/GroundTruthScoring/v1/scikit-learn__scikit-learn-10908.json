    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `get_feature_names` method and the `_check_vocabulary` method to prevent raising a `NotFittedError` when a vocabulary is provided. This aligns with the git diff's intention of ensuring that `get_feature_names` does not raise an error when the vocabulary is provided. However, the RESPONSE suggests updating `_check_vocabulary` and `get_feature_names_out`, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff directly adds a check for the `vocabulary_` attribute and calls `_validate_vocabulary` within the `get_feature_names` method. The RESPONSE does not mention adding a check for the `vocabulary_` attribute within `get_feature_names` nor does it suggest calling `_validate_vocabulary`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not directly related to the git diff's changes and provides a link to the codebase, which is not necessary for fixing the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the specific changes shown in the git diff.",
