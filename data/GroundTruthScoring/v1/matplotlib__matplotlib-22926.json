    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows that the solution involves importing the Polygon class, using a different transform for the slider polygon, and updating the vertices of the slider polygon with a new method _update_selection_poly. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying the set_val method to handle tuples with identical values and incorrectly assumes that the issue is with the initialization of valinit as a tuple with identical values. The RESPONSE also includes incorrect code suggestions that do not match the git diff, such as handling the val parameter as a tuple and updating the polygon's vertices directly in the set_val method. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not provide value in the context of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any insights or actionable guidance that would assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
