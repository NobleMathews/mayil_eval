    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding validation logic to the `mktemp` function to disallow absolute and non-normalized paths, which aligns with the intent of the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff modifies the `TempPathFactory.mktemp` and `TempdirFactory.mktemp` methods in the `tmpdir.py` file, while the RESPONSE suggests modifying a generic `mktemp` function and implementing a new `is_normalized_relative_path` function. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references a `dir` parameter, which does not exist in the context of the ISSUE or the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets in a repository that are not related to the actual codebase in question. The RESPONSE does not provide a correct or effective alternative to the git diff and includes extraneous and potentially misleading information.",
