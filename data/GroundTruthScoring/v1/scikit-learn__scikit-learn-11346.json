    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `dictionary` array is writable and checking for any parts of the code that might be setting it to read-only. However, the git diff indicates that the issue is not with the `dictionary` array but with the `Xy` array. The git diff shows that the solution involves making a copy of the `Xy` array if it is not writable before it is passed to parallel jobs in the `_gram_omp` and `orthogonal_mp_gram` functions. The RESPONSE does not address the `Xy` array at all and instead incorrectly focuses on the `dictionary` array, which is not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not relevant to the actual changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
