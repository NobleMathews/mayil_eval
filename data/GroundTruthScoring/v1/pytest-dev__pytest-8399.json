    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests checking for changes in pytest's handling of unittest compatibility and ensuring proper fixture documentation and naming conventions, which are general good practices but do not address the specific issue of the fixture names not starting with an underscore. The git diff shows that the fix involves adding an underscore to the beginning of the fixture names in the source code, which the RESPONSE fails to mention. The RESPONSE does touch on the need for fixtures to start with an underscore, but it does not provide a clear direction on how to implement this change in the codebase, which is the core of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
