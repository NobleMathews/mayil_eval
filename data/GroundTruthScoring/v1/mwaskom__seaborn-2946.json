    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `custom_min` function returns a scalar value and modifying it to handle pandas Series correctly. While this is somewhat relevant, it does not address the core issue that the seaborn library's handling of custom estimators has changed. The RESPONSE fails to recognize that the issue is with seaborn's internal `EstimateAggregator` class, which the git diff modifies to handle callable estimators correctly. The RESPONSE does suggest checking for changes in the `EstimateAggregator` class, but it does not provide actionable guidance on how to fix the issue. The code snippets provided are relevant to the issue, but the RESPONSE does not offer any direct solution or modification to the seaborn codebase, unlike the git diff, which provides a specific fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff.",
