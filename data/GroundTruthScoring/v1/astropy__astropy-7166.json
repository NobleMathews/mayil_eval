{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass to handle properties by using `inspect.isdatadescriptor` instead of `inspect.isfunction`. The RESPONSE also provides a detailed code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the necessary changes in the metaclass, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE's code snippet checks for both functions and data descriptors, which is a more comprehensive solution than the git diff, which only adds the check for data descriptors. The RESPONSE also includes links to relevant code snippets in the repository, which could help the developer understand the context better. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not exactly match the git diff, as it provides a more general solution that covers both functions and data descriptors.",
