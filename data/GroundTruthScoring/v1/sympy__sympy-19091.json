{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general strategy for addressing the issue with tensor contractions in the SymPy library, suggesting that the metric application code should be moved before the tensor contraction code in the `_extract_data` method. This aligns with the git diff, which also reorders operations to ensure the metric is applied before contraction. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or mention the introduction of the new `_contract_and_permute_with_metric` method, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_TensorDataLazyEvaluator.data_contract_dum` method, which is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not mention the removal of the `contract_and_permute` function, which is part of the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in terms of the overall goal but lacks the specificity and exact changes made in the git diff. Therefore, it offers actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant, warranting a score of 4.",
