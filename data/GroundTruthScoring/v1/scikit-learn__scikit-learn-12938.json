    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is caused by the missing `_indent_at_name` attribute in the `PrettyPrinter` class and recommends either initializing this attribute in the `CustomPrettyPrinter` class or updating the `_pprint_estimator` function to handle its absence. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix involved copying the `_dispatch` dictionary from the `pprint.PrettyPrinter` class to prevent instances of the built-in `PrettyPrinter` class from calling methods of `_EstimatorPrettyPrinter`. The RESPONSE does not mention or address the `_dispatch` dictionary or the copying of it, which is the core of the solution in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described. The score of 2 is given because the RESPONSE does recognize that there is an issue with the `PrettyPrinter` class and suggests looking into the `sklearn.utils._pprint` module, which is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
