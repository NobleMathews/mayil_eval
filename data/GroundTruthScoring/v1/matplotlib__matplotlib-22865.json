    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general approach to debugging the issue with the colorbar edges not being drawn at extremities when `drawedges=True` and `extend='both'`. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the indexing of the segments to be drawn when `drawedges` is enabled, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does correctly identify that the issue is related to the drawing of colorbar edges and mentions checking the `_extend_lower()` and `_extend_upper()` methods, which are indeed part of the solution in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the correct actionable steps or code modifications needed to resolve the issue. It also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
