    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `replace_named_groups` function to handle regex patterns without a trailing '/'. The RESPONSE suggests updating the function to account for the end of the string as a valid termination point for a named group, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adjusting the logic to correctly append the group name and break the loop when the brackets are balanced. The RESPONSE also recommends testing the updated function with and without a trailing '/', which is a good practice to ensure the fix works as intended. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes shown in the git diff, such as the specific adjustments to the loop and the indices used to append the group name. Instead, it suggests a regex pattern change, which is not present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and would likely lead to a successful resolution of the issue, it does not match the git diff precisely and is scored a 7.",
