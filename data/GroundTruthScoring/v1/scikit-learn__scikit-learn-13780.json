    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the feature request to handle 'drop' together with 'None' for dropping an estimator in `VotingClassifier` and `VotingRegressor`. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_validate_estimators` method and the `fit` method in both classes, as well as the `set_params` method. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet demonstrating the proposed changes to the `fit` method, which is in line with the git diff's approach to handling 'drop' and 'None'. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the documentation and adding unit tests, which are good practices but not directly reflected in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to error handling when an estimator does not support sample weights, which is a significant part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not fully aligned with the git diff, but it does provide a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
