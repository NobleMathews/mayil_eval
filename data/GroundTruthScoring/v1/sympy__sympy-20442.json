    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It offers a general review of the `convert_to` function and related code without addressing the specific issue of handling unit conversions as described in the issue. The RESPONSE suggests checking various parts of the code and testing with compound units, but it does not mention the specific change made in the git diff, which involves handling a `NonInvertibleMatrixError` and returning `None` when the matrix cannot be inverted. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the area of the code that needs attention but fails to provide specific, actionable steps to resolve the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
