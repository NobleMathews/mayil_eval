    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the LaTeX printer not printing parentheses correctly for matrix products involving negative symbols. The suggested modifications to the `_print_MatMul` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` are in line with the changes made in the git diff, specifically the handling of negative coefficients in matrix multiplication and the use of the `_coeff_isneg` function to determine if the coefficient is negative.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It suggests modifying the `_print_MatMul` method to ensure parentheses are added around negative matrix symbols, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to the `_print_MatMul` and `_coeff_isneg` functions.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the `_print_MatAdd` method and the changes to the `precedence.py` file, which are also part of the git diff. While these changes are not directly related to the issue of printing parentheses, they are part of the overall solution in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not fully comprehensive in addressing all the changes in the git diff, which leads to a score of 8 instead of a perfect 10.",
