    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the function signature to include a new parameter, adding logic for padding, updating the docstring, and writing tests. However, it suggests adding a 'bits' parameter, which is not aligned with the git diff that introduces a 'digits' parameter instead. The RESPONSE's code snippet and test cases are based on the 'bits' parameter, which is a deviation from the git diff's solution. While the RESPONSE's approach could be a valid alternative, it does not match the git diff's approach of adding a 'digits' parameter and the associated logic for padding with zeros. The RESPONSE also includes a detailed explanation and code examples, which are helpful, but the core suggestion does not align with the git diff's solution.",
