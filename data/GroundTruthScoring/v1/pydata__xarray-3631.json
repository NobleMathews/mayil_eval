    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results. It suggests modifying the `datetime_to_numeric` function in `xarray/coding/times.py`, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff shows changes in `xarray/coding/cftimeindex.py`, `xarray/core/dataarray.py`, `xarray/core/dataset.py`, `xarray/core/duck_array_ops.py`, and `xarray/core/missing.py`, but the RESPONSE does not address these files or the specific changes made in them.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking the usage of `datetime.timedelta` in `xarray/coding/cftimeindex.py` and `xarray/core/missing.py`, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff, but it does not provide specific, actionable advice on what changes to make. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff or the solution to the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to offer any insights or actionable guidance that would assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.",
