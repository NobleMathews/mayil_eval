    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifications to the `latex` function and potentially the `_print_Div` method in the `LatexPrinter` class, as well as changes to the `pprint` function in the `pretty` module. However, the git diff provided does not show any changes to these methods or classes. Instead, the git diff shows a change in the `_needs_mul_brackets` method, specifically adding a condition for `expr.is_Piecewise` and modifying the list of expressions that trigger the need for multiplication brackets. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of inconsistent printing between the LaTeX and pretty printers in the context of the `Piecewise` function or the removal of `Piecewise` from the list of expressions in the last condition. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the LaTeX printing issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
