    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to update the `check_user_model` function to address the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to modify the condition that checks for uniqueness to include a check for `UniqueConstraint` objects in `cls._meta.constraints` that specify the `USERNAME_FIELD`. This aligns closely with the git diff, which adds a similar check for `total_unique_constraints` instead of `constraints`. The RESPONSE also correctly maintains the existing condition that the check should only be performed if the `ModelBackend` is used.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it refers to `cls._meta.constraints` instead of `cls._meta.total_unique_constraints`. However, this difference does not significantly impact the effectiveness of the solution, as both approaches aim to check for the presence of a unique constraint on the `USERNAME_FIELD`. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by linking to relevant code snippets in the Django repository, which could be helpful for the developer.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff, with a minor difference in the attribute used to check for unique constraints. This minor difference does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
