    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating links from underscores to dashes to reflect the change in anchor generation, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue is being addressed by modifying the `make_id` function to revert the anchor generation behavior to use underscores instead of dashes, and by updating the `add_target_and_index` method to use the modified `make_id` function. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes needed to fix the issue and instead suggests a workaround that would not resolve the underlying problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the `nbsphinx` documentation and repository for updates, which is unrelated to the code changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
