    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating the dpi attribute during the pickling and unpickling process, which is relevant to the issue. It also recommends setting the dpi attribute to its original value after unpickling, which aligns with the git diff's approach of ensuring the dpi is not changed due to pixel ratio changes. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution like the git diff does, which adds a line to set the dpi to the original value or the current value if the original is not set. Instead, it suggests a more general approach without concrete implementation details.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests switching backends as a workaround, which is not related to the git diff's solution and does not address the root cause of the issue. This part of the RESPONSE is not actionable in terms of fixing the bug in the current backend.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not directly guide the developer to the exact location of the fix, unlike the git diff which pinpoints the exact file and lines to be modified. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
