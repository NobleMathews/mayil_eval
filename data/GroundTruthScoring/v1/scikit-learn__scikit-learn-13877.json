{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable suggestions that are relevant to the issue of incorrect results when using `pairwise_distances` with the `cosine` metric and parallel computation. It correctly identifies the need to investigate the handling of the `n_jobs` parameter and the data type of the output matrix, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a dtype variable and the use of this variable when creating the `ret` matrix.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific addition of `_return_float_dtype(X, Y)` function call, which is a key part of the git diff's solution to ensure the correct data type is used. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests verifying the `np.fill_diagonal(ret, 0)` call and considering an explicit cast to `float`, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead adds a condition to zero the diagonal for the euclidean norm, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests reviewing recent changes and adding version checks, which are not part of the git diff and do not directly address the issue described. While these are good general practices, they do not provide a solution to the specific problem at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks key elements of the solution and includes additional suggestions that are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
