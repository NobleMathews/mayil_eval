    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `__copy__` method to return an instance of `HDUList` instead of a list, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE's alternative of using `return HDUList(self)` instead of `return self[:]` is a valid and effective way to ensure that a shallow copy of the `HDUList` is returned, which aligns with the intent of the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `HDUList` constructor should be able to handle another `HDUList` instance, which is implicit in the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `__deepcopy__` method, which is included in the git diff, but this omission does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE in fixing the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and for providing clear, actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
