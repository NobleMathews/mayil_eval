    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to achieve the same result.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the DjangoHelpFormatter class and its add_arguments method to reorder the management command arguments. However, the git diff provided shows that the solution implemented was to move the call to self.add_arguments(parser) before the common arguments are added to the parser in the create_parser method of the same file. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach and does not provide a code change that would directly resolve the issue as the git diff does. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of reordering arguments, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff, and it does not mention any changes to the create_parser method, which is key to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
