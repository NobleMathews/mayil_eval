    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of `refine()` not simplifying complex arguments.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing an `_eval_refine` method for the `Integral` class and the `arg` function, as well as ensuring that `refine()` and its handlers correctly use the `ask()` function and that `Piecewise` expressions are handled properly. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution involved adding a new function `refine_arg` to handle the complex argument case, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of extending the `refine.py` module with a specific handler for the `arg` function. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to check the `Integral` and `Piecewise` classes is not directly related to the git diff, which focuses solely on the `arg` function. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of `refine()` not simplifying expressions based on assumptions, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's solution.",
