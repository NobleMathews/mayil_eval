{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ProtectedError` and `RestrictedError` exception classes to provide a more informative `__repr__` method. While this could potentially improve the readability of the exceptions in Sentry logs, it does not address the core issue described, which is that the exceptions contain iterators, making the repr not informative. The git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves converting the iterators to sets before they are passed to the exceptions. The RESPONSE does not mention this critical change and instead focuses on modifying the `__repr__` methods of the exceptions, which is not the solution shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it aims to improve the readability of the exceptions, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or effectively resolves the issue. The score of 2 reflects that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
