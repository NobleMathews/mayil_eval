{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_get_explicit_or_implicit_cause` function to respect the `__suppress_context__` attribute, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE's code snippet is correct and effectively addresses the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes references to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which is helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not include the additional changes made in the git diff, such as refactoring the `get_traceback_frames` function and introducing the `get_exception_traceback_frames` function. However, the RESPONSE's suggested change is a critical part of the solution and would significantly contribute to resolving the issue.",
