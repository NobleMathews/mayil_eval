    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `fit` method to support warm starting, which aligns with the git diff's changes to the `fit` method. It correctly identifies the need to check if `warm_start` is `True` and if the model has been previously fitted, and to continue training from the last iteration. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the preservation of the random state (`_rng`) or the handling of the training and validation split seed (`_train_val_split_seed`), which are crucial for the warm start feature and are included in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes to the constructor to include the `warm_start` parameter, nor does it mention the need to update the documentation to reflect the new feature, both of which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is too generic and does not reflect the detailed changes made in the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE suggests looking into the joblib library for parallelization, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. Overall, the RESPONSE provides a starting point for implementing warm starting but lacks the depth and specificity of the git diff.",
