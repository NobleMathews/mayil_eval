    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with feature importances not summing to 1 in ensemble tree methods. It suggests normalizing feature importances for each tree and then averaging them across all trees, which is a valid approach and aligns with the git diff's intent to ensure feature importances are correctly calculated. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific changes made in the git diff, such as filtering out single-node trees and using np.mean to calculate the average feature importances before normalization. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes suggestions to update libraries and report the issue if it persists, which are not directly related to the code changes required to fix the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but lacks the specificity and completeness of the git diff.",
