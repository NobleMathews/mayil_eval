    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE. The issue is related to a crash in pylint when parsing a Python file with a specific comment that disables a pylint check. The RESPONSE suggests removing the comment or ensuring proper indentation, which is not relevant to the actual problem of pylint crashing due to the handling of disabled messages. The RESPONSE also suggests removing the `--ignore-imports=y` flag, which is part of the problem, but does not provide a solution to the underlying issue in the pylint codebase.\n\nThe git diff provided shows changes to the pylint codebase that handle the disabled messages in a different way, by adding a callback to check if a message is enabled for a specific line. The RESPONSE does not align with this approach and does not offer any alternative solution that would prevent pylint from crashing. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue.",
