    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `LANGUAGES` setting in `settings.py` to include the sublanguage 'de-at' or ensure that the base language 'de' is included. This advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it pertains to language settings in Django. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `check_language_settings_consistent` function to use `get_supported_language_variant` for checking the `LANGUAGE_CODE` against available languages, rather than manually updating the `LANGUAGES` setting.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but it does not offer any actionable guidance on how to modify the code to fix the issue, as shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the topic of language settings, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue or offer a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
