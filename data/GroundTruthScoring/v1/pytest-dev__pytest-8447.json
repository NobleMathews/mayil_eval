    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `from_parent` method calls in `pytest_black.py` and `pytest_checkdocs/__init__.py` to match the signature of the `__init__` method of the `BlackItem` and `CheckdocsItem` classes, and replacing the `path` keyword argument with `fspath`. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, which involves a `TypeError` due to an unexpected keyword argument 'path', the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem.\n\nThe git diff shows that the actual solution involves modifying the `FSCollector` class's `__init__` method to accept a new parameter `path_or_parent` and handle it appropriately, as well as adding a warning mechanism in the `_create` method of the `NodeMeta` class to handle unexpected keyword arguments. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes and instead focuses on the `from_parent` method and the `BlackItem` and `CheckdocsItem` classes, which are not directly addressed in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides an example fix that does not correspond to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE's example fix suggests using `super().__new__` instead of `super().__call__` or `super().__init__`, which is not in line with the git diff or standard Python class instantiation practices.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section titled \"Code snippets to check\" with links to lines in a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. This section is not actionable and does not provide any guidance related to the git diff or the issue at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice regarding the handling of keyword arguments but fails to offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
