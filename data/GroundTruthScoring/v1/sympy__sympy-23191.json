    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with the `pretty_print` function in the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. However, the RESPONSE does not offer specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests reviewing and adjusting the pretty printing logic without pinpointing the exact changes needed. The git diff, on the other hand, provides specific changes to the handling of right parenthesis extensions and hooks within the `_print_BasisDependent` method, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may not be directly related to the issue, such as the vector operations and point modules, which do not appear in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, thus it receives a score of 2.",
