    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to add support for a precision argument to Django's `Round` function, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the `Round` class to accept an additional argument for precision and updating the `as_sql` method for each database backend to include the precision argument in the SQL function call. This aligns with the git diff's intent to add support for precision in the `Round` function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in several ways:\n\n1. The RESPONSE suggests overriding the `as_sql` method for each database backend, while the git diff specifically provides an `as_sqlite` method with a check for negative precision and raises a `ValueError` if it is encountered. The RESPONSE does not mention this check.\n\n2. The RESPONSE suggests using `arity = 2` in the `Round` class, but the git diff does not include this change. Instead, the git diff sets `arity = None` and overrides the `__init__` method to accept `precision` as an argument.\n\n3. The RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `django_test_skips` dictionary in the `features.py` file, which are present in the git diff to handle test skips for SQLite when negative precision is used.\n\n4. The RESPONSE suggests registering the `Round` function with `@Func.register_lookup`, which is not present in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach but lacks key elements present in the git diff, such as the specific handling of negative precision for SQLite and the test skips. Therefore, it is scored as partially relevant and actionable.",
