    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the Knuth-Cohen bound for both univariate and multivariate polynomials, which is relevant to the issue. It suggests creating new functions for the Knuth-Cohen bound and replacing the calls to the existing Mignotte bound functions with these new functions. This approach is aligned with the git diff's intent to replace the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound in the `factortools.py` module.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the actual implementation details or the correct mathematical formula for the Knuth-Cohen bound, which are crucial for resolving the issue. The git diff, on the other hand, includes a detailed implementation of the Knuth-Cohen bound for univariate polynomials, complete with examples, references, and a specific algorithm that includes the calculation of the euclidean-norm and binomial coefficients. The RESPONSE's suggestion to look up the specific formula is not helpful since the git diff already provides the necessary implementation.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE does not mention any changes to the multivariate case (`dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`), which is part of the issue description. The git diff only shows changes to the univariate case, but the issue clearly states that the multivariate case should also be replaced appropriately.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice and is somewhat relevant to the issue, but it is incomplete and lacks the specific details present in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4.",
