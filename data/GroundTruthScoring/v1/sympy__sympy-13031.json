    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to review the `Matrix.hstack` implementation and ensure that `Matrix.zeros` initializes zero matrices correctly. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the `hstack` method to restore the expected behavior for zero-row matrices and suggests adding test cases, which is valuable. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff modifies the `col_join` and `row_join` methods in `sparse.py` to handle the case when a null matrix is stacked, whereas the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `hstack` method directly and checking for zero-row matrices before reducing with `kls.row_join`. The RESPONSE's solution is a valid alternative approach to the issue, but it does not match the git diff's specific changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code but does not directly contribute to solving the issue.",
