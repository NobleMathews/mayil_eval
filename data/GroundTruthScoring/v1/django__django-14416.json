    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue of incorrect language display due to inappropriate caching by HTTP caches. It correctly identifies the need to add the 'Vary' header based on the 'Accept-Language' and 'Cookie' headers, which is in line with the git diff that patches the 'Accept-Language' header into the response.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by suggesting the inclusion of `settings.LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME` in the `Vary` header, which is a valid consideration given that the language can also be determined by a cookie. However, the git diff does not explicitly mention `settings.LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME`, instead, it uses 'Cookie' as a general term. This difference does not detract from the RESPONSE's utility, as it still addresses the core issue.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides broader advice on ensuring that the caching layer respects the 'Vary' header and on the correct configuration of `CacheMiddleware` to work with `LocaleMiddleware`. While these suggestions are not directly reflected in the git diff, they are relevant to the overall issue of caching and language handling.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises reviewing and possibly adjusting the `learn_cache_key` function, which is not mentioned in the git diff but is a reasonable step to ensure that caching behavior aligns with the changes made to the `Vary` header handling.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. It provides actionable advice that would help in resolving the issue, although it includes additional suggestions that are not present in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
