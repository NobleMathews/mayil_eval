    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE. The git diff shows changes to the 'reduce', 'argmin', and 'argmax' methods in the 'dataset.py' file, including the removal of the 'axis' parameter and the addition of a ValueError when 'axis' is passed to the 'reduce' method. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifications to various methods and files, including '_aggregations.py', 'duck_array_ops.py', and 'coordinates.py', which are not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance related to the changes shown in the git diff, such as removing the 'axis' parameter or handling the 'axis' argument in the 'reduce' method. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff and fails to assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
