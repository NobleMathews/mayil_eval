    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue of converting the max_age parameter to an integer in the set_cookie() method. It suggests adding a type check for max_age and converting it to an integer if it is a float without a decimal part, or raising a ValueError if it cannot be converted. This aligns well with the git diff, which also converts max_age to an integer. However, the RESPONSE goes further by adding additional checks and raising an exception if the conversion is not possible, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff simply converts max_age to an integer without additional checks or error handling. The RESPONSE also provides relevant code snippets and links to other parts of the Django codebase that may provide insight into handling integers and floats, which could be useful for the developer. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but offers a viable alternative approach to the issue, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
