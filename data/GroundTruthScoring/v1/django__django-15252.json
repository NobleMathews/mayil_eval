    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` method to check if migrations are allowed for the given database using the router's `allow_migrate` method before attempting to create the migration table. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it addresses the concern of obeying db_router allow_migrate rules. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which does not modify the `ensure_schema` method but instead adds a conditional check in the `migrate` method to prevent the creation of the migration table if there are no migrations to apply.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff suggests a solution that avoids creating the migration table if the plan is empty, which is a different approach than modifying the `ensure_schema` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE assumes that the `app_label` for the migrations app is 'migrations', which is not a detail provided in the git diff or the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and does not provide clear, actionable steps that would enable the developer to fix the issue as per the git diff. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability in the context of the git diff.",
