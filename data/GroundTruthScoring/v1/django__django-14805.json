    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan to address the issue of adding output to the `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands when the `--noinput` flag is used. It aligns well with the git diff by suggesting modifications to the `NonInteractiveMigrationQuestioner` class and the management commands to output warnings when input is required but not provided. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to log messages to `stderr` and to exit with a non-zero status code when necessary, which is in line with the git diff's approach to handling non-interactive scenarios.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. For example, the RESPONSE suggests adding a new method `log_input_required` and overriding methods in the `NonInteractiveMigrationQuestioner` class, while the git diff adds a `log_lack_of_migration` method and directly modifies the existing methods. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of `verbosity` and `log` parameters to the `NonInteractiveMigrationQuestioner` constructor, which are present in the git diff.\n\nDespite these differences, the RESPONSE's approach is effective and relevant, and it would achieve the desired outcome of providing output when migrations fail due to required input. Therefore, it receives a score of 7 for its high relevance and actionable guidance.",
