    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and suggests a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies that the `split_super_sub` function in `sympy.printing.conventions` needs to handle empty strings and suggests modifying it to return `('', [], [])` when an empty string is passed, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides further guidance on checking the `translate` function and the `pretty_symbol` function for proper handling of empty strings, which is relevant to the traceback provided in the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests checking additional functions that are not modified in the git diff, but these suggestions are still relevant and could prevent similar issues. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly valuable and actionable, warranting a score of 9.",
