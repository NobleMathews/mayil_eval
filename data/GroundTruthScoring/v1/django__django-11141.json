    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the check for the `__file__` attribute, which aligns with the git diff that removes the check for `getattr(module, '__file__', None)`. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises modifying the `pkgutil.iter_modules()` usage to ensure it works with namespace packages, which is also in line with the git diff that adjusts the handling of migration names and the addition of app labels to `self.migrated_apps` or `self.unmigrated_apps` based on the presence of migration names or the `ignore_no_migrations` flag.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it does provide a viable alternative approach to the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check if `module.__path__` is a list is a reasonable way to support namespace packages, although this specific check is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead focuses on the presence of migration names to determine if an app should be added to `self.migrated_apps` or `self.unmigrated_apps`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes references to specific code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for a developer looking to understand the context of the changes. However, it does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of the `self.migrated_apps.add(app_config.label)` line outside of the conditional block and its inclusion within the new conditional block.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is relevant and closely matches the git diff, but it does not capture all the nuances of the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
