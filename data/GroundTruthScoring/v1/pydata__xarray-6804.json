    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of steps to implement PyTorch as a backend for xarrays, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows modifications to existing files to support the array API, which is a step towards enabling PyTorch as a backend, as PyTorch supports the array API. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests creating a new backend and data store for PyTorch, which is a different approach and does not reflect the changes made in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE, it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's modifications and does not provide guidance on modifying existing functions to support the array API. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
