    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps, such as updating the `Line3D` class to ensure it has the `_verts3d` attribute, checking for compatibility with Matplotlib version 3.5.0, verifying backend support, adding a mechanism to reset the state, ensuring numpy arrays are correctly shaped, and isolating the plotting code. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a line to convert the `zs` variable to an unmasked float array and ensure it is the correct shape. The RESPONSE fails to mention this specific solution or provide a similar alternative. It does, however, correctly identify that the issue is related to the handling of 3D vertices, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0. The provided code snippets are not directly relevant to the fix shown in the git diff.",
