{
    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately instructs the developer to locate the `xarray/core/merge.py` file and specifically identifies line 504, which is the exact line that needs to be modified according to the git diff. The suggested change in the RESPONSE, 'Replace the line `return variable_attrs[0]` with `return dict(variable_attrs[0])`', matches the git diff perfectly. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a clear explanation for why this change is necessary, which is to ensure that a copy of the attributes dictionary is returned, making it independent of the source. This explanation aligns with the issue description, which states that the current behavior results in a reference to the attrs from the first object, rather than a copy. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code snippet, which is helpful for the developer to verify the context of the change. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offers clear guidance, and aligns closely with the git diff, making it deserving of a score of 10.",
