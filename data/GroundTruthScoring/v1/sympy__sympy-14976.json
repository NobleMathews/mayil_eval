    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to precision loss in `lambdify` when using `mpmath` for rational numbers, which is correct. However, the solution provided in the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff. The git diff adds a new `_print_Rational` method to the `MpmathPrinter` class that formats rationals using `mpmath.mpf` for both the numerator and the denominator, without altering the precision settings. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying the `_print_Rational` method to temporarily change the global precision setting of `mpmath` using `mp.dps`, which is a different approach and could have side effects on other parts of the code that rely on the global precision setting. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets and mentions ensuring that the precision setting is correctly passed to the `MpmathPrinter`, which is not addressed in the git diff and is not necessary for the specific issue at hand. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the precision issue, but it does not provide a solution that closely matches the git diff or achieves the same result without potential side effects. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
