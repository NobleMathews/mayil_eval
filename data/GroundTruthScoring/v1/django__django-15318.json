    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows changes to the 'related_descriptors.py' file in Django, adding checks to ensure that an instance has a primary key before using its relationships and adding a method '_check_fk_val' to validate foreign key values before certain operations. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying the 'Foo' model's 'save' method and ensuring instances are saved before accessing relationships, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also references a '#17541 patch' and provides a link to code snippets that are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and does not provide actionable guidance that would help resolve the issue as described. The score of 1 is given because the RESPONSE does mention the need for an instance to have a primary key before accessing relationships, which is a minor point of alignment with the git diff, but overall, the RESPONSE is not helpful in fixing the issue.",
