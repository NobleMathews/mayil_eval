{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 4 indicates that the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a cache clearing method call in the `_unregister_instance_lookup` method, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff shows that the change should be made in the `_unregister_lookup` method, not `_unregister_instance_lookup`. However, the RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to clear the cache, which aligns with the git diff's addition of `cls._clear_cached_lookups()` in the `_unregister_lookup` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests updating the test `test_func_unique_constraint_lookups` to verify that the cache is cleared, which is not mentioned in the git diff but is a reasonable suggestion that could be part of a complete solution to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a link to the code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code, but it incorrectly refers to the method to be changed and does not match the git diff's specific change.",
