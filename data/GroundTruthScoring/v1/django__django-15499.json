{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable plan for optimizing the migration operations by combining CreateModel and AlterModelManagers into a single CreateModel operation, which is exactly what the git diff demonstrates. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `optimize_migration_operations` function to detect and combine these operations, updating the `CreateModel` class to accept managers, and ensuring the `state_forwards` method applies the managers. It also correctly identifies the removal of the redundant `AlterModelManagers` operation after the combination.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns closely with the git diff, which adds a new condition to the `reduce` method to handle the case where a CreateModel operation is followed by an AlterModelManagers operation for the same model. The git diff shows the implementation of this logic, which the RESPONSE effectively describes without providing the exact code changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's code but offers a high-level description of the changes needed, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, it provides a clear, actionable plan that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff, making it highly valuable for a developer looking to resolve the issue.",
