{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `URLValidator` class to catch the `ValueError` and raise a `ValidationError` instead, which is the main issue described. The RESPONSE also includes an example modification that is very similar to the changes in the git diff, including the try-except block around the `urlsplit` call and the raising of a `ValidationError` if a `ValueError` is caught.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the additional checks for the hostname length and the IPv6 address validation that are present in the git diff, but it does suggest ensuring that the `clean_ipv6_address` function is used appropriately, which indirectly addresses the IPv6 validation part of the issue. The RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue. It does not match the git diff exactly in terms of the additional checks, but it achieves a similar result and is therefore scored a 9.",
