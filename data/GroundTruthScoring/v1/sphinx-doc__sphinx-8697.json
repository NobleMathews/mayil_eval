    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file (`sphinx/environment/__init__.py`) and function (`relfn2path`) where the issue originates, which aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `relfn2path` function to ensure paths are normalized, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `os.path.normcase` in addition to `os.path.normpath`, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff uses `posixpath.normpath` and `path.normpath` without introducing `os.path.normcase`. The RESPONSE does not mention the removal of `path.abspath`, which is a key change in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that does not match the git diff and provides links to other parts of the codebase that are not directly related to the fix. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff and includes suggestions that are not supported by the git diff.",
