    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting an update to the `re_path` in `urls.py` and a modification to the `modules` view function in `views.py`. This advice is relevant to the issue of optional URL parameters causing crashes in view functions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows a change in the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file, where the kwargs are now being filtered after all groupdict items are assigned to kwargs, ensuring that only non-None values are passed to the view functions. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the URL pattern and the view function does not address the underlying issue in the URL resolver logic that the git diff aims to fix. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a workaround, it does not match the git diff's solution and is incomplete in addressing the core problem. Hence, a score of 4 is appropriate.",
