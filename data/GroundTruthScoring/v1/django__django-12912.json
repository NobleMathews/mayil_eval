    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps for resolving the issue with the incorrect SQL generation for the `Min` aggregate function with a filter. However, it does not provide a specific solution or directly address the problem in the code as shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by changing the equality comparison from '==' to 'is' in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. The RESPONSE does not mention this change or provide an alternative solution that would lead to the same outcome.\n\nThe RESPONSE does offer some relevant suggestions, such as ensuring correct field references and conditions, reviewing the `aggregate` function call, and comparing SQL generation logic between Django versions. It also suggests looking at specific code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer. However, these suggestions are not actionable in the context of the git diff provided, and they do not directly lead to the resolution of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to provide a specific and actionable solution that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. Therefore, it receives a low score for not effectively addressing the issue as presented in the git diff.",
