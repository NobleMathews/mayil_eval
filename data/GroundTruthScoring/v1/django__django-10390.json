    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `make_aware` function in `django/utils/timezone.py` and updating the `from_current_timezone` function in `django/forms/utils.py` to handle the `is_dst` flag. It also recommends ensuring that the `is_dst` flag is set appropriately during DST transitions and updating the `Trunc` class to handle DST transitions using the updated `make_aware` function with the `is_dst` flag. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to `django/utils/timezone.py` or `django/forms/utils.py`. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to the `TruncBase` and `Trunc` classes in `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` to include an `is_dst` parameter in their constructors and to use this parameter when calling `timezone.make_aware`. The RESPONSE does align with the git diff in suggesting an update to the `Trunc` class to handle the `is_dst` flag, but it fails to provide specific, actionable guidance that matches the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer, but it does not directly address the changes needed as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
