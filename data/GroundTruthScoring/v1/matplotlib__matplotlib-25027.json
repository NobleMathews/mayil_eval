    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes required to fix the issue. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_pcolorargs' method and the 'PcolorImage' class, which are not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces concepts such as 'blender_rgbAAA' and 'blender_bgrAAA' from 'agg_pixfmt_rgb_packed.h', which are not part of the actual solution in the git diff.\n\nThe git diff shows extensive changes to the 'axes/_axes.py' and 'collections.py' files, including modifications to handle masked arrays and updates to the 'PolyQuadMesh' and 'QuadMesh' classes. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide an alternative approach that would lead to the same outcome.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not reflective of the changes in the git diff and does not contribute to resolving the issue described. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
