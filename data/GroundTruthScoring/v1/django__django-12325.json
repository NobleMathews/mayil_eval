    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests swapping the order of the field declarations in the `Picking` class to resolve the `ImproperlyConfigured` error. However, this suggestion does not align with the git diff provided, which instead modifies the Django source code to handle OneToOneField instances with a parent_link more accurately and removes the ImproperlyConfigured exception that was being raised.\n\nThe git diff makes changes to the `base.py` file to ensure that only OneToOneField instances with a parent_link are considered as parent links, and it modifies the `options.py` file to remove the check that raises the ImproperlyConfigured exception. The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead offers a workaround that is not supported by the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the solution provided in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a valid alternative solution.",
