    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests replacing the current implementation of the `fowlkes_mallows_score` function to avoid integer overflow, which aligns with the git diff's approach to changing the calculation method to prevent overflow errors. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that `pk`, `qk`, and `tk` are computed as floating-point numbers, which is in line with the git diff's addition of `.astype(np.int64)` to the contingency matrix calculation. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `np.float64` instead of `np.int64`, which is a slight deviation from the git diff but still addresses the overflow issue effectively. The RESPONSE also provides a corrected code snippet that closely matches the git diff's changes, including the updated return statement. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact data type used (`np.float64` vs. `np.int64`), but it achieves the same result of preventing overflow and is therefore a valid alternative approach. The RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 because it does not exactly match the git diff's data type choice, but it is still a highly effective solution to the issue.",
