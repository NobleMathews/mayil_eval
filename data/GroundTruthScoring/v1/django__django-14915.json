    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` object being unhashable and suggests a solution that involves converting the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` to a hashable type before using it as a key in a dictionary. This approach is different from the git diff but aims to achieve the same result, which is to allow the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` to be used as a dictionary key. The RESPONSE suggests using a `prepare_value` method to convert the object, which is a reasonable alternative if such a method exists. However, the git diff directly adds a `__hash__` method to the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class, which is a more straightforward solution and does not require changes to the `create_option` method or the assumption that a `prepare_value` method exists. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class itself, which is a key element of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a viable alternative solution, it does not fully align with the git diff's approach.",
