    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to update the `rm_rf` function in Pytest to use the `onexc` parameter instead of the deprecated `onerror` parameter when calling `rmtree`. This aligns with the git diff, which also updates the `rm_rf` function to use `onexc` and adapts the `on_rm_rf_error` function to handle the new expected signature for `onexc`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests implementing the `addDuration` method in the `TestCaseFunction` class in Pytest, which is also reflected in the git diff where the `addDuration` method is added to the `TestCaseFunction` class.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the conditional check for the Python version when calling `rmtree`, which is present in the git diff. This is a minor omission as the RESPONSE still provides a viable solution to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet for the `addDuration` method, which is not as detailed as the git diff but still offers a valid approach to implementing the required functionality.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes an analysis of various code snippets, most of which are correctly identified as not relevant to the issue. However, this part of the RESPONSE does not directly contribute to resolving the issue and is more of an additional analysis rather than actionable guidance. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing clear and actionable solutions that closely align with the git diff, with minor omissions and additional non-actionable content.",
