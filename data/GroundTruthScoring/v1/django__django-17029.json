    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the `clear_cache` method not clearing the cache for `get_swappable_settings_name`. It provides a clear and actionable solution that directly aligns with the git diff by suggesting the addition of `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` within the `clear_cache` method. The RESPONSE also includes the correct location of the file and method to be modified, and it provides a code snippet that reflects the exact change shown in the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE explains the purpose of the change, which is to ensure that the cache associated with `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared when `clear_cache` is called, aligning with the issue's description of the expected behavior. The RESPONSE is complete, accurate, and would effectively resolve the issue if followed.",
