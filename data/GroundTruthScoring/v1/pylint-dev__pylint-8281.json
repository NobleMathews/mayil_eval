    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and actionable steps to implement globbing patterns for source roots, which is aligned with the issue's request. It correctly suggests modifying the command-line argument parsing and using the glob module to expand patterns. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific files and functions that need to be changed. The git diff shows changes in `pylint/config/argument.py`, `pylint/config/option.py`, `pylint/lint/base_options.py`, and `pylint/pyreverse/main.py`, while the RESPONSE suggests modifying `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py` and `discover_package_path` function, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides a detailed implementation that is not present in the git diff, and it does not mention the renaming of the transformer function to `_glob_paths_csv_transformer` or the change in the option type to `glob_paths_csv`, which are key elements in the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly suggest updating the help text for the `--source-roots` option, which is consistent with the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks specific details and does not fully match the changes shown in the git diff.",
