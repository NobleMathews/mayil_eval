    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `NamedValuesListIterable.__iter__` method and the `create_namedtuple_class` function, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `resolve_lookup_value` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to handle named tuples correctly when reconstituting them. The RESPONSE does not address the correct location of the issue nor does it suggest a similar solution to the git diff. Therefore, it does not provide actionable, relevant guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
