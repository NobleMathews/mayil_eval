    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `colorbar` function when a mappable is not attached to an `Axes` object and suggests a solution that involves raising a more informative error message, which is in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE's proposed code change is similar to the git diff in that it checks for the presence of an `Axes` object and raises a ValueError if it is not found. However, the RESPONSE does not include the additional context provided by the git diff, such as handling the case where `ax` is `None` and the mappable's `Axes` is not available, and the specific error message to guide the user to provide either the `cax` or `ax` argument or add the mappable to an `Axes`. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix but provide context, which is not necessary for the fix but does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and alignment with the git diff, despite minor differences in the implementation details.",
