    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and a detailed breakdown of steps to implement the feature request, which is to allow `autodoc_docstring_signature` to pick up all overloaded method signatures. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `DocstringSignatureMixin` class in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module, including the addition of new attributes, changes to the `_find_signature` method, and updates to the `get_doc` and `format_signature` methods to handle multiple signatures. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying the `sphinx.ext.autosummary` extension and provides a general approach without specific code changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a pseudo-code example that does not reflect the changes in the git diff and mentions files and snippets that are not part of the diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the issue of handling overloaded methods, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Therefore, the score is low, reflecting the lack of alignment with the git diff and the absence of a valid alternative approach.",
