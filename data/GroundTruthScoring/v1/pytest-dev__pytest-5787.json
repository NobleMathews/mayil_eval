    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue of exception serialization not including chained exceptions when using pytest-xdist.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests upgrading pytest, reporting the issue to maintainers, or running tests without parallel execution as workarounds. However, none of these suggestions align with the git diff, which provides a concrete implementation to serialize and deserialize exception chains properly within the pytest codebase. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of exception serialization and does not provide any actionable code changes or insights that would help in resolving the issue. Additionally, the code snippets provided are irrelevant and do not contribute to fixing the issue.",
