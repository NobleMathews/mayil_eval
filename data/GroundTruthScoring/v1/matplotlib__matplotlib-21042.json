    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `__setitem__` and `__getitem__` methods in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` to handle deprecated parameters by checking against a deprecation map and skipping the setting of deprecated parameters. It also recommends issuing a warning using `_api.warn_deprecated`.\n\nThe git diff provided shows changes to the `copy` method of the `RcParams` class and the initialization of `rcParamsOrig` to avoid copying deprecated parameters. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `copy` method and instead suggests a different strategy involving the `__setitem__` method.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE's suggestion to handle deprecation in the `__setitem__` method could be a valid approach to prevent setting deprecated parameters, it does not match the git diff's solution of modifying the `copy` method to create a clean copy of `rcParams` without deprecated parameters. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the initialization of `rcParamsOrig` in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of deprecated parameters, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
