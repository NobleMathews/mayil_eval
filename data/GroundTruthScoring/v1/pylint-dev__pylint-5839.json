    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying `check_msgid_and_symbol` in `message_id_store.py` to check for deleted message ids and symbols, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of preventing the reuse of old message ids or symbols. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to `message_id_store.py` or the creation of `is_deleted_msgid` and `is_deleted_symbol` functions. Instead, the git diff shows changes to `__init__.py`, `unsupported_version.py`, and `constants.py` to handle the reservation of old message ids and the addition of new messages, as well as updates to `get_unused_message_id_category.py` to include deleted message id prefixes in the calculation of the next code category.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the issue by updating constants and scripts to reserve and track deleted message ids. It also does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score between 1 and 3. A score of 2 is given as the RESPONSE is on the right track regarding the prevention of reuse but does not provide the correct implementation details or files to be modified as per the git diff.",
