    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general investigation strategy rather than specific actionable steps to resolve the issue. It suggests reviewing the changeset, ensuring methods are handling clauses correctly, and running tests, which are standard debugging practices but do not directly address the specific problem described in the issue or the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to create a copy of the field object before modifying its expression, which is the key action in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader context of the issue, it lacks the actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to fixing the problem. Therefore, it does not provide significant value towards resolving the issue as presented.",
