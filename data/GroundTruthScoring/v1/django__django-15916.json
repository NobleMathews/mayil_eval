    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described. It suggests checking if `MyForm.Meta` has a `formfield_callback` attribute and ensuring it is not overwritten when `modelform_factory` is called, which aligns with the git diff that adds the `formfield_callback` attribute to the `ModelFormOptions` class and uses it in the `ModelFormMetaclass`. The RESPONSE also proposes modifying the `modelform_factory` function to check if `form.Meta.formfield_callback` exists and use it, which is a valid alternative approach to the git diff's solution of directly setting the `formfield_callback` in the `ModelFormOptions` class. The RESPONSE's suggestion to set the `formfield_callback` on the `Meta` class if it is provided or obtained from `form.Meta` is a reasonable solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to test the changes to confirm that `FactoryForm` uses the `formfield_callback` from `MyForm.Meta`. However, the RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's approach of removing the local handling of `formfield_callback` in the `ModelFormMetaclass` and instead setting it in the `ModelFormOptions` class. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a viable alternative solution, it does not perfectly align with the git diff's approach, which is why it does not score a 10.",
