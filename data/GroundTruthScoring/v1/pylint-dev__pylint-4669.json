    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `Similar` class `__init__` method to set `self.namespace.ignore_signatures` to `False` by default and ensuring that the `ignore-signatures` option is correctly passed and respected in the `Similar` class methods. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `stripped_lines` function to handle cases where a function has a docstring-only body. The RESPONSE does not address this specific issue and instead provides general advice on handling the `ignore-signatures` option, which is not directly related to the problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the fix required, as evidenced by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves a similar result.",
