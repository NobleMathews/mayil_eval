    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions, such as commenting out the default ordering in the `Meta` class, using `order_by` with explicit ordering, using `F` expressions, inspecting the generated SQL query, checking the `ForeignKey` definition, and considering a Django upgrade or reporting the issue. However, these suggestions do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `find_ordering_name` function in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to address the issue with the self-referencing foreign key ordering. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying this function or the logic within it, which is the core of the solution in the git diff. Instead, the RESPONSE focuses on general troubleshooting steps and ORM query adjustments that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. While some of the RESPONSE's suggestions could be helpful in a broader context, they do not offer a solution that aligns with or achieves the same result as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
