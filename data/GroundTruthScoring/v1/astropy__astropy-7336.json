    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_validate_arg_value` function in `decorators.py` to check if the return annotation is `None` and skip the unit conversion if it is. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual change needed is in the `wrapper` function, specifically in the conditional check for the return annotation. The RESPONSE does not address the correct location of the change nor the correct logic to handle the `None` return type. Instead of modifying the `_validate_arg_value` function, the git diff indicates that the condition should be updated to check if the return annotation is not `inspect.Signature.empty` or `None`. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, and the alternative it suggests is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the issue with the `quantity_input` decorator and the `None` return type, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0. However, the proposed solution is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative.",
