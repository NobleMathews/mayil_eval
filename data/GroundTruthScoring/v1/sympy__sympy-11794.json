    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a step-by-step guide on how to implement ASCII printing for Singularity Functions in the Sympy library, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_print_SingularityFunction` method in the `pretty.py` file and provides a code snippet that could potentially be used for ASCII printing. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a different approach where the `base` is created by calling `_print_seq` with the `shift` variable and the `n` is printed separately, then combined using exponentiation. The RESPONSE suggests using `prettyForm` and manually appending the shift and angle brackets, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also does not mention the removal of the `self._print_Function(e)` call, which is present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and provides some actionable advice, it does not closely match the git diff's approach and is incomplete in terms of the changes shown in the git diff.",
