    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifications to the `prepare_crash_report` function in `pylint/lint/utils.py` to handle cases where no template is provided. However, the git diff provided shows changes to the `get_ast` method in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, which is unrelated to the `prepare_crash_report` function or the handling of templates. The RESPONSE does not address the changes in the git diff, such as adding type hints, raising a specific exception, and updating exception handling. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff. As a result, the RESPONSE is not helpful in resolving the issue described in the git diff and should be scored as a 0.",
