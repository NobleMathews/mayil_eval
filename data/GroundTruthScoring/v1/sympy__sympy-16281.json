    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `_print_Product` method in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` to adjust the width of the product symbol and remove unnecessary empty lines when `use_unicode=False`. This aligns with the git diff's approach to modifying the same file and method to improve the pretty print representation of the `Product` class.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide a code change that directly matches the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change to the `sign_lines` list construction and the loop that follows, while the RESPONSE suggests a more general approach without specific code changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a conditional check for `self._use_unicode`, which is not present in the git diff, and it does not address the specific changes to the `sign_lines` list that are shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant sections of code. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the issue of the bottom asymmetry or the exact changes to the top bar of the product symbol as shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the same method and file, and it provides a general direction for fixing the issue, but it lacks the specific and detailed changes that are present in the git diff. Therefore, it is scored as a 4.",
