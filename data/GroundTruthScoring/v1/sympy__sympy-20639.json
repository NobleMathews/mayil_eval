{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the pretty printing of `pi**(1/E)` and correctly points to the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file as the location where the fix should be made. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide specific actionable guidance on how to resolve the issue. It does not mention the changes to the `_print_nth_root` and `_print_Pow` methods that are present in the git diff, such as adjusting the handling of the root and exponent, and the conditions for using the root notation. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests testing with the expression `pi**(1/E)` to verify the output, which is aligned with the issue description but does not reflect the actual changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not provide actionable steps for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the necessary detail and actionable content to assist a developer in fixing the issue, warranting a score of 2.",
