    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `is_valid_locale` function and updating the regular expression patterns to handle different case variations and separators for locale codes. It also recommends integrating a `normalize_locale_code` function to convert locale parts to the correct case and format. While these suggestions are relevant to the issue of handling incorrect locale codes, they do not align with the git diff's approach of simply checking for a hyphen in the locale and providing a warning message to the user. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of a warning message, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. However, the RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice that could potentially lead to a more robust solution by normalizing the locale codes, which is why it receives a score of 4. It is partially relevant to the issue but does not closely match the git diff's approach.",
