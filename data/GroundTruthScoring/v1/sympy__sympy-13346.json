    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to investigate and potentially resolve the test failures in a non-NumPy environment, including reviewing test functions, checking a previous temporary fix, applying decorators or fallback methods, running tests without NumPy, and updating CI configurations. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the general process of fixing test failures, they do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue was addressed by removing a method that explicitly converted integers to mpmath floating-point numbers, which could be the source of the test failures when NumPy is not installed. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes related to the `_print_Integer` method in the `MpmathPrinter` class, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It does not address the specific issue of the `_print_Integer` method causing test failures. The score is not lower because the RESPONSE does suggest running tests in a non-NumPy environment, which is a relevant part of verifying the issue, but it fails to provide the necessary guidance to fix the issue as per the git diff.",
