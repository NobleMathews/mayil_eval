    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the alias used in the `aggregate()` method to avoid the conflict with the alias used in `annotate()`. This is a valid workaround for the issue described, as it would prevent the collision of aliases and allow the query to execute correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows a more comprehensive solution involving changes to the Django ORM's internal handling of aggregate and annotate queries to prevent such issues at the framework level. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying problem in the Django codebase that led to the incorrect SQL query generation, which is what the git diff aims to fix. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a workaround for the end-user, it does not provide a solution to the actual issue in the Django codebase, and thus it is only partially relevant.",
