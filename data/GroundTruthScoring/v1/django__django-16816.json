    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a workaround for the issue by defining a method in `QuestionAdmin` to display related `Choice` objects and adding that method's name to `list_display`. While this is a valid approach to display related objects in the Django admin, it does not address the core issue described, which is the lack of error E108 when a non-existent field is referenced in `list_display`. The git diff provided shows a change in the `_check_list_display_item` method to improve the check for fields that should not be used in `list_display`, specifically targeting many-to-many and one-to-many relationships. The RESPONSE does not mention or address this change, nor does it provide an alternative solution to improve the error checking mechanism in Django's admin checks. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it provides a workaround for displaying related objects but fails to address the main issue of improving error E108 to cover the case described. It does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
