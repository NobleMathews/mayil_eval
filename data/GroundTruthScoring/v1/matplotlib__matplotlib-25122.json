    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to remove the use of `np.abs` when correcting the window in the `_spectral_helper` function. The RESPONSE also provides the exact lines of code that need to be changed, which match the git diff. The RESPONSE goes further by offering links to the relevant code snippets, which is not necessary but can be helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not include the changes for the 'magnitude' and 'complex' modes, which were also part of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does address the main issue with the 'psd' mode, which is the focus of the issue description.",
