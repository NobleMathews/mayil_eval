    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately addresses the issue by providing the correct methods to use in order to update the selector colors without using deprecated methods. It suggests using `selector.set_props(facecolor=color)` to replace the deprecated `selector.rect.set_color(color)` and `selector.rectprops.update(dict(facecolor=color))`, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe git diff shows the addition of `set_props` and `set_handle_props` methods to the `Selector` class, which are intended to update the properties of the selector and handle artists. The RESPONSE correctly identifies these methods as the new way to update selector properties following the deprecation of direct attribute access.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE advises against using `selector.artists[0].set_color(color)` as it is not the correct approach according to the new API, which is consistent with the git diff that introduces a more structured way to manage selector artists through properties.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly, matching the git diff's approach to the issue.",
