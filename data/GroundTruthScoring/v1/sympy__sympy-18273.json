    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue, recognizing that it is related to an `IndexError` when using `cse` with `CRootOf`. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Instead of suggesting a code change to the `cse` function, the RESPONSE incorrectly focuses on validating the `index` parameter passed to `CRootOf` and suggests modifying the user's input, which is not the root cause of the issue. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `tree_cse` function in `cse_main.py` to handle `RootOf` instances properly by skipping them during the expression rebuilding process. The RESPONSE does not address this solution and instead provides a general recommendation to investigate the `tree_cse` function without specific actionable steps. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the `__new__` method of the `CRootOf` class, which is not relevant to the fix shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the correct part of the code (the `cse` function and `CRootOf`), but it lacks actionable content that would help resolve the issue as per the git diff, thus warranting a score of 1.",
