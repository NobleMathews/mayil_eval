    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the problem with the `Idx` class not checking for integer bounds when a tuple is provided. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__new__` method to ensure that both elements of the tuple are checked to be integers, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly suggests the use of `fuzzy_not` to handle cases where `is_integer` might return `None`, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of `from sympy.core.logic import fuzzy_not` and the use of `fuzzy_not(range.is_integer)` in the conditional check.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes. The git diff modifies the conditional check for a single `range` object, while the RESPONSE suggests iterating over each bound in the range tuple and checking them individually. This is a slight deviation from the git diff but still addresses the issue effectively.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes additional context by providing links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful but not necessary for fixing the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly address the change in the conditional check for a single `range` object as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. Nonetheless, the RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative and would resolve the issue if implemented.",
