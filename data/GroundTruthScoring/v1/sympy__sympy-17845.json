    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__str__` methods of the `Interval` and `FiniteSet` classes to return strings that can be evaluated as valid Python code to recreate the objects. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `__str__` methods or any other methods related to string representation. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the return values of various functions and methods to use `FiniteSet` instead of Python's set literal `{}`. The RESPONSE does not address the actual changes in the git diff, which involve updating the return values to use `FiniteSet` for consistency within the Sympy library. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and misguided, offering no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue. It does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative approach to the issue described.",
