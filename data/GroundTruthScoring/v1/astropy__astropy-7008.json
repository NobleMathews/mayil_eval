    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a context manager for setting the version set of the constants in the Astropy package, which aligns with the ISSUE's request for a context manager to handle constant versions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows a refactoring of the constants module to use a new utility function `_set_c` to handle the setting of constants, and it introduces a context manager `set_enabled_constants` within the `__init__.py` file of the constants module. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests creating a new context manager class that inherits from `ScienceState` and using the `@contextmanager` decorator, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a significant amount of irrelevant information, such as code snippets to check and references to the `astropy.utils.state.ScienceState` class, which are not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach, and it does not offer a valid alternative solution within the constraints of the software system as demonstrated by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
