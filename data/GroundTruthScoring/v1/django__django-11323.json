    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests extending the `SelectDateWidget` to override the `get_context` method and ensure the first choice is an empty value if the field is required. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `get_context` method to add a placeholder attribute to the year, month, and day select widgets. However, the RESPONSE does not mention adding the placeholder attribute, which is a key part of the git diff's solution to the issue. Instead, it focuses on adding an empty option to the choices, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests using the `use_required_attribute` method from the `Select` class, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is relevant to handling the 'required' attribute correctly. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are helpful for locating the relevant sections of the codebase but do not directly address the changes made in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff, but it is incomplete and does not fully address the issue as described.",
