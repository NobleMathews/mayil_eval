    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps to implement the feature request described in the issue, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_is_ignored_file` function in `expand_modules.py` and updating the `ignore-paths` option in `base_options.py`, but these files and functions do not exist in the git diff, indicating that the RESPONSE is not aligned with the actual changes made to resolve the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a detailed implementation plan and code snippets, but these do not reflect the changes in the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the `option.py` file to add a new validator function `_regexp_paths_csv_validator`, updates to the `expand_modules.py` file to change the type of `ignore_list_paths_re`, and changes in `pylinter.py` to handle the new `ignore-paths` option. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific changes.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a section with code snippets to check, which is not directly related to the actionable steps needed to resolve the issue. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to normalize paths, it does not provide the specific guidance or solutions that align with the git diff, resulting in a score of 2.",
