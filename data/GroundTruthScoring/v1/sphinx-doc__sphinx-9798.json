    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps, such as updating the `conf.py` file, ensuring correct type hints, updating Sphinx, checking for updates in the `merge_typehints` function, and ensuring proper documentation of classes. However, these suggestions do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff, which involves modifying the `sphinx/domains/python.py` file to handle the `Literal` annotation values correctly within the Sphinx documentation generation process.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Instead, it offers general advice that is only tangentially related to the problem at hand. The RESPONSE fails to address the core issue of the `Literal` annotation values being flagged incorrectly and does not suggest modifying the code to handle this case, as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a link to the relevant file and lines in the Sphinx repository, which could potentially help the developer locate the area of the codebase that needs attention. However, it does not offer any specific instructions or code changes that would help resolve the issue, unlike the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it acknowledges the problem with the `Literal` annotation and provides links to the codebase, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's solution. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
