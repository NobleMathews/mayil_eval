    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to add app label validation to the `showmigrations` command in Django, which is the issue described. It suggests modifying the `showmigrations.py` file to include app label validation logic and provides a code snippet demonstrating how to integrate the validation into the command. The RESPONSE's approach is to use a `_validate_app_labels` method to check the provided app labels and raise a `CommandError` if any are invalid, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of writing to stderr and exiting with a status code of 2. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests raising a `CommandError` instead of writing to stderr and exiting, but it achieves a similar result in terms of validating app labels and halting execution if invalid labels are found. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code, which is helpful for context but not necessary for the solution. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, though it does not match it exactly.",
