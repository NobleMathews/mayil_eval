{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately instructs the developer to remove the `labels` parameter from the `hamming_loss` function signature and to replace any usage of `labels` within the function with `y_true.shape[1]`, which is consistent with the git diff. It also correctly advises updating the documentation to reflect these changes and ensuring that the function still raises appropriate errors for invalid input, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention adding a deprecation warning for the `labels` parameter, which is included in the git diff. However, it does cover the removal of the parameter and the necessary code adjustments, which are the primary objectives of the issue. The RESPONSE also provides additional guidance on checking for invalid input shapes or types, which, while not explicitly mentioned in the git diff, is a good practice when modifying a function's signature and behavior.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes links to code snippets, which are not necessary for the developer to fix the issue but do not detract from the overall quality of the RESPONSE. These links could be seen as additional, albeit unnecessary, resources for the developer.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a high score.",
