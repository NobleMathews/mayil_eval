    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing `args` and `kwargs` methods in the `String` class to support argument invariance, which is aligned with the git diff that shows the addition of a `kwargs` method and modifications to the `String` class to inherit from `Atom`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that `args` should return an empty tuple and `kwargs` should return an empty dictionary, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to ensure `expr.func(*expr.args) == expr` and `expr.func(**expr.kwargs()) == expr` hold true for instances of `String`. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the inheritance from `Atom` or the addition of the `func` property, which are present in the git diff. These omissions prevent the RESPONSE from scoring higher, as they are key to the issue of argument invariance for the `String` class.",
