    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `Product` instance's `sku` primary key is set before it is assigned to the `Order` instance, which is a valid suggestion but does not address the core issue described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE also recommends using the `full_clean` method to validate the `sku` before saving the `Order` instance, which is not related to the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE does not mention or align with the git diff's solution, which involves changing the check from `getattr(self, field.attname) is None` to `getattr(self, field.attname) in field.empty_values`. This change is crucial as it allows the system to recognize empty values for non-numeric primary keys correctly. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific change needed in the Django model's base code to prevent data loss, which is the essence of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
