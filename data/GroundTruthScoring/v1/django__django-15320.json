    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'as_sql' method in the 'Subquery' class to ensure that the SQL string is not altered by removing the first and last characters. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix involves cloning the queryset's query and setting the 'subquery' attribute to True in the 'Subquery' constructor. The RESPONSE does not address the correct part of the code, nor does it offer a viable alternative to the git diff. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the 'as_sql' method and the provided code snippet do not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and would not resolve the problem described in the ISSUE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and does not provide any value in the context of the git diff.",
