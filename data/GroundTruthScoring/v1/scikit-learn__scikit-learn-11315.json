    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if `self.transformers` is empty before trying to unpack in `_BaseComposition._set_params` and modifying the `_transformers` getter and setter in `ColumnTransformer` to handle the case when `self.transformers` is empty. These suggestions are relevant to the issue, which is about handling the case when there are no estimators in `_BaseComposition._set_params`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff. The git diff includes changes to the `ColumnTransformer` class to support a new feature where the `remainder` parameter can be an estimator, and it also includes a fix to the `_BaseComposition.get_params` method to correctly handle the `deep` parameter. The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead focuses on handling empty transformers, which is only a part of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `chain` import from `itertools`, which is present in the git diff and is used to chain the transformers with the remainder transformer when necessary. It also does not address the changes made to the `_validate_remainder` method and other methods in `ColumnTransformer` that are part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a partial solution to the issue by suggesting handling empty transformers but does not cover the full scope of changes in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4 for offering some actionable advice that is relevant but incomplete.",
