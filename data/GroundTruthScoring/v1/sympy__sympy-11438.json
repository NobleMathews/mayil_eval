    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `classify_diop` function misclassifying equations where the powers of the variables are not the same. The proposed solution is to update the `GeneralSumOfEvenPowers.matches` method to check that all powers are the same, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to ensure that all terms are powers with the same even exponent.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests modifying a different part of the code (a method within the `GeneralSumOfEvenPowers` class) than the git diff, which modifies the `classify_diop` function directly. However, the RESPONSE's approach is still a valid alternative that achieves the same goal of correctly classifying the equation.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution, including a code snippet that could be used to fix the issue. It does not directly match the git diff, but it is a relevant and effective alternative approach to solving the problem. Therefore, it receives a high score for its utility in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
