    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to update the `default_error_messages` in the `DurationField` class to reflect the correct format, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also goes beyond the git diff by suggesting the addition of `help_text` to the `DurationField` constructor, which is a valuable suggestion considering the issue's mention of the syntax not being self-explanatory. Furthermore, the RESPONSE includes additional steps to ensure that the `to_python` and `formfield` methods are consistent with the changes, which, while not directly mentioned in the git diff, are relevant and important for a comprehensive solution. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it achieves the same result and provides a viable alternative approach to fixing the issue. The RESPONSE is only missing the actual implementation of the `help_text` parameter, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
