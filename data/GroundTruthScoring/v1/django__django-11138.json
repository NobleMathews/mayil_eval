    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with timezone handling in Django's database backends for MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle. It suggests reviewing and modifying the `CONVERT_TZ` function usage in the `mysql/operations.py` file and adjusting the logic to respect the `TIME_ZONE` setting from the `DATABASES` configuration. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable changes that align with the git diff. The git diff shows detailed code modifications across multiple files, including changes to function signatures and the addition of conditional logic to handle time zone conversions correctly. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these specific changes or the need to update other database backends beyond MySQL. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section with code snippets to check, which is not directly actionable and does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to closely match the git diff.",
