    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps that might be taken to implement `constrained_layout` support for `figure.legend` in Matplotlib, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_constrained_layout.py` module and to consider the legend's size and location when calculating layout constraints. The RESPONSE also suggests testing with various configurations, which is a good practice.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. The git diff shows actual code modifications to several files, including `figlegend_demo.py`, `_constrained_layout.py`, `_axes.py`, `figure.py`, and `legend.py`, which are not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's pseudo-code is too general and does not match the complexity and specificity of the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section with 'Code snippets to check' that seems to be a placeholder or template text and does not provide actionable information. This section does not add value to the RESPONSE in the context of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a starting point for addressing the issue but lacks the actionable detail and specificity provided in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it is incomplete and only partially relevant.",
