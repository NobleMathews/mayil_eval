    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests increasing the `figsize`, adjusting `constrained_layout` padding and spacing parameters, and possibly disabling `constrained_layout` or using `tight_layout` as alternatives. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff, which shows a change in the `text.py` file where the `get_text()` method is replaced with `_get_wrapped_text().split(\"\\n\")` to ensure proper handling of wrapped text in constrained layouts.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed to fix the issue, which involves modifying the text handling in the library. Instead, it suggests workarounds that do not resolve the underlying bug. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, as they do not pertain to the changes in the `text.py` file.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue, and it does not help the developer in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
