{
    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or provides a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `keep_intermediate_files` property from `ManifestFilesMixin`, which contradicts the git diff that introduces this property with a default value of `False`. The RESPONSE also recommends modifying the `post_process` method and adding a cleanup step in the `collectstatic` management command, which are not part of the git diff. The git diff shows a simpler solution by adding a conditional check before saving the intermediate file, controlled by the `keep_intermediate_files` property. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and introduces additional steps that are not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff and instead offers a solution that would not resolve the issue as described. The RESPONSE is scored a 1 because it does mention the `keep_intermediate_files` property, but the advice given is the opposite of what is needed according to the git diff.",
