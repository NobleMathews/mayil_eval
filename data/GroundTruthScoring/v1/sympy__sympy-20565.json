    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_contains` method to handle floating-point numbers by converting them to `Rational` before checking if they are rational. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it attempts to ensure that floating-point numbers are recognized as rational by the `Rationals` class. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which removes the check for `other.is_Number` and relies on `other.is_rational` to determine if the number is rational. The RESPONSE adds an extra conversion step and retains the `other.is_Number` check, which is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear or direct solution to the issue as described in the git diff, and it introduces additional logic that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer a solution that closely matches the git diff.",
