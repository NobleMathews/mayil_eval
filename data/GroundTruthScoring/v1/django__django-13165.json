    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not directly address the issue described in the ISSUE section or align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that every `ExpressionWrapper` has an `output_field` specified, which is a general good practice but does not resolve the specific problem of `ExpressionWrapper` losing the `output_field` for combined expressions without an `output_field`. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `ExpressionWrapper` class to ensure that the `output_field` is preserved when creating group by columns, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some general advice on specifying `output_field` and includes a corrected line of code that adds an `output_field` to the `Sum` function. However, this does not address the core issue of the `ExpressionWrapper` class behavior, which is the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be related to the issue, but these do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the specific problem.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the importance of specifying `output_field`, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the specific issue described. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
