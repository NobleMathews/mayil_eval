    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of two proposed methods to implement the feature of recording the original data size in the WCS object, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and lacks actionable guidance that matches the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE discusses two potential solutions to the issue of recording the original data size in the WCS object, which is the core of the ISSUE. However, it does not provide specific, actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves deprecating the private attributes '_naxis1' and '_naxis2' and using the 'pixel_shape' property instead. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach but instead suggests adding new public attributes or creating a subclass, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes pseudo-code examples that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader topic of recording data size in the WCS object, but it fails to provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
