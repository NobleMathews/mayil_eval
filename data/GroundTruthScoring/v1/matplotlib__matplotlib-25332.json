    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff in addressing the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the call to `fig.align_labels()` before pickling the figure or manually aligning labels after unpickling, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue is resolved by implementing `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in the `Grouper` class to handle the pickling of weak references, which is the root cause of the pickling error. The RESPONSE does not address the actual issue of weak references causing the pickling error and instead suggests workarounds that do not solve the underlying problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, as the git diff indicates that changes are needed in the `cbook.py` file, not in the `figure.py` file or the examples provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
