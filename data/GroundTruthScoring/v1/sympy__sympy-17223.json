    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file and method (`matches` in `sympy/core/mul.py`) that needs to be modified, which is relevant to the issue. It also correctly identifies the need to handle non-commutative symbols, particularly `MatrixSymbol` instances, and suggests modifying the `_matches_noncomm` method to handle the order of matrix multiplication. However, the RESPONSE lacks actionable content and does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the necessary modifications. It does not align closely with the git diff, which includes specific changes to the `matches` method and the addition of new static methods `_matches_expand_pows`, `_matches_noncomm`, `_matches_add_wildcard`, `_matches_new_states`, `_matches_match_wilds`, and `_matches_get_other_nodes`. The RESPONSE does not mention these new methods or the detailed logic changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and specificity found in the git diff.",
