{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the feature to allow `manage.py diffsettings` to compare against another settings module. It suggests modifying the `handle` method to accept a new command-line argument and updating the `Settings` class to handle the import of the specified settings module. The RESPONSE also includes a high-level overview of the changes needed in `diffsettings.py` and `django/conf/__init__.py`, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a new argument and modifying the `handle` method to use a custom settings module if provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests using `import_module` to import the specified settings module, whereas the git diff uses `Settings(default)` to achieve the same result. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is still a valid and effective way to implement the feature, and it does not deviate significantly from the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE could have been more aligned with the git diff by suggesting the exact changes made in the diff, such as the addition of the `--default` argument with the `metavar` and `default` options. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use `import_module` is a reasonable alternative and does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE in assisting a developer to fix the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and achieves a similar result, despite not matching the git diff exactly.",
