    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general outline of steps to resolve the issue with `xarray` not being able to handle \"L\" and \"U\" frequency strings, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it lacks actionable content that directly aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `Millisecond` and `Microsecond` classes are properly defined with the `_freqstr` attributes set to \"L\" and \"U\" respectively, but the git diff shows that the attribute used is `_freq` and not `_freqstr`. Additionally, the RESPONSE mentions updating the `cftime_range` function and the `_CFTimeFrequencyInferer` class, as well as adding tests, but it does not provide specific code changes or guidance on how to implement these updates. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets to check, but these links are not actionable and do not provide direct assistance in making the necessary code changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer the clear, actionable guidance needed to closely match the git diff.",
