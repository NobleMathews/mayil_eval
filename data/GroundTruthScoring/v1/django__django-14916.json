{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a __copy__ method for shallow copying and modifying the clone method to use this new method. It also suggests ensuring that the __deepcopy__ method is correctly implemented for cases where a deep copy is necessary. While the RESPONSE does address the performance issue of the `WhereNode.clone` method, it does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a specific change to the `clone` method, where it loops through `self.children` and conditionally clones each child if it has a `clone` method, otherwise it appends the child directly. The RESPONSE, however, suggests using `copy.copy(self)` and a list comprehension for deep copying children if necessary, which is a different approach than what is shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for further investigation, which is not directly actionable for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear and direct solution that aligns with the git diff, and therefore, it only partially addresses the issue. The score of 2 reflects that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
