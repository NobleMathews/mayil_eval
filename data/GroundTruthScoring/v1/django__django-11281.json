    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to receive a score.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating locale files to replace straight quotes with curly quotes, double hyphens with em dashes, and triple periods with ellipses. However, the git diff provided shows changes made directly to Python files within the Django project, not locale files. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves modifying string literals in the source code to improve typography. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly states that the provided code snippets do not require changes, while the git diff clearly shows that changes are necessary in various parts of the codebase. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described and warrants a score of 0.",
