    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary changes to the `sphinx/transforms/i18n.py` file to address the issue, which is to stop the deletion of the 'translated' attribute from nodes. It provides clear instructions to locate the `Locale` transform class, find the specific code snippet, and either comment out or remove the lines that delete the 'translated' attribute. This guidance is perfectly aligned with the git diff provided, which shows the removal of the lines that delete the 'translated' attribute. The RESPONSE also includes a reminder to test the changes and consider the implications of making an internal attribute public, which is thoughtful and relevant advice for the developer. The RESPONSE does not introduce any new information or alternative solutions that would deviate from the git diff, making it a perfect match for the issue at hand.",
