{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely matches the git diff. It suggests using `inspect.unwrap(obj)` to retrieve the original function object from the decorated `__init__` method, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the issue with the `cls = obj.__globals__[cls_path]` line and provides a clear explanation of how the proposed change will fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the surrounding code and the exact implementation details, but the core solution is the same, which is to use `inspect.unwrap(obj)` to fix the issue with the decorated `__init__` method not being documented. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
