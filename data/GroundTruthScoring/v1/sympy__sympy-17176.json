{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_finger` function to account for the structure of the boolean expressions more comprehensively, which is aligned with the general direction of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific or actionable solution that matches the git diff's approach of changing the fingerprinting mechanism to use a sorted tuple of tuples. Instead, it suggests a recursive approach without clear implementation details, which does not directly address the issue of generating unique fingerprints for different boolean expressions. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a large section of irrelevant information regarding code snippets to check, which does not contribute to solving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, therefore it receives a score of 2.",
