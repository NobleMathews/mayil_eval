    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the core issue described. The git diff shows that the problem was resolved by removing the manipulation of the layout engine during the adjustment and restoration of the bounding box. The RESPONSE, however, suggests removing the 'compressed' layout option, resetting the layout, or saving the figure to a different object, none of which are reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff and does not help the developer fix the issue as described. The only reason it does not score a 0 is that it attempts to address the issue of the layout not being applied correctly on the second save, but the suggestions are not supported by the git diff and are not likely to resolve the issue.",
