    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying a file and function that do not exist in the git diff provided. It refers to `django/utils/regex_helper.py` and a `simplify_regex` function within it, which is not the file or function being modified according to the git diff. The git diff shows changes in `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py` and `django/contrib/admindocs/views.py`, specifically adding functionality to handle non-capturing groups in regex patterns. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide actionable guidance based on the actual changes required. It also incorrectly references a GitHub repository and provides links to non-existent code snippets, which would not assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
