    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests renaming the `msg` parameter to `reason` in the `pytest.skip` function, which aligns with the issue's description of achieving consistency across pytest functions and marks. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the function signature and calls to `pytest.skip` throughout the codebase, which is in line with the git diff's changes.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE fails to mention the other changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to `pytest.fail`, `pytest.exit`, and the introduction of the `KEYWORD_MSG_ARG` deprecation warning in `_pytest/deprecated.py`. It also does not address the changes in exception handling and the use of `super()` in `_pytest/outcomes.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests searching for instances of `pytest.skip` and updating the parameter from `msg` to `reason`, which is a correct action but does not reflect the comprehensive changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide any guidance on implementing a deprecation warning for the use of `msg` in `pytest.skip`, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests planning for the removal of the `msg` parameter in a future major release, which is a reasonable suggestion but is not explicitly covered in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and does not address all relevant changes. Therefore, it scores a 3 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
