    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_image_dimensions` function to raise a `FileNotFoundError` when the file does not exist. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which instead wraps the file opening in a try-except block and returns `(None, None)` if an `OSError` occurs. The RESPONSE's suggestion to raise an exception would change the behavior of the function and potentially require changes in all calling code to handle the new exception, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff's approach is to handle the error internally and return a value that indicates the image dimensions could not be obtained, which is a less disruptive change. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
