    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and pseudo-code for implementing the `get_feature_names` method within the `CategoricalEncoder` class, which is relevant to the ISSUE requesting the addition of such a method. The RESPONSE correctly suggests using `check_is_fitted` to ensure the encoder is fitted and discusses generating feature names based on the categories learned during fitting. It also correctly addresses the handling of input features and the possibility of different encoding types (one-hot vs. ordinal). However, the RESPONSE does not align perfectly with the git DIFF, which specifically adds the `get_feature_names` method to the `OneHotEncoder` class, not the `CategoricalEncoder`. The git DIFF also includes a specific implementation with error handling for the length of `input_features` and the construction of feature names using a combination of input feature names and category labels, which is not fully captured in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's mention of handling unknown categories and drop parameters is not reflected in the git DIFF, indicating a slight misalignment. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for further research, which, while potentially helpful, do not directly contribute to solving the ISSUE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not closely match the git DIFF in its entirety.",
