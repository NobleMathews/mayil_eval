    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is relevant to the issue and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on how to use `annotate()` and `union()` in Django querysets, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the internal handling of annotation masks within the Django ORM to ensure that the order of columns is preserved when using `annotate()` with `union()`. The RESPONSE suggests workarounds such as including annotated columns in `values()` and setting a default value for annotations, but it does not provide a solution to the underlying problem in the Django codebase that the git diff aims to fix. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
