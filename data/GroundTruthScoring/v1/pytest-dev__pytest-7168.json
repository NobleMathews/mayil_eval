    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `SomeClass` implementation by raising specific exceptions with messages in the `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` methods. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which makes a change in the `_format_repr_exception` function within the `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file to handle exceptions raised during the representation of objects. The RESPONSE does not address the actual issue, which is an INTERNALERROR within pytest when an exception occurs in the `__repr__` method of an object. The git diff suggests a fix within the pytest codebase itself, not within the user's code that is being tested. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in resolving the issue described and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff. It fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
