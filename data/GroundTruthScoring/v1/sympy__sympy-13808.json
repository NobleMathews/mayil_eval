    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using manual integration techniques, checking for updates, and reporting the issue to the SymPy developers. While these are general good practices, they do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was addressed by adding handling for `atan` terms and their arguments involving `tan` and `cot` functions within the integration code. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the integration code or handling specific functions like `atan`, `tan`, or `cot`. The RESPONSE does provide a workaround using manual integration, but this does not reflect the changes in the git diff, which aims to fix the issue within the library's codebase. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant as it does not guide the developer on how to implement the necessary changes to the codebase as shown in the git diff.",
