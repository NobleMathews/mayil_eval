    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described, nor does it align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the codeprinter.py and precedence.py files to handle the unary minus and Mod function precedence correctly, which is the root cause of the issue. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, offers general advice on checking and modifying the implementation of the `Mod` function and the `lambdify` function, without specific guidance on how to address the problem. It also suggests checking if the `Mod` function is being simplified or transformed incorrectly, which is not directly related to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable steps that would lead to a resolution of the issue, and it does not provide an alternative approach that would achieve the same result as the git diff. However, it does mention the `Mod` function and the `lambdify` function, which are relevant to the issue, hence it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
