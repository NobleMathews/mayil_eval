{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating various methods and adding system checks to handle the transition from `index_together` to `indexes` and suppress deprecation warnings. However, the git diff provided shows a specific implementation within the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file that directly addresses the issue by modifying the `reduce` method to handle `AddIndex`, `RemoveIndex`, and `RenameIndex` operations. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `reduce` method and instead suggests a broader set of changes across multiple files and methods. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader issue of transitioning from `index_together` to `indexes`, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these do not directly relate to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a low score for its lack of alignment with the git diff and for not providing a clear, actionable solution to the specific issue described.",
