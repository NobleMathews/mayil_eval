    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are somewhat relevant to the issue, including identifying the problematic commit, reviewing the changes, and suggesting to change the `follow_symlinks` parameter back to `True`. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change needed in the code, which is to remove the `follow_symlinks=False` argument entirely as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes additional steps that are not directly related to the fix, such as updating configuration or command-line options, which are not mentioned in the git diff or the issue. The RESPONSE does correctly suggest testing the changes and preparing a pull request, which are good practices but do not directly contribute to solving the issue at hand. The code snippet provided is not directly relevant to the fix required, as the git diff points to a different file and section of code (`src/_pytest/pathlib.py`).",
