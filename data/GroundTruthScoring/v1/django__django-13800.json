    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the serialization process in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py` to ensure RFC 6265 compliance, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the `MessageEncoder` class, the introduction of a new `MessageSerializer` class, and modifications to the `_encode` and `_decode` methods in the `CookieStorage` class. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the introduction of the new serializer class. Instead, it suggests using the `django.utils.http` module for URL encoding, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also references a non-existent `MessagePartSerializer` class and provides general advice on testing without specific instructions. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to modify the serialization process, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
