{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue of ensuring that the auto-reloader passes the -X options for the cpython implementation. It suggests modifying the `run_with_reloader` function and updating the `get_child_arguments` function, which is consistent with the git diff that modifies the `get_child_arguments` function to include the -X options. The RESPONSE also mentions ensuring that the `StatReloader` class respects the -X options and that the `runserver` command handles them correctly, which are reasonable suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed, unlike the git diff, which includes the specific lines to be added to `get_child_arguments`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying additional components like `run_with_reloader` and `StatReloader` class, which are not part of the git diff but could be considered as part of a broader solution. The RESPONSE is not a direct match to the git diff but offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
