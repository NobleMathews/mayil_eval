    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests importing the `pkg_resources` module and using `parse_version` to handle version comparison correctly. While this is a valid approach to parsing version strings in Python, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution implemented involves creating a new function `get_numversion_from_version` to parse the version string and handle the comparison. The RESPONSE does not address the creation of this new function or the modification of the `numversion` variable, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of version comparison but fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach.",
