    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS to be a base that can be overridden, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS. It also correctly identifies the need to add a new configuration option, similar to the git diff's addition of 'linkcheck_request_headers'. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the get_request_headers function to merge user-specified headers with the default headers is in line with the git diff's approach to handling headers for each URL.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the exact name of the configuration option added in the git diff ('linkcheck_request_headers'), instead suggesting 'linkcheck_http_headers'. However, this does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the concept is the same and the developer can easily adapt the suggestion to match the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not explicitly mention the use of 'urlparse' from the 'urllib.parse' module, which is introduced in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does imply parsing the URL when discussing how to apply headers for different domains, which suggests an understanding of the need for URL parsing.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable and relevant guidance that would assist the developer in implementing the feature, closely matching the git diff's approach.",
