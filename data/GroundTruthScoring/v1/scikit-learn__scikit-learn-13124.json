    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `StratifiedKFold` class not shuffling samples within each stratum when `shuffle=True` is set. It suggests modifying the `_make_test_folds` method to shuffle the samples within each class before assigning them to folds, which is in line with the git diff that also modifies the `_make_test_folds` method. The RESPONSE also correctly points out the need to use the `random_state` parameter to seed the random number generator before shuffling, which is consistent with the git diff's introduction of `check_random_state(self.random_state)`.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a code snippet that is not exactly the same as the git diff but achieves the same goal of ensuring that the samples within each class are shuffled according to the `random_state` before being assigned to folds. This alternative approach is valid and would likely resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the change in the documentation string from \"Whether to shuffle each stratification of the data before splitting into batches.\" to \"Whether to shuffle each class's samples before splitting into batches.\" as shown in the git diff. This change is important for clarity and to resolve the misleading documentation issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match to the git diff but is highly relevant and offers a clear and actionable solution that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
