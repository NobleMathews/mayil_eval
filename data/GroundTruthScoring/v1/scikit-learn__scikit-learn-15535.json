    "criteria": "The RESPONSE offers some relevant information but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `mutual_info_score` function raising a `ValueError` when passed arrays of object type. It suggests that the function is unable to convert a string to a float due to the input arrays being of object type after using `.astype(object)`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE's proposed solution to modify the `check_clusterings` function to handle object type arrays by encoding them into numeric labels using `LabelEncoder` does not align with the git diff. The git diff suggests a simpler solution by adding `dtype=None` to the `check_array` function calls within `check_clusterings`, which would allow the function to handle object types without explicit conversion.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the `dtype=None` parameter at all, which is a key element of the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests a more complex solution involving `LabelEncoder`, which is not supported by the git diff and may not be necessary given the simpler solution provided in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a relevant link to the code snippet where the issue is located, but it fails to offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
