    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the minor tick formatter is set correctly and not using a `NullFormatter`, adjusting the locator or formatter to differentiate between major and minor ticks, and considering a custom formatter for the minor ticks that avoids labels at major tick positions. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of missing minor ticklabels, they do not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem.\n\nThe git diff introduces a new property `remove_overlapping_locs` to the `Axis` class, which controls whether minor ticker locations that overlap with major ticker locations should be trimmed. It also modifies the `get_minorticklocs` method to use this property when determining which minor tick locations to return. The RESPONSE does not mention adding any new properties or modifying existing methods in the `Axis` class, nor does it suggest a similar approach to handling overlapping tick locations.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion of using a custom formatter is a potential workaround but does not address the underlying issue in the same way as the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and links to parts of the repository that are not directly related to the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach.",
