    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating Sphinx to the latest version or modifying the method implementation to include type hints and a proper docstring. While updating Sphinx could potentially resolve the issue if a fix has been released, the RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the problem described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `example_method` is not aligned with the git diff, which specifically modifies the `_find_signature` method to handle the stripping of return values from signatures in the Sphinx autodoc extension. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the Sphinx extension's handling of overloaded functions and their return types, which is what the git diff aims to fix. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead the developer away from the actual solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with Sphinx and return types but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
