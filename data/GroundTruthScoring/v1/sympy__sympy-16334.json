    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to handle the case when the base is zero and the exponent is a real number not equal to zero, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_eval_is_extended_positive` method to return `False` when the base is zero and the exponent is a real number not equal to zero, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of modifying the `_eval_is_positive` and `_eval_is_negative` methods. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that is very similar to the git diff, although it introduces a conditional return of `None` when `self.exp.is_zero` is `False`, which is not present in the git diff. This additional condition does not align with the git diff but does not necessarily contradict the intended behavior, as it attempts to handle the case when the exponent is exactly zero. The RESPONSE also includes links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the code that needs to be changed. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the `_eval_is_negative` method, which is also addressed in the git diff, hence the score of 7 instead of a higher score.",
