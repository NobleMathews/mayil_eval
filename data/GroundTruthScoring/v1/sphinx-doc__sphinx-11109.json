    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and detailed steps to implement the requested feature in Sphinx, which is to improve the formatting of `Union`, `Optional`, and `Literal` types, as well as syntax highlighting for constants. It suggests adding a new configuration option and modifying the `_parse_annotation` function, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a new configuration option `python_display_short_literal_types` and changes to the `_parse_annotation` function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE introduces a different configuration option `python_use_pep604_syntax` and provides a different implementation approach, which does not directly match the git diff. The git diff specifically adds the `python_display_short_literal_types` configuration option and modifies the handling of `Literal` types within the `_parse_annotation` function to use PEP 604 syntax when the option is enabled. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add syntax highlighting for constants and the handling of `Union` and `Optional` types is not reflected in the git diff, which focuses on the `Literal` type.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue's goal of improving type formatting but does not fully align with the git diff's approach. It offers actionable advice that could lead to a viable alternative solution, but it does not match the git diff in terms of the specific configuration option and the exact changes to the code. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
