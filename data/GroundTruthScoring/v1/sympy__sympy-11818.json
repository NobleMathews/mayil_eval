    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a conceptual explanation of why `oo` (infinity) should not be considered part of `S.Complexes` and why the union operation's current behavior is incorrect. However, it does not offer any actionable guidance or code changes to address the issue. The git diff provided shows specific changes to the `ComplexRegion` and `ProductSet` classes to handle the union operation correctly, which the RESPONSE does not mention or align with.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies that `oo` should not be evaluated as part of `S.Complexes`, but it lacks actionable content that would help the developer fix the issue in the codebase. It does not provide any code changes or suggest modifications to the behavior of the `Union` operation, which is the core of the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable guidance and does not closely match the git diff.",
