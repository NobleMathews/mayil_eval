    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the issue described, which is related to a specific code change in the `radsimp.py` file within the SymPy library. Instead, the RESPONSE provides information about the release of SymPy version 1.6.2 and the inclusion of patches in the master branch. This information is unrelated to the code change required to fix the issue presented in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable guidance or meaningful information that would aid in resolving the code issue, and it does not align with the git diff in any way. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a helpful response.",
