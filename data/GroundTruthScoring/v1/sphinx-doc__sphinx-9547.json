    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests extending the `_parse_simple_type_specifier` method and updating the `_simple_type_specifiers_re` regular expression to include GNU extension types like `_Complex` and `_Fract`. It also mentions updating checks against `_keywords` and `c_extra_keywords` and adding tests for the new types.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it correctly identifies the need to update regular expressions to include new types and to handle these types in the parsing logic. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific regular expression updates or method changes that are present in the git diff. The git diff shows extensive modifications to the regular expressions and parsing logic in both `c.py` and `cpp.py` files, which are not reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `ASTTrailingTypeSpecFundamental` class or other specific modifications shown in the git diff. It also does not address the changes needed in the `cpp.py` file, which are part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to support GNU extension types but does not offer the detailed code changes required, which are shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially helpful for a developer looking to resolve the issue as described.",
