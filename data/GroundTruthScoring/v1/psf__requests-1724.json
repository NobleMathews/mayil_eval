    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing Unicode strings with byte strings in the code where the HTTP method is specified and ensuring all strings representing HTTP methods are byte strings. This advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it pertains to the handling of Unicode strings in Python 2.7. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a line to convert the method to a byte string using the 'builtin_str' function, which is a more precise and direct fix than the general advice given in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, which could lead the developer to look in the wrong places. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and does not provide clear instructions on how to implement the fix. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
