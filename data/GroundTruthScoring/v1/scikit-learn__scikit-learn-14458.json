    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive solution to the issue of ensuring that the input arrays are C-contiguous before they are passed to the `fit` method of the `Ridge` model with `solver='sag'`. It correctly identifies the need to use `numpy.ascontiguousarray` to convert `X` if necessary, which aligns with the git diff that adds `X = np.ascontiguousarray(X)` in the `make_dataset` function. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `make_dataset` function to check for C-contiguity, which is consistent with the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises on the correct use of `check_array` function with the appropriate order parameter, which is reflected in the git diff where `y = check_array(y, dtype=X.dtype, ensure_2d=False, order=None)` is modified. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely matches the git diff. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes a link to code snippets that are not part of the git diff, which, while potentially useful, are not necessary for the solution and thus do not directly contribute to fixing the issue.",
