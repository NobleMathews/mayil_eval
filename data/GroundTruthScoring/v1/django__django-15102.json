    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice regarding the modification of the `django/core/management/templates.py` file to respect the user's umask when creating new files and directories, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of an `apply_umask` function. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `os.makedirs` call and the file creation code, which are not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation of the `apply_umask` function, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that may not be directly relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but does not closely match the git diff in terms of the specific changes needed to address the issue.",
