{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests adding a new entry for \"deg_C\" in the FITS unit format mapping, which is consistent with the git diff that adds \"Celsius\" and \"deg C\" to the `names` dictionary in `fits.py`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `_generate_unit_names` method, which is where the git diff makes changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises following the FITS standard and IAU recommendations, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The suggestion to add a unit test is a good practice, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the change made in `si.py` to add the \"fits\" format to the `deg_C` unit, which is part of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's guidance is still highly relevant and would lead to a resolution of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE receives a high score for its alignment with the git diff and its utility in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
