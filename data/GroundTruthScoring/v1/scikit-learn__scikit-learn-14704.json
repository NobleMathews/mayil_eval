    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the rounding strategy used in the allocation of samples to each fold in the `StratifiedKFold` implementation, which is correct. However, the proposed solution does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff shows a comprehensive change in the implementation, including a new way of encoding the classes, a different method for calculating the allocation array, and a new strategy for assigning samples to test folds. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a simple modification to the allocation strategy that does not reflect the complexity of the changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the proposed solution, which could be misleading. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to a solution similar to the one in the git diff, and therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability.",
