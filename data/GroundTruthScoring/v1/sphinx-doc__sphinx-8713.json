    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_parse_other_parameters_section` method to respect the `napoleon_use_param` setting, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE provides a code snippet that is very similar to the git diff, with the only difference being the handling of the `multiple=True` parameter in the `_consume_fields` method call. This difference does not affect the outcome, as the RESPONSE still achieves the same result as the git diff, which is to make the 'Other Parameters' section respect the `napoleon_use_param` setting.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes references to specific lines of code in the repository, which could help the developer locate the relevant sections of the codebase to implement the fix. This additional information is helpful and relevant, although not strictly necessary for the fix itself.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a solution that would effectively resolve the issue described, and it aligns closely with the git diff's approach. The minor difference in the handling of the `multiple=True` parameter does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE.",
