    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to use `repr` instead of `str` for the variable `c` in the error message, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE also provides a step-by-step guide on how to locate the relevant code section and implement the change, which is helpful for the developer. The RESPONSE even includes the exact code change that needs to be made, which matches the git diff solution. The only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it includes additional information about applying the pattern to other places in the codebase, which, while potentially useful, is not part of the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the value of the RESPONSE.",
