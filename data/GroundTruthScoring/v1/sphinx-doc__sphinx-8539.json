    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section. It provides generic advice about updating the Sphinx configuration and upgrading Sphinx, which does not align with the changes shown in the GIT DIFF. The GIT DIFF shows specific modifications to the Sphinx extension code to handle the type hints issue, including adding a new configuration value and altering the behavior of the type hints merging function. The RESPONSE fails to mention any code changes or acknowledge the nature of the problem, which is related to the handling of type hints in the Sphinx autodoc extension. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
