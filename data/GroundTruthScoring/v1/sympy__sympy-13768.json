    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding dimension validation logic to the `dot` method to ensure that the dimensions of `A` and `B` are either `1 x m` or `n x 1`, which is in line with the git diff's intention to fix dimension mismatches. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that checks for the correct dimensions and raises a `ShapeError` if they are not met, which is similar to the git diff's approach of raising a `ShapeError` for incorrect dimensions.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully capture the complexity of the changes made in the git diff. The git diff introduces a new method `_legacy_array_dot` to handle the deprecated behavior and uses a deprecation warning to inform users about the change in behavior. The RESPONSE does not mention the deprecation warning or the handling of the legacy behavior, which are significant parts of the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `dot` method with parameters `hermitian` and `conjugate_convention`, which are not present in the git diff and are not relevant to the issue described. This inclusion does not align with the git diff and introduces unnecessary complexity.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for further investigation, which could be helpful for understanding the context but are not directly related to the actionable changes required to fix the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and includes some irrelevant details. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it offers a partial solution to the issue.",
