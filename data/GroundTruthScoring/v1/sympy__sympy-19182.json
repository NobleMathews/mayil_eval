    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests general troubleshooting steps for test failures, such as updating Travis CI configuration, checking for syntax errors, updating dependencies, and debugging test cases. However, the git diff provided shows specific changes to the `sympy/core/mul.py` file, which are related to the evaluation of whether a multiplication results in an integer. The RESPONSE does not address the changes in the git diff or the specific issue in the `sympy/core/mul.py` file. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
