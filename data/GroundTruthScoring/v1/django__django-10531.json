    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `LogEntry` model and its methods to ensure that verbose names are used when constructing the `change_message`. This approach is somewhat aligned with the issue, which is about using verbose names in the model's history messages. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `get_change_message` method and adding a new helper function `_get_changed_field_labels_from_form` in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`, as well as adjusting the list comprehension in `django/contrib/admin/models.py` to translate field names. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the addition of a new helper function, nor does it address the need to evaluate `form.changed_data` before disabling translations, which is a key part of the git diff's solution.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is relevant to the issue of using verbose names, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide clear guidance on the specific changes needed, such as the addition of the helper function or the translation of field names before disabling translations. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach.",
