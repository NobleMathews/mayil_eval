    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the base class to be abstract and handling the field name clash by either removing or renaming the conflicting field. While the suggestion to make the base class abstract is already present in the issue description and thus not actionable, the advice to handle the field name clash is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which resolves the issue by removing the condition that prevents overwriting class methods with descriptors. The RESPONSE fails to address the core problem identified in the git diff, which is the need to allow fields to overwrite properties or class methods. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
