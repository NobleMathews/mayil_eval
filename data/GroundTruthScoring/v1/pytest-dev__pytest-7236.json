    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the changelog, downgrading to a previous version, investigating configuration settings, opening an issue with the developers, or conditionally skipping tests without using the decorator. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of skipped tests executing teardown when running with `--pdb`, they do not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the code has been modified to use a new helper function `_is_skipped` to check if a test is skipped, and to prevent teardown from executing in such cases. The RESPONSE does not address the code changes at all and instead offers general troubleshooting steps that are not directly related to the code fix provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue as described and does not align with the git diff's approach.",
