{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance to remove the primary key check from the `__init__` method of the related manager class, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the location of the code to be modified and provides a detailed description of the lines to be removed. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that any other necessary checks for the existence of a primary key are performed at the appropriate time, which is a relevant consideration given the context of the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not mention moving the check to the `get_queryset` method, but it achieves a similar result by removing the overly aggressive check from the `__init__` method. This alternative approach is valid and would resolve the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed. The score is not a 10 because the RESPONSE does not mention moving the check to the `get_queryset` method as the git diff does, but it still provides a highly relevant and actionable solution.",
