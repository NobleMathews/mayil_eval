    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying if 'seaborn-colorblind' is available in Matplotlib 3.6.1, which is somewhat relevant but does not address the underlying issue of the deprecated seaborn styles. It also suggests using an alternative style, downgrading Matplotlib, or manually defining the style parameters, none of which align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows that the issue is resolved by creating a mapping for deprecated seaborn styles and updating the style library to handle these deprecated styles with a warning. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes related to deprecation handling or updating the style library to accommodate the deprecated styles. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution.",
