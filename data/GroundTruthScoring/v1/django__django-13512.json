{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with Unicode characters not displaying properly in Django admin due to the default ASCII encoding of `json.dumps`. The solution provided in the RESPONSE to set `ensure_ascii=False` in the `json.dumps` call within the `prepare_value` method of the `JSONField` class is exactly what is needed and is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly modifies the same file and method (`django/forms/fields.py` and `prepare_value`) as the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes needed in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` as shown in the git diff, which is also part of the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not complete in terms of addressing all parts of the issue as per the git diff, but it is highly relevant and provides clear guidance for the main part of the problem. This warrants a score of 9.",
