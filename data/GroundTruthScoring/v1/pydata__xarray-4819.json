    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement a `drop_isel` method in the `Dataset` class, which is relevant to the issue described. It suggests creating a new method that accepts indexers and uses the existing `isel` method to select and remove indices from the dataset. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also introduces a `drop_isel` method in both the `Dataset` and `DataArray` classes. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's implementation details, such as using `np.delete` to remove indices and updating the dataset using `loc` indexing. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `drop_sel` method, which are included in the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but lacks completeness and full alignment with the git diff.",
