    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `_eval_is_real` methods to return `None` when the argument is not real, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the methods are being updated to return `True` when the argument is real, and no changes are made to return `None`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests changes to `_eval_is_positive` and `_eval_is_negative` methods based on the sign of the argument, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows specific conditions under which these methods should return `True` or `False`, and it does not include the changes suggested by the RESPONSE. Furthermore, the RESPONSE incorrectly states that `asin` and `asec` should return `True` for positive and negative arguments, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE also fails to address the use of `fuzzy_or` in the git diff for the `_eval_is_real` method in `acot`. Overall, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and provides incorrect solutions and advice not supported by the git diff.",
