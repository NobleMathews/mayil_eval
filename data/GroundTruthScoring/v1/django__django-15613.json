    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which involves modifying the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method to include checks for `GenericForeignKey` fields. This aligns well with the git diff, which also modifies the same method to add checks for `GenericForeignKey` fields. The RESPONSE suggests raising a `ValueError` if the related object has not been saved, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to prevent data loss. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a step to set the `gfk_id` and `gfk_ctype` fields if the related object has been saved, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is a relevant and useful addition to the solution. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests using `isinstance(field, GenericForeignKey)` instead of checking for the `fk_field` attribute, and it includes additional logic to set the `gfk_id` and `gfk_ctype` fields. However, these differences do not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as they still address the core issue and provide a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, thus warranting a score of 7.",
