    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the LaTeX configuration in `conf.py` to redefine the `\\sphinxstyleindexentry` command to allow for line breaks within table cells in the index. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves changing the Python code in `sphinx/domains/std.py` to iterate over `signode.get('allnames', [])` instead of splitting the `sig` string. The RESPONSE does not address the Python code change at all and instead provides an unrelated LaTeX configuration change. This does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue as it does not match the git diff's approach nor does it provide an effective alternative solution.",
