    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which involves incorrect MathML representations for certain inverse trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the methods `_print_acoth`, `_print_acsc`, and `_print_asec` need to be implemented or corrected to produce the right MathML output. The provided code snippets for these methods are accurate and would resolve the issue if implemented.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff in terms of the approach taken. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding entries to the `mathml_tag` dictionary for the 'acoth', 'acsc', and 'asec' keys, and then implementing or modifying the corresponding `_print_` methods to use the `dom.createElement` approach instead of returning a string directly. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests returning formatted strings directly, which is a different approach but still valid and would achieve the same result.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests adding unit tests to verify the output, which is a good practice but is not reflected in the git diff. This additional suggestion does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE but rather adds to it, ensuring the correctness of the implementation.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would help in resolving the issue, albeit with a slightly different approach than the one shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
