    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a custom handler for `Text` objects to ensure they appear in the legend, which is a valid approach to the problem described in the ISSUE. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution implemented in the repository involves modifying the existing legend handling code to include `Text` objects directly, rather than creating a custom handler. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the legend handling code and instead proposes an alternative solution that is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets and references to specific lines in the repository, which could be helpful for understanding the context of the issue. However, these references do not directly contribute to resolving the issue as per the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a potentially viable alternative solution but does not align with the git diff's approach to including `Text` objects in the legend. Therefore, it receives a low score for not closely matching the git diff but is not entirely unhelpful as it offers a different valid solution.",
