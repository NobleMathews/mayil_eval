    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests avoiding the intersection with an infinite Cartesian product and instead proposes a method to check each element of the `solution` set to see if it is a natural number. While this approach might be valid in a different context, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff adds a `__bool__` method to the `Intersection` class, which allows the `Intersection` object to be evaluated in a boolean context without raising a `TypeError`. The RESPONSE does not address the addition of the `__bool__` method or any similar modification to the `Intersection` class. Instead, it suggests a workaround that does not directly address the issue of the `Intersection` class lacking a `__bool__` method. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with the intersection of a finite set with an infinite set, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
