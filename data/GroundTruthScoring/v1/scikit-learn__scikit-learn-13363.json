    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests initializing the 'intercept' variable at the beginning of the '_ridge_regression' function to ensure it is defined whether 'return_intercept' is 'True' or 'False'. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, as the original problem was an UnboundLocalError due to 'intercept' being referenced before assignment. However, the RESPONSE does not address the key changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the logic for choosing the solver and raising a ValueError when 'return_intercept' is 'True' and the solver is not 'sag'. The RESPONSE's suggestion to initialize 'intercept' does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, which is to prevent the situation that leads to the error by enforcing solver constraints. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the solver selection logic, which are a significant part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and does not provide a complete or effective solution to the issue.",
