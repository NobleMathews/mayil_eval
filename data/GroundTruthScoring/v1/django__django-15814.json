    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests applying the modification in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` at line 745, changing `opts = cur_model._meta` to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`. This is a highly relevant suggestion that aligns with the git diff, which also adds a line to ensure `cur_model` is set to the concrete model's meta before setting `opts`. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests modifying the line directly, while the git diff adds a new line. However, the end result is effectively the same, which is to ensure that the concrete model's metadata is used.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional code snippets to check, which are relevant to the issue at hand. These snippets are related to the logic for handling `select_related` and `only`, which are part of the problem described in the issue. While these additional snippets are not part of the git diff, they offer valuable context and could be useful for a developer looking to understand the broader implications of the change or to ensure that related code is consistent with the fix.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that is highly relevant to the issue and closely aligns with the git diff's approach, even though it does not match it exactly. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
