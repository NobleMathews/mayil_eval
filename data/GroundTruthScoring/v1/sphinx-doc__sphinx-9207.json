    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding explicit titles to the cross-references in the docstrings to disambiguate between the two `TestError` classes and using `nitpick_ignore` or `nitpick_ignore_regex` options in the Sphinx `conf.py` to ignore the specific warning. While these suggestions might help to suppress the warning, they do not address the underlying issue that the git diff aims to resolve, which is to modify the `resolve_xref` method in `python.py` to handle the case where multiple targets are found for a cross-reference more gracefully by checking for canonical targets.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets in the Sphinx repository, which could be helpful for understanding the context of the issue. However, these links do not offer direct actionable steps to resolve the issue as the git diff does.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information but fails to offer actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
