    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a check to validate the proxy URL format and raising a more informative exception if it is invalid, which aligns with the git diff's approach to raising an `InvalidProxyURL` exception when the proxy URL is malformed. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `InvalidProxyURL` exception in `requests.exceptions` to provide a clearer error message, which is consistent with the git diff adding a new `InvalidProxyURL` class.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests implementing the check in `urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPConnectionPool._prepare_proxy` or `urllib3.util.connection.create_connection`, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the check is implemented in the `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter.get_connection` method, not in the `urllib3` library. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the use of `urllib3.util.parse_url` to parse the proxy URL, which is a key part of the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff, but it is incomplete and suggests changes in locations different from those indicated by the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
