    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach to the issue by suggesting modifications to the Feed class and the Rss201rev2Feed class to allow specifying a feed language different from `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the language setting is being moved from a hardcoded `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` to a dynamic `self.language or get_language()`, which allows for the language to be specified per Feed instance or default to the current language. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests adding a new `language` parameter to the `Feed` class constructor and modifying the `add_root_elements` method in the `Rss201rev2Feed` class, which is not part of the git diff and is not necessary for addressing the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a lot of additional information about checking code snippets and reviewing other files that are not directly related to the changes required to fix the issue, which could potentially lead to confusion. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
