{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to deprecate the `HttpRequest.is_ajax` method, which aligns with the git diff's intention. It suggests adding a deprecation warning within the `is_ajax` method, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of a deprecation warning. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to import `warnings` and `RemovedInDjango40Warning`, which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `request.headers.get(\"X-Requested-With\") == \"XMLHttpRequest\"` as an alternative check, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead modifies other parts of the code to use `request.accepts('text/html')` as a condition for content negotiation, which the RESPONSE does not mention. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a significant portion of the solution, it does not fully match the git diff's approach to replacing `is_ajax` usage in other views. This warrants a score of 7 as it is highly relevant but not a complete match.",
