    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps that might be taken to implement support for nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It correctly identifies that changes need to be made to the `add_filtered_relation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and suggests removing the restriction that raises a `ValueError` when nested relations are detected. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the same method to handle nested relations differently.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the feature, which is a significant part of the git diff. The git diff includes specific exception handling and logic to check for nested relations, which the RESPONSE does not address. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating other parts of the Django ORM, such as the `FilteredRelation` class and the `Query` class, which are not part of the git diff. While these suggestions may be relevant to the overall implementation of the feature, they do not align with the specific changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code example that is too generic and does not reflect the detailed changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific error messages or the logic for comparing the parts of the lookup with the `relation_name`, which are key elements of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and does not provide the specific guidance needed to implement the feature as shown in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and detailed alignment with the git diff.",
