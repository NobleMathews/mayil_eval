    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed guide on how to implement the 'unified diff' output mode for the `diffsettings` management command in Django, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `add_arguments` method to add the `--output` argument, implement the `output_unified` method, and ensure the `handle` method processes the `--output` argument correctly. The RESPONSE also includes a detailed code snippet that closely aligns with the git diff, particularly in the addition of the `--output` argument and the structure of the `output_unified` method. However, the RESPONSE suggests using the `unified_diff` function from Python's `difflib` module, which is not present in the git diff. While this is a valid alternative approach to generating a unified diff, it does not match the git diff's approach of manually constructing the output. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, which justifies a score of 7.",
