    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with the combination of `Q()` objects and `Exists` subqueries in Django, specifically when negating these conditions. It suggests implementing or checking the `__invert__` method for proper negation handling and reviewing the `Exists` subquery construction. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided, which includes specific changes to the Django codebase to address the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `@deconstructible` decorator placement, the removal of the `identity` property, or the adjustments to the `_combine` method in `query_utils.py`, which are key elements in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff changes, which could lead the developer away from the correct solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general area of the problem but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
