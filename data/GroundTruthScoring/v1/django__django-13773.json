    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps and checks to be performed across various files and classes within the Django framework to address the issue of the migration optimizer crashing when fields are renamed in a circular pattern. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader context of migration optimization and field renaming, it does not provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `reduce` method in `fields.py` to consider both `old_name` and `new_name` in the `references_field` check, which is a targeted fix for the issue described. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader review and potential modifications across multiple files and methods, which is not directly supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific change to the `reduce` method or the consideration of both `old_name` and `new_name`, which is the crux of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks the actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
