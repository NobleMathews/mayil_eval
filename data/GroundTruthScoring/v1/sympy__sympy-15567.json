    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue with the `__divmod__` method in the `Number` class and suggests a fix that is similar to the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to adjust the calculation of `w` to ensure that the sign of the modulus matches the sign of the divisor, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes additional logic to handle cases when `other` is finite and to adjust `w` and `r` if their signs do not match, which is not present in the git diff but does not conflict with the intended fix. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes extra checks and adjustments that are not part of the git diff, but these do not detract from the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for locating the issue but not necessary for the fix itself. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional logic that is not part of the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
