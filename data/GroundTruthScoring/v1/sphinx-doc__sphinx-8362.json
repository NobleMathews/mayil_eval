    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring the use of `functools.update_wrapper` or `functools.wraps` to preserve the original `__init__` method's signature, which is a valid suggestion but does not address the core issue described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that correctly uses `wraps` to preserve the signature, which is good practice but again does not solve the problem at hand.\n\nThe RESPONSE then suggests checking for known bugs or limitations in `sphinx.ext.autodoc` and updating Sphinx or applying a patch if available. This is a reasonable troubleshooting step but does not provide a specific solution.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE advises verifying that the `wrapped` function's signature is not altered in a way that Sphinx's autodoc cannot detect and suggests manually setting the `__signature__` attribute if necessary. This is somewhat relevant but does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `inspect.signature` call in the Sphinx source code to not follow wrapped functions by default and adds a deprecation warning for the `follow_wrapped` parameter.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, which are key to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
