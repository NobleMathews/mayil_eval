    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `my_feature_names` is a list of strings and not an array-like object, which is a relevant and actionable piece of advice. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the call to `export_text` to pass `my_feature_names` as a list, which aligns with the git diff's approach to handling `feature_names` and `class_names` as array-like objects. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of `check_array` to validate `feature_names` and `class_names`, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests avoiding the use of `if my_feature_names:` to check if `my_feature_names` is not `None`, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is a valid point regarding the error described in the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff and provides some actionable advice but is incomplete as it does not cover the changes related to `check_array`.",
