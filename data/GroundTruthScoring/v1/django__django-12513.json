{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a step-by-step guide on how to deprecate the `providing_args` argument from the `Signal` class, which is in line with the git diff provided. It correctly identifies the need to add a deprecation warning, remove the usage of `providing_args`, and update the documentation. The RESPONSE also suggests searching for any usage of `providing_args` in the codebase and removing or updating it, which is a necessary step not explicitly shown in the git diff but implied by the nature of the deprecation.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly reflect the changes made in the git diff, such as the specific warning message used and the exact modifications to the `Signal` class constructor. It also does not mention the removal of `providing_args` from the `Signal` calls throughout the codebase, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is also more verbose than necessary, including a suggestion to reference the issue number in the deprecation warning, which is not present in the git diff. Despite these differences, the RESPONSE is still highly relevant and would assist a developer in addressing the issue, hence the score of 7.",
