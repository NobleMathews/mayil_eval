    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an `aslist` parameter to the `factorint` function to return a list of prime factors including their multiplicities, which aligns with the ISSUE requesting a list format for prime factors. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach, which introduces a `multiple` parameter instead of `aslist`. The RESPONSE's proposed solution is a viable alternative to the git diff, as it achieves the same result of providing a list of prime factors. The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and a code snippet, which is actionable and relevant. However, it does not directly align with the git diff's implementation details, such as the exact parameter name and the specific code changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers actionable advice but is not a direct match to the git diff.",
