    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the field used in `order_by` is included in the select list of both querysets before the `union` operation and using `annotate()` to add the field to each queryset before the union. While this advice is generally sound for avoiding `ProgrammingError` in Django, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the Django ORM's internal handling of `ORDER BY` clauses when the column does not have an alias, by adding the column to the selected columns and adjusting the source expressions accordingly. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Django ORM's internal code or handling cases where the `ORDER BY` column does not have an alias, which is the core of the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general topic of `ORDER BY` clauses and union operations in Django, but it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
