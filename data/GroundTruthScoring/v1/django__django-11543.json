    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff by addressing the issue of connections not being closed properly when the `--nothreading` option is used. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `WSGIRequestHandler` class to set `self.close_connection` to `True` after a request is handled if the server is running without threading, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that connections are closed. However, the git diff shows a different solution, where the `cleanup_headers` method is modified to set the 'Connection' header to 'close' if the server is not an instance of `socketserver.ThreadingMixIn`. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `cleanup_headers` method or the 'Connection' header, which is a key part of the git diff's approach. Therefore, the RESPONSE offers a partial solution that is relevant but does not fully align with the git diff. It provides actionable advice but does not match the git diff's method of resolving the issue.",
