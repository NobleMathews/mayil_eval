{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue described. It suggests adding the missing `get_response_async` method to the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` class, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` inherits properly from `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and `ASGIHandler`, and that the `__call__` method handles asynchronous calls correctly. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises checking for the correct use of `await` and ensuring that `get_response_async` does not return `None`, which aligns with the traceback error described in the issue. The RESPONSE also provides relevant code snippets to check, which would be helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not explicitly mention the use of `sync_to_async` as seen in the git diff, which is a specific implementation detail. However, the RESPONSE's guidance is still highly relevant and would lead the developer to a solution that is effectively the same as the one in the git diff.",
