    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to adding pretty printing functionality for the `lerchphi` function in `sympy`, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests creating a new method following the pattern `_print_<ClassName>` and provides a sample implementation, which is actionable advice. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `lerchphi` function should be added to the `_special_function_classes` method and that a `_print_lerchphi` method should be implemented with a specific `func_name` variable. The RESPONSE does not mention updating the `_special_function_classes` method, nor does it use the `func_name` variable as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary details about the arguments of `lerchphi` and how to create a `prettyForm`, which are not present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the specific changes required. It scores a 4 as it provides some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
