    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the 'autodoc_typehints' setting in the 'conf.py' file, which is relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide any code changes or specific guidance on how to modify the code to prevent type hints from being rendered when 'autodoc_typehints' is set to 'none'. The git diff shows that the code should be modified to check the 'autodoc_typehints' setting before adding type annotations, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests ensuring Sphinx compatibility and potentially reporting the issue to the Sphinx project, which is a reasonable step but does not directly help in resolving the issue through code changes.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue but does not offer specific instructions on what to look for or change within those snippets. This is not as helpful as the git diff, which provides the exact locations and changes needed to fix the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
