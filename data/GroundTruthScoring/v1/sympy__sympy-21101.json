    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `convert` function in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to ensure that `numbersep` is used when two numbers are adjacent in an unevaluated `Mul` expression. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the regular expressions used to detect when two numbers are adjacent. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the exact regular expression patterns that were altered. Instead, it provides a general approach to solving the issue without the precise details that are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests checking if both `last_term_tex` and `term_tex` are numbers, which is not directly reflected in the git diff, as the git diff changes the regular expression for matching to only `[0-9]`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that does not match the git diff and suggests ensuring the regular expressions are correctly defined, which is already done in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue.",
