    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the slice from the queryset in the `Prefetch` object and using a subquery with annotations to limit the number of `Post` objects per `Category`. This is a valid alternative approach to the problem described in the ISSUE, which is about prefetching objects not working with slices. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which introduces a new function `_filter_prefetch_queryset` to handle the slicing within the prefetch operation itself. The RESPONSE's alternative solution is relevant to the issue but does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the Django internals to support slicing in prefetch queries. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets and references to the relevant parts of the Django codebase, which is helpful, but it does not provide a solution that matches the git diff's changes to the `related_descriptors.py` file. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
