    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the aggregate query to use the correct annotated field, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of the QuerySet.aggregate() mixing annotated field names. However, the RESPONSE does not address the underlying problem in the Django code that causes the incorrect SQL query to be generated. The git diff provided shows changes to the Django ORM code to handle cases where an aggregate function is incorrectly referencing an annotated field. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable guidance related to modifying the Django ORM code and instead offers a workaround by changing the query in the user's code. While the workaround might be helpful in some cases, it does not align with the git diff's approach to fixing the issue within the Django framework itself. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
