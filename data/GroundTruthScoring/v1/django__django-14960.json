    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to move the validation logic for `REQUIRED_FIELDS` to a shared method and to ensure that `field.clean(value, None)` is called for each field provided via command-line arguments. This aligns with the git diff's addition of a validation step using `field.clean(user_data[field_name], None)` for the `REQUIRED_FIELDS` passed by command-line in non-interactive mode. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the non-interactive mode else block, which is not directly addressed in the git diff. The git diff specifically adds validation within the existing loop for `REQUIRED_FIELDS` without restructuring the code into a shared method or modifying the non-interactive mode else block. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes handling for many-to-many fields, which is not mentioned in the git diff, but it is a relevant consideration for the overall functionality. The RESPONSE does not directly align with the git diff but offers a partially relevant alternative approach to the issue.",
