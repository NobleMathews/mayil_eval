    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the use of the `--hidden-import` flag with PyInstaller to explicitly include the `chardet` module, which is relevant to the issue of PyInstaller not correctly including the `requests` library's submodules. It also suggests checking the compatibility of the `requests` library with Python 2.7.9 and the installation of the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package if necessary.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `VendorAlias` class to explicitly handle package names and raises an `ImportError` if an attempt is made to import a package that is not listed. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `requests` library code or the `VendorAlias` class, which is a key part of the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the ImportError and provides some steps to potentially resolve it, but it does not match the git diff's solution of modifying the `requests` library's handling of vendored packages. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 4, indicating it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
