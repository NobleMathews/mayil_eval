    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some general advice on how to use Matplotlib backends within a Jupyter notebook context, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the error message in 'backend_bases.py' or the deprecation warning and backend switching logic in 'pyplot.py'. The RESPONSE also suggests avoiding the use of 'plt.ioff()', which is not mentioned in the git diff, and does not provide any actionable guidance on the changes needed to fix the issue described. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and lacks actionable content that would help the developer resolve the issue. The code snippets provided at the end of the RESPONSE are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not offer clear guidance on how to address the issue.",
