    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to modifying the `__repr__` method of the `VOTable` class to change its string representation, which is aligned with the goal of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE suggests creating or modifying a `VOTable` class by extending the `Table` class, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows a modification within the `tree.py` file of the `astropy.io.votable` module, specifically altering the `__repr__` method of an existing class to prepend \"<VO\" to the string representation of the table. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the existing `__repr__` method and instead suggests a broader class-level change. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not aligned with the git diff, as it suggests returning a formatted string with `self.length`, which is not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for reference, which could be helpful for locating the relevant sections of code, but it does not directly assist in implementing the specific change required. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
