    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, offering actionable advice that is relevant and effective.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE explains the purpose of the problematic line in the original code, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It acknowledges that the line in question may cause incorrect behavior for non-commutative objects whose free symbols are commutative, which is the core of the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or actionable advice on how to modify the code to fix the issue. It only suggests that modifications might be needed, without detailing what those modifications could be.\n\nThe GIT DIFF, on the other hand, shows a specific change where the conditional block that checks if all free symbols are commutative and then appends a Dummy object is removed. This directly addresses the ISSUE by ensuring that non-commutative objects are not treated as commutative, regardless of their free symbols. The RESPONSE does not align with this solution, as it does not suggest removing or altering the code block in question.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It acknowledges the problem but does not guide the developer towards the solution shown in the git diff. This warrants a score of 4, as it is incomplete and only partially relevant.",
