{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the file and class where the issue resides, which is `KeyboardTransform` in `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py`. It accurately points out that the `run` method is responsible for the incorrect rendering of multi-word keys like \"Caps Lock\" into nested `<kbd>` tags. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the `is_multiwords_key` method should be used to check for multi-word keys and that the `run` method needs to be modified to handle these keys correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a code snippet with modifications to the `run` method, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `[:2]` instead of `[:3]` and `parts = parts[3:]` instead of `parts[:3] = []`, which is not exactly the same as the git diff but aims to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code snippet, which is helpful for the developer.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the addition of the `multiwords_keys` tuple or the `is_multiwords_key` method, which are present in the git diff. These omissions are significant because they are part of the logic needed to identify multi-word keys. However, the RESPONSE does mention the need to ensure that `is_multiwords_key` correctly identifies multi-word keys, which indicates an awareness of the need for such a method, even though it does not provide the implementation details.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It provides a solution that achieves similar results, even though it does not include all the elements of the git diff's approach. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
