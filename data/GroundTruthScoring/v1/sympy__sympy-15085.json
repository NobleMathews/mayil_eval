    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking imports and ensuring that 'Matrix' is accessible in the scope where it's being used. It also suggests ensuring that the 'modules' parameter in 'lambdify' includes 'sympy' or a mapping for 'Matrix'. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by adding a new setting 'allow_unknown_functions' to various printers in the SymPy library and modifying the '_print_Function' method to handle unknown functions. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, nor does it offer a viable alternative solution. It does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, which involve updates to the internal code of the SymPy library, not user code. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
