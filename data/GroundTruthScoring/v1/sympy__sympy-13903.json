    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating a function called `convert_function_name` to include mappings for Octave and Fortran, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows direct modifications to the `fcode.py` and `octave.py` files to add support for the `Max` and `Min` functions, rather than modifying a conversion function. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to the function `mini` instead of `Min`, which does not match the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach, which is to directly add the mappings in the respective files. However, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need to handle `max` and `min` functions for Octave and Fortran, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
