    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the anchor generation logic in `sphinx/domains/python.py` to replace dashes with underscores or adjust the logic to match the new expected behavior. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to `sphinx/domains/python.py`. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to `sphinx/builders/_epub_base.py` and `sphinx/util/nodes.py`, which involve updating the ID fixing logic and the regular expression for non-ID characters. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in these files and instead focuses on a different file and approach that is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE also mentions `nbsphinx` link handling, which is not part of the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability in the context of the git diff.",
