    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a complex solution involving the creation of a new field type with a 'wrapped_fields' attribute and modifications to the 'save' method to handle non-concrete fields. While this approach could theoretically address the issue, it is significantly more complex than the changes shown in the git diff. The git diff simply changes the fields checked from 'self._meta.fields' to 'self._meta.concrete_fields' and updates the error message to include non-concrete fields. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's simpler and more direct approach to the problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding validation in the model's 'clean' method or a pre-save signal, which is not mentioned in the git diff and adds unnecessary complexity. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and introduces additional steps that are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored low for not aligning with the git diff and for suggesting a more complicated solution than necessary.",
