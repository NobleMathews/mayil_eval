    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `latex` function not maintaining the same monomial order as the `pretty` and `str` functions when printing polynomials. It suggests modifying the `_print_Poly` method to sort the terms by the total degree of the monomials in descending order, which is a relevant and necessary step to resolve the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the detailed implementation that is present in the git diff, such as handling the coefficients and monomials, dealing with the signs, and constructing the final string. The RESPONSE's suggestion to sort the terms is a step in the right direction, but it lacks the complete logic and code changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not offer a complete solution to the issue. It provides actionable advice but is incomplete in terms of the detailed changes required, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
