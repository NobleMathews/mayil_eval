    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff suggests a change in the _protect_dataset_variables_inplace function, specifically modifying the condition to check if the variable name is not in dataset._indexes instead of not in variable.dims. This change is intended to prevent an error when the dataset contains a multiindex. The RESPONSE, however, suggests encoding and decoding the MultiIndex and modifying the open_dataset method, which is not related to the actual change needed as per the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would resolve the issue described in the ISSUE section. The RESPONSE does mention the possibility of modifying the backend to handle multiindices, but it does not provide a clear or correct path to do so. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses handling multiindices, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, thus it receives a score of 1.",
