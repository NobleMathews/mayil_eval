    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `ServerHandler.finish_response` and `cleanup_headers` methods, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE advises setting `Content-Length` to '0' for HEAD requests, which contradicts the git diff. The git diff shows that the `Content-Length` header should be deleted for HEAD requests, not set to '0'. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the use of `deque` to consume the iterator without sending a body, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the need to ensure no body is sent for HEAD requests and to modify the `finish_response` method, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach.",
