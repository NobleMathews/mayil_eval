    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the output of `calibrator.predict` is a 1-dimensional NumPy array rather than a Pandas DataFrame or a 2-dimensional NumPy array. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff shows that the `transform` method in `IsotonicRegression` was refactored to separate the transformation logic into a new `_transform` method, which is then called by both `transform` and `predict`. This ensures that the output types are consistent and avoids the issue caused by `set_config(transform_output=\"pandas\")`. The RESPONSE does not address this refactoring or the underlying cause of the issue. Instead, it provides a workaround that might not be effective in all cases, as it does not address the root cause of the problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not offer a solution that aligns with the git diff.",
