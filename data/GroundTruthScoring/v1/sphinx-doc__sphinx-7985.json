    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new function `check_local_link` to handle the checking of local links and modifying the `check` function to call this new function when a local link is detected. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which introduces logic to handle local links within the existing `check` function. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of using a regular expression to differentiate between supported and unsupported URI schemes and then checking for the existence of local files or directories. Instead, it suggests a separate function for local links, which is a reasonable alternative but not as closely aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE also mentions updating the `process_result` function and adding unit tests, which are good practices but not directly related to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE provides actionable advice and a partial solution, but it does not fully match the git diff's approach or provide a complete alternative solution. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant.",
