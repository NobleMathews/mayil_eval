    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `constrained_layout=False` parameter and using `plt.tight_layout()` or suppressing the warning if it's not critical. However, this does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `__init__` method of a figure to handle the `constrained_layout` parameter correctly. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the library code but rather provides workarounds for the user. While the suggestion to suppress the warning might be a temporary fix, it does not solve the problem at its root, as the git diff does. The RESPONSE also suggests checking code snippets for understanding, which is not directly helpful in fixing the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the problem with `constrained_layout` and `plt.subplots_adjust`, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
