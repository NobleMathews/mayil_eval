    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided is highly relevant to the issue and aligns closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to add a `__reversed__` method to the `OrderedSet` class within the `django/utils/datastructures.py` file, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also provides a clear implementation of the `__reversed__` method, which is similar to the git diff's solution, and includes an example of a test case to verify the functionality.\n\nThe only minor difference is that the RESPONSE suggests using `reversed(list(self.dict))` to create the reverse iterator, while the git diff directly uses `reversed(self.dict)`. This difference does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE, as both approaches will achieve the desired outcome of making the `OrderedSet` reversible. The RESPONSE's suggestion to convert the dictionary keys to a list before reversing is a valid alternative, although it is slightly less efficient than the git diff's direct approach.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable, relevant guidance that would enable a developer to implement the feature and fix the issue effectively. Therefore, it receives a score of 9.",
