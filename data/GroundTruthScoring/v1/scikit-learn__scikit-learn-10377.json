    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of checks and potential modifications to address the issue with the f1_score function when the labels parameter includes label 0. It suggests verifying the handling of the `labels` parameter, ensuring correct calculation of the macro average, checking for conditional mishandling of label 0, and testing the changes with relevant data.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in that it identifies the need to address the handling of the `labels` parameter within the f1_score function. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific code change or patch, unlike the git diff, which adds a conditional check to ensure that `n_labels` is not None before slicing `y_true` and `y_pred`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to review the handling of the `zero_division` parameter is not directly related to the git diff, which does not mention or address `zero_division`.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the area of the code that needs attention (the handling of the `labels` parameter) and provides a general direction for the developer to investigate and potentially fix the issue. However, it lacks the actionable detail provided in the git diff, which offers a precise code change. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of providing a specific solution.",
