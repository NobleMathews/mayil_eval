    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the issue described. The git diff shows a change in the _pytest/nodes.py file to address the problem of displaying incorrect paths when the working directory is changed during a test. The RESPONSE, however, suggests reviewing and modifying the test suite and fixture, which is unrelated to the actual fix required. It also provides irrelevant links to various parts of the repository that have no connection to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE fails to address the core problem of the path display and does not offer any actionable advice that would lead to a resolution similar to the one in the git diff.",
