    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is the inability of Requests 2.5.1 to recognize unicode filenames for uploads under Python 2. The RESPONSE suggests updating the `is_valid_filename` function to check against `basestring` instead of `builtin_str`, which aligns with the git diff's approach of modifying the `guess_filename` function to use `basestring`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure `is_py2` is imported from `requests/compat.py`, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of `basestring` to the import list in `requests/utils.py`. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests creating a new function `is_valid_filename`, which is not present in the git diff. However, the core idea of using `basestring` for Python 2 compatibility is the same, and the RESPONSE's alternative approach would achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
