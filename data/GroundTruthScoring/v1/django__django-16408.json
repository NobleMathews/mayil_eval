    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking model relationships, the use of `FilteredRelation` and `select_related`, and the correctness of the assertion in the test case. However, it does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to the setting of the wrong related object when using multi-level `FilteredRelation` with `select_related()`. The git diff provided shows a modification in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, where a new function `local_setter_noop` is introduced and used conditionally to prevent setting the cached value when the number of joins exceeds two. The RESPONSE fails to mention or address this specific change or the logic behind it. Instead, it provides general advice on checking model relationships and query methods, which does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses related objects and `select_related`, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
