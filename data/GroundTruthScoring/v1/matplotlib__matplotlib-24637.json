    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying and potentially implementing `set_gid` and `get_gid` methods, modifying the SVG backend, and reviewing the pull request for a similar issue. However, the git diff indicates that the solution involves adding `renderer.open_group` and `renderer.close_group` calls with the appropriate `gid` in the `draw` method of the `AnnotationBbox` class. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach at all. Instead, it suggests changes to the SVG backend, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify that the issue is related to the `gid` not being included in the SVG output, but the steps it suggests are not aligned with the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the same issue, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff and therefore does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
