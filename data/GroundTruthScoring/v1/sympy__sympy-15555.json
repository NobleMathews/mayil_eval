    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `primepi` function is designed to handle symbolic arguments and provides two alternative solutions. The first solution is to return a `NotImplementedError` if a symbolic argument is passed, which does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying `primepi` to handle symbolic arguments correctly. The second solution suggests implementing symbolic handling logic, which is more aligned with the git diff but does not provide specific details on how to implement this, unlike the git diff which converts `primepi` into a class that inherits from `Function` and adds an `eval` method to handle different cases, including symbolic arguments.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It does not mention converting `primepi` into a class or implementing an `eval` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests returning a `NotImplementedError` for symbolic arguments, which is contrary to the git diff's solution of properly handling such cases. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the need for symbolic argument handling but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
