    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_latex` method in the `CG` class to wrap the LaTeX string representation in braces when it is raised to a power. This suggestion is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about the LaTeX representation of the `CG` object not rendering correctly when squared. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which adds a `precedence` attribute and modifies the mathematical notation in the documentation, rather than changing the `_latex` method or the `__pow__` method as suggested by the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that the `__pow__` method handles the LaTeX representation correctly is not supported by the git diff, which does not mention or modify the `__pow__` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the documentation and the addition of the `PRECEDENCE` import, which are key to resolving the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice regarding LaTeX representation but fails to align closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. It does not address the changes made in the git diff and instead suggests an alternative that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2.",
