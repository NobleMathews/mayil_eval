    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests converting a `MozillaCookieJar` to a `RequestsCookieJar` using a dictionary comprehension and the `cookiejar_from_dict` function. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it addresses the compatibility problem between `MozillaCookieJar` and the `requests` library. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which introduces a new `merge_cookies` function to handle the merging of cookies into a `CookieJar` object, and updates the `sessions.py` to use this new function. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's method of resolving the issue. Instead, it suggests a workaround that does not reflect the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE is also missing the context that the issue is a regression in the `requests` library, which the git diff aims to fix by updating the library's code. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
