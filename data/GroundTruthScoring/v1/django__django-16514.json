    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `AdminSite.filter_log_entries` method to filter `LogEntry` objects based on the models registered with the `AdminSite` instance and the user's permissions. It also suggests using `get_registered_models`, `LogEntry.get_for_model`, and permission checks to achieve this. However, the git diff provided does not show any changes to a method named `filter_log_entries` or the use of `get_registered_models` or `LogEntry.get_for_model`. Instead, the git diff adds a new method `get_log_entries` to the `AdminSite` class and modifies the `render` method in the `log.py` template tag to use a new context variable `log_entries`.\n\nThe RESPONSE's approach is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to filter log entries based on registered models and permissions, which aligns with the intent of the issue. However, it does not provide actionable content that matches the git diff's approach of adding a new method and modifying the template tag logic. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for understanding the context but does not directly aid in implementing the solution as per the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and does not provide clear guidance on how to implement the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
