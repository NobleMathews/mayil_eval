{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff, providing clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general strategy for resolving the issue with the `decompogen` function when handling `Min` and `Max`, which is the core problem described in the ISSUE. It suggests checking for infinite recursion and implementing a base case for `Min` and `Max` to prevent further recursive calls, which is aligned with the git diff that adds special handling for `Min` and `Max` functions. The RESPONSE also advises ensuring that `Min` and `Max` are decomposed into their arguments correctly and that each argument is processed individually, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of decomposing these functions into their arguments and handling them separately. Additionally, the RESPONSE recommends testing the changes with expressions containing `Min` and `Max`, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed implementation steps, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not match the git diff in terms of specificity and completeness of the solution. This justifies a score of 7.",
