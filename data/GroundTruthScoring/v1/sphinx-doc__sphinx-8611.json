    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a docstring for the `staticMetaObject` attribute in the `Reenter` class to satisfy Sphinx's documentation requirements. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the Sphinx extension to handle non-data descriptors more appropriately. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the Sphinx extension but rather suggests a workaround that involves modifying the user's code, which is not the focus of the issue. The RESPONSE does mention looking into the Sphinx codebase, which is somewhat relevant, but it does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to a solution similar to the one in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not effective in assisting the developer to fix the issue as described and as resolved in the git diff. The score is set to 1 because the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant by acknowledging the need to address Sphinx's handling of documentation but fails to provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
