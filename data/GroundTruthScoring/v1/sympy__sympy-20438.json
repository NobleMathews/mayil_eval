    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an 'equals' method to the 'Complement' class to fix the issue with 'is_subset' giving wrong results. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the 'Complement' class or the addition of an 'equals' method. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the '_eval_simplify' method in 'sympy/core/relational.py' to handle cases where the left-hand side (lhs) or right-hand side (rhs) of an equation is not an instance of 'Expr'. It also modifies the '_eval_is_eq' method in 'sympy/sets/handlers/comparison.py' and adds a new dispatch for 'ProductSet' and 'FiniteSet' in 'sympy/sets/handlers/issubset.py'.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the changes shown in the git diff and instead provides an unrelated solution. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help the developer in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.",
