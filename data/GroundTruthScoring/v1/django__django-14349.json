    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `URLValidator` class to handle URLs ending with newline characters, which is relevant to the issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to include newline characters in the `unsafe_chars` set, which aligns with the git diff that adds `unsafe_chars = frozenset('\\t\\r\\n')`. However, the RESPONSE suggests stripping newline characters from the end of the URL before validation, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff instead proposes to raise a `ValidationError` if any unsafe characters are found in the URL, without stripping them. The RESPONSE's suggestion to strip the characters is a valid alternative approach to handling the issue, but it does not match the git diff's approach of raising an error when unsafe characters are present. The RESPONSE also provides additional value by suggesting the addition of a test case to ensure proper validation, which is not included in the git diff but is a good practice. The RESPONSE does not directly align with the git diff in terms of the exact solution but offers a viable alternative and additional useful advice.",
