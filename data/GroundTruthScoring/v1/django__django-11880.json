{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__deepcopy__` method to perform a deep copy of the `error_messages` dictionary, which aligns with the issue description that states the need for a deep copy of this dictionary to prevent shared references between form field instances. The RESPONSE's proposed code change is to use `copy.deepcopy(self.error_messages, memo)` instead of a shallow copy. This is a viable alternative to the git diff, which uses `self.error_messages.copy()`. The RESPONSE's solution would indeed create a deep copy of the error messages, ensuring that modifications to one instance's error messages do not affect another. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, but it offers a valid and effective alternative solution to the problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the codebase, which is helpful for locating the issue. However, it does not score a perfect 10 because it suggests a deep copy where the git diff suggests a shallow copy, which is a different approach, albeit still a valid one.",
