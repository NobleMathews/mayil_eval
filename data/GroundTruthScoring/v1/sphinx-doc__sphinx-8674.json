    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a high-level approach to enable passing options to Pygments, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows specific changes to the `sphinx/config.py`, `sphinx/writers/html.py`, `sphinx/writers/html5.py`, and `sphinx/writers/latex.py` files, which involve modifying the handling of `highlight_options` to support a dictionary mapping language names to options and updating the `visit_literal_block` method in the writer files to use these options. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying different files (`sphinx/directives/code.py` and `sphinx/highlighting.py`) and adding a new configuration option `pygments_options`, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a detailed breakdown and code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader goal of passing options to Pygments, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
