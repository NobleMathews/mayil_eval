    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and be relevant given the issue and the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing 'ordering = ['option__pk']' with a valid field name and provides general guidance on how to correct the 'Meta.ordering' configuration. However, it does not address the specific issue of handling 'pk' in the 'ordering' of a related field as described in the git diff. The git diff shows a modification in the code to handle 'pk' specifically by checking if the part is 'pk' and then assigning the primary key field to 'fld'. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the code to handle 'pk' but instead suggests avoiding the use of 'pk' in 'ordering' and replacing it with another field. This does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly actionable and do not contribute to resolving the issue as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
