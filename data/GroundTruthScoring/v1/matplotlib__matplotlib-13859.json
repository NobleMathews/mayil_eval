    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of zero-width figures crashing libpng by suggesting code modifications to ensure that the figure size is non-zero before saving. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the matplotlib code to raise a ValueError if the figure size is not positive and finite. The RESPONSE's suggestion to raise a ValueError if the dimensions are zero is consistent with the git diff's approach to raise an error for invalid figure sizes. Additionally, the RESPONSE offers an alternative solution by setting a minimum size, which is a valid and effective approach, although it is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly modify the matplotlib library code as the git diff does, but it provides guidance that would prevent the error from occurring, which is the ultimate goal. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, which could be helpful for further investigation, although this is not directly related to the git diff's changes.",
