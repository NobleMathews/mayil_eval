    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable guide that closely aligns with the git diff. It offers a clear explanation of the steps needed to implement support for the \"Receives\" section in the Sphinx Napoleon extension, which is the issue at hand. The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method to parse the \"Receives\" section and updating the parsing logic, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff but provides a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the `NumpyDocstring` class to recognize and parse the \"Receives\" section, which is consistent with the git diff. It also correctly suggests that the parsed \"Receives\" section should be formatted correctly and included in the generated documentation, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the `_parse_receives_section` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes as seen in the git diff, but it does offer a high-level overview and pseudo-code that would lead to a similar outcome. The RESPONSE also correctly notes the need for unit tests and documentation updates, which are important for maintaining the quality of the extension but are not explicitly mentioned in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE could have been more aligned with the git diff if it had mentioned the specific method names and the exact parsing logic used in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is still valid and relevant, and it provides a comprehensive guide that would help a developer address the issue effectively.",
