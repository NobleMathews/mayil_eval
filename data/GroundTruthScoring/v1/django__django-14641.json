    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to move the special-case logic from `BoundField.initial()` to `BaseForm.get_initial_for_field()`, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the location of the logic to be moved and the condition under which it should be executed (under the `if callable(value)` block). Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests running the test suite to check for regressions and considers the possibility of further refactoring by moving logic to a new method in the `Field` class, which aligns with the issue's suggestion for a future improvement. The RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the removal of the `import datetime` statement from `boundfield.py` as shown in the git diff, which is a minor detail but part of the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
