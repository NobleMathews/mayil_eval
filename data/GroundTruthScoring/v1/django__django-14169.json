    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and precise instructions that directly align with the git diff. It correctly identifies the file and method to be modified (`django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py` and `get_test_db_clone_settings` respectively). The RESPONSE then provides the exact code change needed to fix the issue, which matches the git diff solution of changing the string format from `'{}_{}.{}'.format(root, suffix, ext)` to `'{}_{}{}'.format(root, suffix, ext)`. This change effectively removes the extra dot from the cloned test database file names, addressing the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a reminder to ensure that there is no extra dot before the file extension, which is a helpful note for the developer implementing the fix. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the relevant code snippet, which is useful for quick reference. Overall, the RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and provides actionable, relevant guidance to resolve the issue.",
