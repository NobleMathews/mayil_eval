    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on how to resolve issues with missing reference targets in Sphinx documentation, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, it does not align with the git diff provided, which adds a __hash__ and __repr__ method to a class, suggesting that the issue might be related to the hashing and representation of certain objects in Sphinx's internal processing.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests checking imports, intersphinx mappings, module paths, and suppressing warnings, which are all valid troubleshooting steps for the described problem. However, it does not provide any actionable guidance that directly relates to the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to various parts of the Sphinx codebase, which could be helpful for understanding the underlying mechanisms but do not offer a direct solution to the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to address the specific changes in the git diff, which seem to be focused on ensuring that certain objects can be hashed and represented correctly, likely for the purpose of resolving references. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
