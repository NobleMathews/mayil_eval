    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting updates to the `binomial` function to handle negative `k` values correctly. It aligns with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of the `binomial` function not following the documented behavior for negative `k`. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `eval` method to return `0` when `k` is negative, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to handling negative `k` values.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE introduces additional conditions and checks that are not present in the git diff, such as `((n_nonneg or n_isint is False) and d.is_zero)` and `((n_nonneg or n_isint is False) and (d - 1).is_zero)`. These changes are not necessary to resolve the issue and complicate the solution. The RESPONSE also includes a snippet to handle the case when `n` is not a number, which is not addressed in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the documentation, which is not part of the git diff solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly align with the git diff's simplification of the conditionals and the removal of the variable `d`. It also does not address the special case for `n.is_negative and n.is_integer` as the git diff does. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers some actionable advice, it is not fully aligned with the git diff and includes unnecessary changes.",
