    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as a case sensitivity mismatch between Django's migration system and the MySQL database configuration. It provides a clear explanation of the problem and suggests a solution that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE advises modifying the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file to handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables and columns, which is what the git diff does. It also correctly suggests using the `.casefold()` method for case-insensitive comparison, which is present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `fold_identifier_case` variable and the specific changes to the `should_skip_detecting_model` function. Instead, it provides a general direction to adjust the logic for case sensitivity. The RESPONSE also includes additional advice on re-running migrations without the `--fake-initial` flag, which is not directly related to the code changes in the git diff but is relevant to the issue at hand. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it lacks the precise details of the implementation, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
