    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the issue is related to the `exp` function being used with a dimensioned quantity and that the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` function is responsible for collecting the scale factor and dimension of an expression. It also correctly suggests that the `SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless` method should be used to check if the dimension of an expression is dimensionless.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` method to handle dimensionless expressions correctly by introducing a check for dimensionless dimensions and returning `Dimension(1)` when appropriate. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests raising an error or handling the expression to ensure it is dimensionless before passing it to `exp`, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue but does not offer a clear solution or modification to the code as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
