    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `get_session_auth_hash` method to use `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` and modifying the `update_session_auth_hash` function to handle a tuple of hashes. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also involves changes to the `get_session_auth_hash` method and related session verification logic. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made. The git diff introduces a new method `get_session_auth_fallback_hash` and modifies the session verification logic to use fallback hashes, while the RESPONSE suggests returning a tuple of hashes from `get_session_auth_hash` and updating `update_session_auth_hash` to handle this tuple, which is not present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant because it addresses the need to use `SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS` for session authentication, which is the core issue. However, it does not provide a complete or accurate solution compared to the git diff. The RESPONSE's approach to modifying `update_session_auth_hash` is not supported by the git diff, which instead focuses on the session verification process within `get_user` and does not involve changes to `update_session_auth_hash`. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to store fallback hashes in the session is not reflected in the git diff and may introduce unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is related to the issue but does not closely match the git diff's approach. It offers a different solution that is not as effective or relevant as the changes shown in the git diff.",
