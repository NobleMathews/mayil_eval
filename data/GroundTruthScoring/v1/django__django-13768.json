{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of logging exceptions in Signal.send_robust(). It correctly suggests importing the logging module, defining a logger for the dispatcher module, and adding a logging call in the exception handling block of the send_robust method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to log exceptions and provides a code snippet that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying a method called _log_robust_failure and ensuring it is called in the exception blocks of send_robust and asend_robust methods, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff directly adds a logging call within the exception block of send_robust without creating a separate method. Additionally, the RESPONSE mentions the asend_robust method, which is not part of the git diff, but it is a relevant consideration for a complete solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 as it is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but includes additional steps not present in the git diff.",
