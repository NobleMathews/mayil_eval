    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method `get_legend_handles()` and documenting the `legendHandles` attribute in the `Legend` class. However, the git diff indicates that the attribute `legendHandles` has been renamed to `legend_handles` and that a deprecation decorator has been added to the old attribute name to maintain backward compatibility. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests adding a new method that is not present in the diff and fails to recognize the renaming and deprecation of the old attribute. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the documentation updates made in the git diff, such as the addition of the 'Attributes' section and the versionadded directive. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
