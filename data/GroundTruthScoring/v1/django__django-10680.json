{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to refactor the AutoField logic into a mixin and implement checks and validators, which is the essence of the issue. It suggests creating an AutoFieldMixin, moving specific logic from AutoField and BigAutoField to the mixin, and ensuring that these classes inherit from IntegerField and BigIntegerField respectively. The RESPONSE also mentions implementing the missing checks and validators, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the changes in code, which is helpful for understanding the structure of the solution. It also correctly identifies that AutoField and BigAutoField should inherit from their respective integer field types and the new mixin, which is in line with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result. It emphasizes the need for backward compatibility and thorough testing, which are important considerations for the issue at hand.\n\nThe only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not provide the exact code changes as shown in the git diff, but it does offer a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
