    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely match or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and suggests modifications to the `evaluate_candidates` function in `_search.py` to prevent storing fitted estimators in `cv_results_['params']`. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the same function to ensure that a cloned estimator is used instead of the original one. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to clone the base estimator before fitting it with parameters, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of cloning parameters in `_validation.py`.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `best_estimator_` is a clone of the base estimator with the best parameters applied, which is in line with the git diff's change to clone the base estimator again after setting parameters. Additionally, the RESPONSE's recommendation to test the changes with `n_jobs=1` is relevant to the issue, as the problem occurs when `n_jobs=1`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to cloning parameters in `_validation.py` as shown in the git diff, which is an important part of the solution. It also includes a section on checking code snippets with links that are not actionable within the context of the RESPONSE and do not directly contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match to the git diff but provides a closely aligned and actionable solution.",
