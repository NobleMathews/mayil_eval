{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `get_prep_value` method in the `IntegerField`, `FloatField`, and `AutoField` classes to handle invalid types more gracefully and provide a more informative error message that includes the field name, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes example code that is very similar to the git diff, demonstrating an understanding of the issue and how to resolve it.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the `OuterRef` case handled in the git diff, which is a minor omission but does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, making it very useful for the developer to fix the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
