    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the GitHub Actions workflow to include a new version of `docutils` and ensuring that the test suite includes a test case for `docutils-0.17b1` compatibility. However, the git diff provided shows changes to the Sphinx codebase, specifically in handling titles within the toctree in HTML writers. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes needed to fix the issue, nor does it provide any guidance related to the modifications shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue as it does not align with the git diff nor does it offer a viable alternative approach.",
