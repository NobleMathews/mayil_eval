    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changes to the `BaseForm._clean_fields` method and the `changed_data` property, as well as the addition of a `has_changed` method to the `BoundField` class. However, the RESPONSE does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `_clean_fields` method should use `bf.data` and `bf.initial` directly from the `BoundField` object, while the RESPONSE suggests using `self.get_initial_for_field(field, name)` which is not in line with the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly states that `bf._has_changed()` does not exist and suggests using `bf.has_changed()` instead, but the git diff actually introduces a new `_has_changed` method within the `BoundField` class, which is meant to be used. The RESPONSE does not reflect the changes made in the git diff to the `_html_output` method and the removal of the `_field_data_value` method, which are part of the issue's request to access values through `BoundField` objects for consistency. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results, and it introduces suggestions that are not supported by the git diff, such as using `self.get_initial_for_field(field, name)` instead of `bf.initial`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
