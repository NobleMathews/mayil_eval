    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reintroducing the `--strict` option and updating related components, which is partially in line with the git diff that reintroduces the `--strict` option as an alias to `--strict-markers`. However, the RESPONSE fails to mention the deprecation warning that should be issued when the `--strict` option is used, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a checklist of actions that are not directly related to the git diff, such as updating tests or features affected by the `--strict` option, and recording the reintroduction in version control or changelog. While these actions might be part of a general good practice, they do not align with the specific changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references a code snippet related to a pre-commit hook configuration for the 'py' library, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
