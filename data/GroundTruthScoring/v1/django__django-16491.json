    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests setting the `empty_result_set_value` to `False` in the `Exists` class, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE recommends ensuring that `output_field` is set to `BooleanField(null=False)`, which, while not explicitly mentioned in the git diff, is a reasonable suggestion to ensure that `None` values are not returned. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `as_sql` method and potentially using a `CASE WHEN` statement to ensure a boolean value is returned. These suggestions go beyond the git diff but are relevant and could be considered as additional safeguards to ensure the correct behavior. The RESPONSE loses some points for not being a direct match to the git diff in terms of the `as_sql` method and `CASE WHEN` statement, which are not part of the git diff, but these are still valuable suggestions that could improve the robustness of the solution.",
