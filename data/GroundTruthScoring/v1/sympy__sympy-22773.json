    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the line '_print_Determinant = _print_Abs' from the LatexPrinter class, which is aligned with the git diff that also removes this line. Additionally, the RESPONSE proposes an implementation of a new '_print_Determinant' method. This method is similar to the one in the git diff, with the main difference being that the git diff includes additional logic to handle BlockMatrix instances and uses '_print_matrix_contents' instead of directly calling '_print'. The RESPONSE's solution is a simplified version that does not account for BlockMatrix instances, but it still addresses the core issue of the incorrect LaTeX display of a determinant. The RESPONSE does not include the changes to the pretty printer found in the git diff, but since the main issue is related to the LaTeX display, the RESPONSE is still highly relevant and offers a viable solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE receives a high score for its relevance and alignment with the git diff, despite minor differences and omissions.",
