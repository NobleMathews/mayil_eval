    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_module_members` and `get_all_members` functions in `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py` to ensure that all members are considered, regardless of their presence in `__all__`. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`. Instead, the git diff introduces a new class `ObjectMember` and modifies the `get_object_members` and `filter_members` methods in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to handle the issue described. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue. Therefore, it does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
