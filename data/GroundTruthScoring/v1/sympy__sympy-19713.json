    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to resolving the issue by suggesting the use of the `FracField` class to create a fraction field and then create a field element. However, it does not align closely with the git diff, which includes specific changes to the `field_new` method in the `fields.py` file to handle different instances and conversions properly. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes needed in the codebase to fix the issue, such as handling the conversion when the domain is a `FractionField` or a `PolynomialRing`. Instead, it suggests an alternative way to create a field element, which does not directly address the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the actionable changes needed according to the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the creation of field elements, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff.",
