    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of the `refresh_from_db` method not clearing cached generic foreign keys. It suggests modifying the `refresh_from_db` method in the `User` model to loop through `self._meta.private_fields` and clear the cache for each `GenericForeignKey` field found. This approach is highly relevant and aligns closely with the git diff, which also adds a loop through `self._meta.private_fields` to clear cached private relations. The RESPONSE's use of `isinstance(field, GenericForeignKey)` is a reasonable alternative to the git diff's `field.is_relation` check, as it specifically targets `GenericForeignKey` fields. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests checking for `GenericForeignKey` specifically, while the git diff checks for any relation. However, this does not detract from the effectiveness of the RESPONSE, as it still addresses the core issue and provides a viable solution. The RESPONSE also includes references to code snippets that could help understand the issue further, which adds value to the developer looking to fix the issue.",
