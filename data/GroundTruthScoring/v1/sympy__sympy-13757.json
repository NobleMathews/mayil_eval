    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the multiplication operation involving `Poly` objects and integers or `S` objects and points to the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods in the `Poly` class as potential sources of the problem. It also suggests checking the `S` function or class in `sympy/core` for symbolic representation issues. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix was to add an `_op_priority` attribute to the `Poly` class to ensure that the multiplication operation is handled correctly by the Python interpreter's method resolution order (MRO).\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention or suggest modifying the `_op_priority` attribute, which is the key change in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on reviewing and potentially modifying the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` methods, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach. While the RESPONSE's suggestions could lead to a review of the relevant multiplication methods, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it correctly identifies the multiplication operation as the issue and points to the `Poly` class. However, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
