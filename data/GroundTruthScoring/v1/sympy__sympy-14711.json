    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `__add__` method to handle the case when `other` is an integer zero, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a condition to return `self` if `other` equals 0. This part of the RESPONSE is directly in line with the git diff and addresses the TypeError encountered when attempting to add a zero vector.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE also includes an additional suggestion to update the `Vector` constructor to handle integer zero input by initializing an empty list for `self.args`. This part of the RESPONSE is not reflected in the git diff and is not necessary to resolve the issue described. The git diff does not modify the constructor, and the issue can be resolved without changing how the `Vector` class is instantiated.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a check for both `int` and `float` types, which is more general than the git diff but still relevant and does not conflict with the solution. The inclusion of code snippets to check is helpful for locating the relevant sections of the code but does not directly contribute to solving the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff, with an additional unnecessary change to the constructor. Therefore, it scores a 7 as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, but includes an extra modification that is not supported by the git diff.",
