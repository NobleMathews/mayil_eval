    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting updates to the `remove` method in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` and the `cla()` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`. The advice to unset the `.axes` attribute in the `cla()` method aligns with the git diff, which also includes code to unset the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes of deparented artists when clearing the axes. However, the RESPONSE suggests an additional change to the `remove` method that is not present in the git diff. While this change could be relevant to the broader issue of artist removal, it is not part of the specific solution provided in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention setting the `.figure` attribute to `None`, which is included in the git diff and is relevant to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the issue as described.",
