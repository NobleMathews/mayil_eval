    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `MultiCursor` class to address the issue with the multicursor disappearing and the high CPU usage when `useblit=False` on the `nbagg` backend. It proposes adding a timer to force a redraw of the multicursor and implementing additional event handlers. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need to modify the `MultiCursor` class, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows changes to the event handler method names, the addition of deprecation decorators, and conditional visibility updates for the cursor lines, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion of adding a timer and new event handlers is not supported by the git diff and does not reflect the changes made by the expert fixer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It receives a score of 2 because it recognizes the need to modify the `MultiCursor` class but fails to provide guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution.",
