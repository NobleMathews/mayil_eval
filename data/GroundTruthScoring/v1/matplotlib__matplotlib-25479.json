    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests verifying the colormap registration and consistency in naming, which is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not address the specific problem of the colormap object retaining its original name after registration with a new name. The git diff shows that the issue is resolved by adding code to update the colormap's name attribute if it does not match the registered name. The RESPONSE fails to mention this critical aspect of the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking for typos and ensuring global registration, which are general troubleshooting steps not directly related to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not actionable or specific enough to help resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 1 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
