    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding Python 3.7 to the Travis CI configuration, which is not related to the actual code changes needed to fix the issue. It also suggests checking for incorrect usage of the `factorial` function and ensuring that the `__new__` method is provided with the required 'expr' argument, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as importing `NEWLINE` and modifying the conditions in `_implicit_application` and `lambda_notation` functions to handle the `NEWLINE` token correctly. The RESPONSE does mention ensuring that `parse_expr` is called with the correct transformations, which is somewhat related to the issue, but it does not provide specific actionable guidance on how to implement the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
