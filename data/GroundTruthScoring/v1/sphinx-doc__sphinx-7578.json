    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and be relevant in the context of the software system.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `NameFinder` class or function exists and updating references if it has been removed or renamed. It also recommends ensuring that `autosummary_generate` is set to `True` in the `conf.py` file and creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was related to the rendering logic in the `autosummary` extension of Sphinx, specifically the `render` method of the `AutosummaryRenderer` class and the `generate_autosummary_docs` function. The RESPONSE does not address these aspects of the issue at all.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the `render` method's signature and logic, as well as changes to how the `generate_autosummary_docs` function calls the `render` method. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, focuses on verifying the existence of a class or function and updating documentation references, which is not related to the changes in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff. It does not suggest any changes to the code that would fix the rendering issue in the `autosummary` extension. Instead, it focuses on steps that are unrelated to the actual code changes needed to resolve the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the general topic of broken links in documentation and the `autosummary` extension. However, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not address the specific changes made to resolve the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
