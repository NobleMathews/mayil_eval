    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is relevant and closely aligned with the git diff, offering clear guidance on how to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `force_insert` flag not being passed through the model inheritance chain and provides a solution that involves modifying the `save_base`, `_save_parents`, and `_save_table` methods to ensure the `force_insert` parameter is properly handled. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies these methods to address the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests passing the `force_insert` flag from the `save` method to `save_base`, then to `_save_parents`, and finally to `_save_table`, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of ensuring the flag is passed through the inheritance chain.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the implementation of the `_validate_force_insert` method, which is a significant part of the git diff. This method is used to validate the `force_insert` parameter and ensure it is either a boolean or a tuple of model classes. The RESPONSE also does not mention the changes to the condition in the `_save_table` method that checks if the parent is a subclass of `force_insert`.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a relevant and actionable solution that is closely aligned with the git diff but is not complete as it omits the validation logic and the subclass check.",
