    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or provides a valid alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the 'TEST': {'MIGRATE': False} setting or setting it to True, which does not align with the git diff that aims to handle the setting when it is set to False. The RESPONSE also suggests applying all necessary migrations or manually creating the required tables, which is contrary to the purpose of setting 'MIGRATE': False, which is to avoid running migrations. The RESPONSE does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach of handling the setting programmatically within the Django framework. The only slightly relevant part is the suggestion to adjust the test setup, which is vaguely in line with the git diff's approach to modifying the test database creation process. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide any specific or actionable guidance on how to adjust the test setup, making it not useful in the context of the git diff.",
