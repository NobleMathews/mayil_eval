    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code modifications that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_get_deterministic_ordering` method in `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` to consider `UniqueConstraint` objects without conditions. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests using the `total_unique_constraints` property from `django/db/models/options.py`, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of this property.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes an additional loop to iterate over `self.lookup_opts.constraints` to check for `UniqueConstraint` objects without conditions, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff already handles this by introducing the `total_unique_constraints` property, which filters out constraints with conditions. Therefore, the additional loop in the RESPONSE is redundant and not necessary according to the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a helpful suggestion to add appropriate unit tests and ensure existing tests pass, which is good practice but not directly reflected in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it includes a redundant step that is not supported by the git diff, which prevents a perfect score.",
