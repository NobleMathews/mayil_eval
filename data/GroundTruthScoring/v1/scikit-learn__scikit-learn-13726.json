    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately addresses the issue by suggesting the addition of the `n_components` parameter to the `SpectralClustering` class constructor with a default value of `None`, which is in line with the git diff. It also correctly advises modifying the `fit` method to pass the `n_components` attribute to the `spectral_clustering` function call, which matches the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE further recommends documenting the `n_components` parameter in the class docstring, which is a valuable addition for maintaining consistency and clarity in the codebase, although this specific action is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates the proposed changes, which is helpful for the developer to understand and implement the solution. The RESPONSE does not directly mention updating the example in the docstring to reflect the new parameter, which is included in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
