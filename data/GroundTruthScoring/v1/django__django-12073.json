{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable plan to deprecate the InvalidQuery exception and replace its usages with FieldDoesNotExist and FieldError, which aligns well with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests creating a deprecation shim for InvalidQuery, which is in line with the git diff's approach of using a metaclass to handle the deprecation warning. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to replace the documented usage of InvalidQuery with FieldDoesNotExist and the undocumented usage with FieldError. However, the RESPONSE suggests creating a new exception class called DeprecatedInvalidQuery, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff uses a metaclass approach for the deprecation warning instead of creating a new exception class. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a detailed code snippet and guidance on updating the documentation and adding tests, which are not explicitly mentioned in the git diff but are relevant and valuable for a complete solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its high relevance and provision of clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, despite a minor difference in the approach to deprecation.",
