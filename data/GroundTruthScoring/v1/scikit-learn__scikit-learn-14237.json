    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue by suggesting modifications to the `fit` and `transform` methods of the `ColumnTransformer` class to handle column names correctly. It suggests storing the column names of the `remainder` columns after fitting and using these stored names during transformation, which is a relevant and actionable solution.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff. The git diff includes additional checks and error handling that are not mentioned in the RESPONSE, such as checking for reordered named columns on transform and raising a ValueError if the number of features or column ordering does not match the expectations set during fitting. The RESPONSE also does not mention the introduction of the `_check_key_type` function and the `_df_columns` attribute, which are key elements in the git diff's solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed to fix the issue, and it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the handling of the `_n_features` attribute and the detailed error messages. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers a partial solution, it is incomplete and does not fully capture the complexity of the changes made in the git diff.",
