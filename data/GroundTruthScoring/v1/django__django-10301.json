    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying a non-existent `_sqlite_power` function to handle `NULL` values, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to various files, including the use of a `none_guard` decorator to prevent functions from crashing on `NULL` values, and modifications to the `django/db/models/functions/datetime.py` and `django/db/models/functions/text.py` files to handle `NULL` values correctly. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide a similar solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff and are not relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
