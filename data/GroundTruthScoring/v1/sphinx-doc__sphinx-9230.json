    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the docstring syntax to use the correct type hinting format that Sphinx can parse correctly. However, this does not align with the git diff, which modifies the 'sphinx/util/docfields.py' file to change the way parameters are split when parsing the docstring. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the Sphinx extension's handling of the parameter syntax, which is what the git diff aims to fix.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but these do not directly contribute to solving the problem as described in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide any changes to the code that would fix the rendering issue, and instead, it suggests a workaround that may not be applicable in all cases where the Sphinx extension is used.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the need for correct parsing by Sphinx but fails to provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff. It does not offer a solution to the underlying problem in the Sphinx extension's code. The score is set to 1 because the RESPONSE is not entirely misguided but does not offer a practical solution in line with the git diff.",
