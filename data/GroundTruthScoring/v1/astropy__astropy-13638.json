    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `Quantity` object does not perform operations that would change its `dtype` from `int` to `float` and provides two example fixes. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff, which addresses the issue by modifying the `__ilshift__` method to handle exceptions and return `NotImplemented` instead of attempting to perform operations that are not compatible with the `dtype=int`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as handling `UnitConversionError` and `AttributeError`, or the in-place operation on the view of the `Quantity` object. Instead, it suggests changing the function's behavior or its return type, which is not the approach taken in the git diff.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the same error and provides general advice on handling `dtype` conversions, it does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
