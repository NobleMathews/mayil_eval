{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a high-level overview of the steps needed to address the issue of adding a warning for unique fields with callable defaults during migrations. It correctly identifies the need to modify the 'ask_unique_callable_default_addition' method in 'django/db/migrations/questioner.py' and provides a pseudo-code implementation that is very similar to the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests displaying a warning message and providing options for the user, which aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes parameters in the method signature that are not present in the git diff, and it does not mention the changes to the '_generate_added_field' method in 'autodetector.py'. However, these differences do not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the core solution and the intent behind the changes are effectively communicated and would lead the developer towards a similar solution as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its high relevance and clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
