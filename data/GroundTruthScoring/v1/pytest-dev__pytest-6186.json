    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting a default value for `junit_family` to avoid the deprecation warning, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the default value is intentionally set to `None` to trigger the deprecation warning if not set by the user. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying a `check_junit_family_deprecation` function, which does not exist in the git diff, indicating a misunderstanding of the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff or achieves similar results. However, it does correctly identify that a deprecation warning should be shown if `junit_family` is not set, which is somewhat relevant to the issue, hence the score of 2.",
