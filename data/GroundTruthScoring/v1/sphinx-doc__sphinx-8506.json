    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and be relevant given the issue and the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the QEMU documentation to match the expected option description formats that Sphinx 3.2 accepts. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the Sphinx source code to handle the option description `[enable=]PATTERN` correctly without requiring changes to the QEMU documentation. The RESPONSE fails to recognize that the issue is with Sphinx's handling of the option description, not with the QEMU documentation itself. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution that would prevent the need to alter existing documentation, which is what the git diff aims to achieve. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the error message, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
