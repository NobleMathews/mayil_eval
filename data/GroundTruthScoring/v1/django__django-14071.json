    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `_check_raw_id_fields_item` method to include a comparison between `field.name` and `field_name`, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly states that `refer_to_missing_field` should be called with the appropriate arguments if the check fails, which is in line with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE even includes a code snippet that mirrors the changes in the git diff, ensuring that the developer has a clear example to follow. The only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it includes additional information about checking the code snippets in the repository, which, while potentially helpful, is not directly related to the changes in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
