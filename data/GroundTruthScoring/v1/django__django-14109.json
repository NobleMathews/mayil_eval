    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to change the automatic migration naming from date-based to operation-based, which is the core issue. It suggests modifying the `suggest_name` method to generate names based on operations, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for a `migration_name_fragment` property in each operation class, which is in line with the git diff's use of this property to generate the migration name. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and a simplified example of how the `suggest_name` method could be modified, which is helpful and relevant. However, the RESPONSE does not include the logic to handle cases where the concatenated name exceeds a certain length, which is a significant part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also suggests truncating and appending an ellipsis, which differs from the git diff's approach of appending '_and_more'. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a clear solution, it does not fully match the git diff's approach, particularly in handling long migration names.",
