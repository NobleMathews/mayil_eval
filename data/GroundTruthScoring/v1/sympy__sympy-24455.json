    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue by suggesting a brute force method to check if the group is cyclic. It proposes iterating over all elements of the group and checking if any element's order is equal to the order of the group. This approach is actionable and would indeed fix the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's more efficient solution, which avoids the brute force method and instead corrects the logic in the existing `is_cyclic` method. The git diff suggests a change in the logic that checks if the group is abelian and then uses a more sophisticated check involving the prime factors of the group's order. The RESPONSE's suggestion is a valid but less efficient alternative to the git diff. It does not take into account the efficiency improvements made in the git diff, nor does it address the specific logic error that the git diff corrects. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of offering the best solution.",
