    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of incorrect bolometric flux when the 'scale' parameter is passed as a Quantity with 'dimensionless_unscaled' units. It suggests modifications to the 'bolometric_flux' property, '__init__' method, and 'evaluate' method to ensure that 'scale' is handled correctly. The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in that it addresses the handling of 'scale' and its impact on the bolometric flux calculation. However, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff's approach, which includes additional changes such as the introduction of '_native_units', '_native_output_units', and a more comprehensive update to the '__init__' method to handle different unit scenarios. The RESPONSE's suggested changes to the 'evaluate' method are also not as detailed as those in the git diff, which includes logic for handling input units based on the output units and a more nuanced approach to applying 'scale' in the calculation. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers some actionable advice, it is incomplete and does not fully capture the complexity of the changes made in the git diff. A score of 4 is appropriate as it provides a partial solution that could lead to a correct implementation if further developed.",
