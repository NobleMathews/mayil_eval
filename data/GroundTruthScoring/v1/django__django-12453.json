    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests wrapping the deserialization process in a transaction to handle foreign key constraints, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using a transaction to prevent integrity errors. However, the RESPONSE does not mention disabling constraint checks or manually checking for invalid keys after deserialization, which are key elements in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests modifying the `TransactionTestCase._fixture_setup` method, whereas the git diff modifies the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes required to fix the issue. While the RESPONSE is on the right track by suggesting the use of transactions, it misses important details and suggests changes in the wrong location, making it only partially relevant.",
