    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `YearLookup` class to use `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN` when `self.rhs_is_direct_value()` is `False`, and to ensure that `EXTRACT` is used for the `__iso_year` lookup. It also suggests updating the `YearExact` class and checking database backend-specific implementations for support of the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution implemented involves modifying the `year_lookup_bounds_for_date_field` and `year_lookup_bounds_for_datetime_field` methods to handle ISO-8601 week-numbering years by adding an `iso_year` parameter and adjusting the bounds calculation accordingly. The git diff also updates the `YearLookup` class to pass the `iso_year` parameter based on whether the `ExtractIsoYear` function is used.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding an `iso_year` parameter and adjusting the bounds calculation. Instead, it suggests a different approach involving the use of `EXTRACT` and modifications to the `YearExact` class, which is not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE lacks actionable content that directly corresponds to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It offers a different approach that is not supported by the git diff, and it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff to resolve the issue.",
