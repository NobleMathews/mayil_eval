    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a general solution for implementing lazy loading in Python packages but does not align closely with the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the xarray codebase, including the introduction of a 'module_available' utility function and modifications to the import statements throughout the xarray codebase to use this utility for conditional imports based on module availability. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a high-level approach without specific reference to the xarray codebase or the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of import time optimization but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using a 'lazy_import' function and modifying the xarray package to use this function for submodules that can be loaded lazily. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution involves checking for module availability and conditionally importing modules based on this check. The RESPONSE does not mention the 'module_available' function or the specific changes to import statements that are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide code examples or modifications that are directly applicable to the xarray codebase, as shown in the git diff.",
