    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are somewhat aligned with the git diff, but it does not accurately reflect the changes made in the diff. The RESPONSE suggests replacing the `repr` representation (`%r`) with a string representation (`%s`) when formatting the traceback message, which is not what the git diff does. Instead, the git diff maintains the `%r` format specifier and explicitly converts the `self.path` to a string before formatting. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to ensure the correct string representation of the file path in the traceback, which is in line with the git diff's approach of calling `str(self.path)`. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the adjustment of the line number (`self.lineno + 1`), which is also part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not closely match the git diff in terms of the specific changes required to fix the issue.",
