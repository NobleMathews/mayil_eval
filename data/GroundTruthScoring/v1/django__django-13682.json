    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_path` function in `django/urls/conf.py` to include a check for a CBV that has not been converted to a callable with `.as_view()`, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to raise a `TypeError` with a clear error message, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes an additional check for `hasattr(view, 'as_view')` which is not present in the git diff. This check is redundant because the subsequent condition `elif isinstance(view, View):` already ensures that the view is a subclass of `View`, which would have the `as_view` method. The git diff does not include this check and instead directly raises the `TypeError` if the view is an instance of `View`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a detailed explanation and includes code snippets, which are helpful. However, it does not mention the changes to `django/urls/resolvers.py` that are present in the git diff, which adds an additional check in the `_check_callback` method to provide warnings during URL resolution. This part of the git diff is not addressed in the RESPONSE, which is why the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not complete as it omits the changes to `django/urls/resolvers.py` and includes a redundant check. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
