    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to make `through_fields` hashable in the `ManyToManyRel` class, which is the core issue described. It suggests implementing or using the `make_hashable` function to convert `through_fields` to a hashable type before it is used in the `identity` property or any hashing context. This aligns with the git diff, which also adds a call to `make_hashable` for `self.through_fields` in the `identity` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to provide an example implementation of the `make_hashable` function and how to modify the `__hash__` method in `ManyToManyRel`, which is helpful and relevant to the issue. It also correctly suggests ensuring that `limit_choices_to` is hashable, which is related to the overall goal of ensuring hashability in the `ManyToManyRel` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it suggests modifying the `__hash__` method directly, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff only modifies the `identity` method, which indirectly affects the `__hash__` method. However, this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the provided guidance is still highly relevant and would lead to a resolution of the issue.",
