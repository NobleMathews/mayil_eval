    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `delete_queryset` method in the `PostAdmin` class to avoid calling `.distinct()` on the queryset before deletion. This is a reasonable approach to prevent the error from occurring, as the issue is related to calling `delete()` after `.distinct()`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which includes changes to multiple files and methods to address the issue more comprehensively. The git diff suggests a more complex solution involving renaming a variable, adjusting the logic for handling duplicates, and modifying the queryset construction to avoid the need for `.distinct()` altogether. The RESPONSE does not address these broader changes and focuses only on a specific method override, which may not fully resolve the issue as the git diff intends. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
