    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the feature request to expose `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` settings for the `Float` class in various printers within the SymPy library. It suggests modifying the `_print_Float` methods in the `MpmathPrinter`, `LatexPrinter`, and `MathMLPrinter` classes, which is partially correct as the git diff shows changes to the `_print_Float` method in the `LatexPrinter` and `StrPrinter` classes. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the `MathMLPrinter` class, which is not part of the git diff, and it incorrectly refers to the `MpmathPrinter` class, which does not exist in the provided git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding `min_fixed` and `max_fixed` to the `MpmathPrinter` class, which is not aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and a step-by-step guide, which are helpful but not entirely accurate as they do not match the git diff changes. The RESPONSE does not address the changes to the `GLSLPrinter`, `JavascriptCodePrinter`, `AbstractPythonCodePrinter`, and `StrPrinter` classes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete, warranting a score of 3.",
