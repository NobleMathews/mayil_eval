    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the changes needed to implement the feature of knowing where an object was deleted from, closely aligning with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE offers clear, actionable guidance that is highly relevant to the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary modifications to the Collector class to accept and store the origin of the delete operation, which is in line with the git diff. It also correctly identifies the need to update the delete() method in the Collector class to send the origin with the pre_delete and post_delete signals, which matches the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE further provides the correct guidance for modifying the delete() methods on models and querysets to pass the origin to the Collector, which is also reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating signal handlers to handle the new origin parameter, which, while not explicitly shown in the git diff, is a logical step given the changes to the signals.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes code snippets and references to the relevant sections of the codebase, which would be very helpful for a developer implementing these changes. The only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it does not include the exact changes to the management command file (`remove_stale_contenttypes.py`) and the admin utility file (`admin/utils.py`) as shown in the git diff, but these are minor omissions in the context of the overall RESPONSE, which remains highly valuable and actionable.",
