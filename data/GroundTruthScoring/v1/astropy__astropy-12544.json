    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to address the issue of disabling automatic masking of `NaN` values when reading a table with `astropy.table.Table.read()`. It suggests adding a new keyword argument `mask` to control the masking behavior and updating the logic for creating `MaskedColumn` instances. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which introduces a `mask_invalid` parameter to control the masking behavior. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific parameter name (`mask_invalid` vs. `mask`) and the detailed implementation changes. The RESPONSE also lacks the consideration of the interaction between the new parameter and the `memmap` argument, which is addressed in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed, instead offering a high-level overview and pseudo code, which is less actionable than the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and does not closely match the git diff.",
