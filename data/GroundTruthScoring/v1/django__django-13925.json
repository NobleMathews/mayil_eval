    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the 'DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD' setting to the project's settings file or configuring the 'default_auto_field' attribute in the app's AppConfig subclass. However, this advice does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the '_check_default_pk' method to handle inherited primary keys correctly. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific issue of the warning being incorrectly raised for models that inherit a manually specified primary key. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution to the actual problem described in the issue, which is a bug in Django 3.2 alpha related to inherited primary keys. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses primary key settings, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff or effectively resolves the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
