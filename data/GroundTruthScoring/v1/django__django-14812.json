    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `ArticleInline` class to specify the correct `fk_name` that points to the `SpecialJournalist` model and changing the `fk_name` in `ArticleInline` to match the field name on the `Article` model that relates to `SpecialJournalist`. However, this advice does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `_get_foreign_key` function to handle ForeignKey relationships to proxy models correctly. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the Django code that causes the admin.E202 error when using proxy models with InlineModelAdmin. Instead, it incorrectly suggests that the developer should change the `fk_name` or the ForeignKey relationship, which is not supported by the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the Django framework's handling of ForeignKey relationships to proxy models, not changing the ForeignKey field names in the user's models. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help the developer fix the issue.",
