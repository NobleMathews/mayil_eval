    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice and partially match the git diff but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the `__in` lookup on `JSONField` when using key transforms and suggests modifying the `KeyTransformIn` class, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also correctly notes that the issue affects MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite databases, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE proposes changes to a method called `resolve_expression_parameter`, which does not exist in the git diff. Instead, the git diff modifies the `process_rhs` method within the `KeyTransformIn` class. The RESPONSE's proposed solution is not directly aligned with the git diff's changes and introduces a method that is not part of the actual fix.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the correct SQL handling for each database vendor as shown in the git diff. The git diff includes specific SQL functions and JSON handling for Oracle, MySQL/MariaDB, and SQLite/MySQL, which are not accurately reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to use `JSON_EXISTS` for Oracle, `JSON_CONTAINS` for MySQL, and `JSON_EXTRACT` with the `IN` clause for SQLite does not match the git diff's approach and may not be effective in resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention registering the `KeyTransformIn` lookup with `KeyTransform.register_lookup`, which is a crucial step in the git diff to make the new lookup available.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information and a general direction for fixing the issue but lacks the correct details and actionable steps that align with the git diff's solution. Therefore, it scores a 4 for being partially relevant but incomplete and not closely matching the git diff.",
