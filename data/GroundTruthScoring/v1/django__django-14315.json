    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'settings_to_cmd_args_env' method in 'django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py' to merge 'os.environ' with the 'env' dictionary before returning it. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the correct solution is to modify the 'settings_to_cmd_args_env' method to return '(env or None)' instead of always returning 'env', and to adjust the 'runshell' method in 'django/db/backends/base/client.py' to conditionally merge 'os.environ' with 'env' if 'env' is not None.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the issue of returning None when 'env' is empty, which is a key part of the git diff solution. Instead, it suggests always merging 'os.environ' with 'env', which could lead to an incorrect environment being passed to the subprocess if 'env' is meant to be None. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly states that there is no need to merge 'env' with 'os.environ' in the 'runshell' method, which contradicts the git diff that includes this merge conditionally.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the correct files and methods involved in the issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
