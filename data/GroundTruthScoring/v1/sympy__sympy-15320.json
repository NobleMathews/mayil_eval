    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the `RootOf` function in SymPy not handling the generator correctly when a substitution results in a polynomial with the same form but a different generator. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a check to ensure that the generator must be a Symbol and raising a PolynomialError if it is not. The RESPONSE suggests checking if the generator has changed after substitution and updating the `RootOf` object accordingly, which is a different approach and does not directly address the issue of ensuring the generator is a Symbol. The RESPONSE does not include the actual code changes made in the git diff, such as the added documentation and error handling. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
