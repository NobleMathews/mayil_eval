    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results. It offers general advice and troubleshooting steps that are not specific to the issue described. The git diff shows specific code changes to handle variable-length arrays (VLAs) in FITS files, particularly addressing issues with reshaping arrays, calculating the correct number of elements, and handling multi-dimensional VLAs. The RESPONSE, however, does not address these specific changes or provide alternative solutions that would lead to the same outcome. Instead, it suggests general troubleshooting steps such as checking array bounds and using correct encodings, which are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff and the issue at hand.",
