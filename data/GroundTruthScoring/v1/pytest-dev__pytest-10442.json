    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to the issue of keeping temporary directories only for failing tests in pytest. It suggests modifying the fixture to tag or mark the temporary directories associated with failing tests and adjusting the cleanup logic. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff includes specific changes to the `tmpdir.py` and `pathlib.py` files, introducing new configuration options, modifying the cleanup process, and handling the retention policy based on test outcomes. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes or provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach. Instead, it offers a high-level overview and pseudo-code that does not reflect the actual changes needed according to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks the actionable content and specificity required to be considered a close match to the git diff.",
