    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation about the `requests` library's goal to abstract away `urllib3` exceptions and suggests that encountering such exceptions directly could be a bug or oversight. It offers a workaround to catch `urllib3` exceptions explicitly and proposes a method to contribute a change to the `requests` library. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which includes specific changes to the `requests` library to handle `urllib3` exceptions and does not mention catching exceptions in user code or contributing changes.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows specific changes to the `requests` library to handle `urllib3` exceptions, such as adding imports for `urllib3` exceptions and modifying the exception handling logic. In contrast, the RESPONSE suggests that users catch `urllib3` exceptions in their own code and consider contributing a change to the `requests` library, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the handling of exceptions in the `requests` library, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's solution to the problem.",
