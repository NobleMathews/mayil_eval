    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the 'autodoc_preserve_defaults' configuration option and setting it to 'True' in 'conf.py', which is a relevant suggestion as the git diff indicates that the 'autodoc_preserve_defaults' setting is being checked. However, the RESPONSE does not provide any guidance on modifying the code to preserve hexadecimal values, which is the core of the git diff. The git diff shows a more complex solution involving the addition of a new function 'get_default_value' and modifications to 'update_defvalue' to handle hexadecimal values correctly. The RESPONSE also suggests updating Sphinx or manually documenting the default value, which are not solutions reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the specific code changes needed to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. The links provided in the RESPONSE are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not offer actionable guidance for the issue at hand.",
