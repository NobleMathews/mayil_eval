    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_process_contour_level_args` method to check if the input `z` array is of boolean type and to set the `levels_arg` to `[0.5]` by default for boolean arrays, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the behavior should be documented and that existing functionality for non-boolean arrays should remain unchanged, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of code, but it effectively communicates the same solution concept. It suggests using `np.issubdtype(z_dtype, bool)` to check for boolean arrays and setting `levels_arg` to `[0.5]`, which is what the git diff implements. The RESPONSE also correctly points out that this change should be made in the `lib/matplotlib/contour.py` file, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the changes made to the `_contour_args` method and the `_check_xyz` method, which are also part of the git diff. However, these changes are not directly related to the issue of auto-detecting boolean arrays for contour levels, so the RESPONSE's omission of these details does not significantly detract from its value in resolving the main issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative approach to the git diff that would effectively resolve the issue described. It is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable a developer to implement the necessary changes to fix the issue.",
