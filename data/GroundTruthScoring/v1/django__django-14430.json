{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_aggregation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to handle the case when `pk__in` receives an empty list and to ensure that `Coalesce` correctly returns the value provided by `Value(0)` when `Sum('quantity')` is `None`. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of `Coalesce` not working properly with an empty result set, it does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff introduces a new attribute `empty_aggregate_value` in various classes and modifies the `SQLCompiler` class to handle empty result sets differently, rather than modifying the `get_aggregation` method as suggested by the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the exception handling for `EmptyResultSet` in the `aggregate` method to return the default value specified in `Coalesce` is somewhat relevant but does not match the git diff's approach of handling empty aggregates at a more fundamental level in the class definitions and SQL compiler. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it offers a somewhat relevant but incomplete and not directly aligned solution to the issue.",
