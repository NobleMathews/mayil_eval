    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `parse_mathematica` function to handle Greek characters and to ensure correct symbol mapping, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the tokenization process, adding a condition to check if the string is ASCII before applying the tokenizer. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or any similar tokenization logic. Instead, it suggests checking symbol mappings and parser rules, which are not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE also recommends adding a unit test, which is a good practice but is not part of the git diff provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
