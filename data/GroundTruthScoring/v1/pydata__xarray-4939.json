    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a `reduce` method to the `DataArrayCoarsen` class. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests manually applying the `unique` function to each block of the coarsened array using a loop or list comprehension, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the addition of the `reduce` method, which is the core solution to the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets and does not provide a clear, actionable solution based on the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in guiding the developer to implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
