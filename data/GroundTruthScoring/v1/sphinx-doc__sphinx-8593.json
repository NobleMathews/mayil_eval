    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the autodoc configuration and updating the .rst file to include the `:private-members:` option, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the Python source code to add a new method `get_module_members` and update the `get_object_members` method within the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes needed in the Sphinx extension and instead provides general advice on configuring Sphinx documentation, which is not relevant to the issue described. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, it does mention the need to check for updates or bug fixes related to the `:meta public:` tag, which is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff.",
