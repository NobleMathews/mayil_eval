    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of the query string being dropped in redirects. It suggests modifying the `catch_all_view` method to include the query string in the redirect path, which aligns with the goal of the git diff. The RESPONSE also offers a code snippet that constructs the `redirect_path` with the query string, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of using `request.get_full_path(force_append_slash=True)`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to include a trailing slash if `settings.APPEND_SLASH` is `True`, which is consistent with the git diff's intent to respect the `should_append_slash` attribute. However, the RESPONSE does not use the `get_full_path` method with the `force_append_slash` parameter as the git diff does, which is a more concise and Django-specific way of handling the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a highly relevant and actionable solution that achieves a similar result to the git diff, but with a slightly different approach.",
