    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `build()` function in `sphinx/cmd/build.py` and checking the `Makefile` and Sphinx configuration for errors. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix was made in `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py`, where a list comprehension was added to prevent the iteration over a changing list during the Sphinx documentation build process. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of modifying the iteration over `self.document.findall(matcher)` to handle new nodes being added during iteration, which is the cause of the `IndexError`. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
