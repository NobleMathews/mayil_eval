    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but may not closely match the git diff. It should provide some guidance towards resolving the issue but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `WSGIRequestHandler.log_message` method and updating the `ServerFormatter` class to use a consistent `datefmt`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of inconsistent datetime logging. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which simply adds a `default_time_format` to the `ServerFormatter` class without modifying the `WSGIRequestHandler` or specifying the `datefmt` parameter when constructing the logger. The RESPONSE also suggests creating a new formatter class if `ServerFormatter` is not defined, which is unnecessary as the git diff shows that `ServerFormatter` is indeed present and being modified. The RESPONSE does not directly address the issue in the same way as the git diff, and it introduces additional steps that are not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader issue of logging consistency but fails to provide the specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach.",
