    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue of the 'formats' argument not being respected when writing an astropy table to HTML format. It suggests checking and modifying the `write` method and any associated classes or functions that handle HTML output to ensure that the `formats` argument is processed correctly. This is actionable advice that could lead a developer in the right direction.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes made to the `astropy/io/ascii/html.py` file, including the addition of `self.data.cols = cols` and `self.data._set_col_formats()` within the `write` method. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or methods, nor does it provide guidance on implementing these particular lines of code.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of formatting not being applied, but it lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff that would make it more complete. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides a starting point for a developer but does not offer the precise changes needed to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff.",
