    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring unique `db_table` values for each model and provides guidance on how to change the `db_table` value in the model's `Meta` class. It also suggests using abstract inheritance or multi-table inheritance to avoid conflicts. While these suggestions are generally good practices in Django, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue is addressed by introducing a conditional check for `settings.DATABASE_ROUTERS` and changing the error class and message accordingly. The RESPONSE does not address the use of database routers or the modification of error messages, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of table name conflicts but fails to provide actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
