    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of ContentType migration 0002 not populating the legacy name field on a non-default database when rolled back.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reversing the order of `migrations.RunPython` operations and modifying the `Migration` class in `0002_remove_content_type_name.py`. However, the git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the `add_legacy_name` function to use the correct database alias when querying `ContentType` objects. The RESPONSE does not address the use of the database alias, which is the key change in the git diff to resolve the issue. Instead, it suggests changes to the migration operations order and hints, which are not related to the issue described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it pertains to the same migration file and attempts to address the rollback process, but it fails to provide the correct actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
