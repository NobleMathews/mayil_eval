    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the `Range` class and the `imageset` function, which is consistent with the ISSUE description. It suggests modifying the `size` property to handle symbolic ranges without raising a `ValueError` and ensuring that `imageset` can handle symbolic `Range` objects. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff includes specific changes to the `__iter__`, `size`, and `__getitem__` methods of the `Range` class, as well as a change to the `_state_converter` method in the `stochastic_process_types.py` file. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific changes or methods, nor does it provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE's proposed changes to the `size` property and the `imageset` function are not reflected in the git diff, and the RESPONSE does not address the changes to the `__iter__` and `__getitem__` methods or the `_state_converter` method. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
