    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_make_hash_value` method to include the user's email in the hash value generation, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes the exact code change needed, which matches the git diff's approach. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes further by suggesting methods to invalidate existing tokens when the email changes and to maintain the user's session, which are relevant to the issue but not covered by the git diff. The only reason for not giving a score of 10 is that the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions that are not part of the git diff, such as updating the `email_changed` method and calling `update_session_auth_hash`. While these suggestions are valuable and related to the overall issue, they are not part of the git diff's solution. However, these additional suggestions do not detract from the value of the RESPONSE as they provide a more comprehensive solution to the issue.",
