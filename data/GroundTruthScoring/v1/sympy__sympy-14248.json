    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to fixing the issue with the printing of matrix expressions in SymPy, specifically targeting the `_print_MatAdd` and `_print_MatMul` methods in the `latex.py` and `pretty.py` files. It suggests modifying these methods to handle the unary minus operator correctly and to ensure that the negative sign is associated with the matrix terms rather than being printed as a multiplication by `-1`. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets, which could guide the developer to the relevant sections of the codebase.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `_print_MatAdd` and `_print_MatMul` methods across different printer files (`latex.py`, `pretty.py`, and `str.py`), including the handling of signs and the restructuring of the printing logic. The RESPONSE's suggested changes are somewhat relevant but lack the specificity and detail present in the git diff. For example, the RESPONSE's code snippets do not match the changes in the git diff, such as the introduction of list comprehensions, the handling of the sign variable, and the restructuring of the logic for printing matrix expressions.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address changes to the `str.py` file, which is included in the git diff, and it introduces a `_coeff_isneg` function, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE's code snippets contain errors, such as the use of `parens` as a lambda function and the incorrect handling of the `args` variable in the `_print_MatMul` method.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a partially relevant approach to the issue but lacks the detail and specificity of the git diff, and it includes suggestions that do not align with the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
