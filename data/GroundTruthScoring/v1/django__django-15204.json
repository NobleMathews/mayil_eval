    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file (`django/utils/dateparse.py`) and function (`parse_duration`) where the issue resides, which aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests that the regular expression or parsing logic needs to be updated to handle malformed input, which is also what the git diff does by modifying the regular expression to handle decimal points correctly.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to update the regular expression, whereas the git diff specifically changes the regular expression to accept both a dot and a comma as decimal separators. The RESPONSE also suggests adding unit tests for the malformed input case, which is a good practice but not reflected in the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the issue at hand, as the git diff does not modify anything in the `forms/fields.py` or `db/models/fields/__init__.py` files. This information is not harmful but does not add value in the context of the specific issue and git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is relevant to the issue but lacks the specificity and complete alignment with the git diff, warranting a score of 4.",
