    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. The git diff indicates that the issue is related to a deprecation warning when constructing a variable with a DataArray, which will raise a TypeError in a future release. The RESPONSE, however, discusses an unrelated problem with the chunking behavior of dask DataArrays after using the `update()` method in a Dataset, which is not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippets and links to the xarray repository that do not pertain to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist developers in fixing the issue, warranting a score of 0.",
