{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue of bailing out the extlink replacement suggestion. It suggests adding a new configuration option to allow users to opt out of the suggestion for specific links, which is in line with the git diff's approach of adding a condition to the check_uri method. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it proposes a new configuration option and additional changes to the documentation, which are not present in the git diff. However, the core idea of modifying the check_uri method to include a condition that checks for the presence of a '/' in the extlink is aligned with the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, providing a high-level overview and a detailed implementation guide, which would be very useful to a developer addressing this issue. The RESPONSE does not score higher because it includes additional steps that are not reflected in the git diff, such as adding a configuration option and updating documentation, which, while useful, are not part of the git diff's solution.",
