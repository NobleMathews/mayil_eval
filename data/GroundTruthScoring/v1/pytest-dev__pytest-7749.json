    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions, such as defining or importing the missing `deco` decorator, ensuring its availability, checking pytest's collection and error reporting mechanisms, and investigating the `IndexError` in `_pytest/_code/code.py`. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff provided, which specifically addresses an issue with the line number calculation for decorated functions during the pytest collection phase. The RESPONSE fails to address the core issue of the crash during collection due to incorrect line number handling, which is what the git diff aims to fix. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the resolution of the issue as described and as fixed by the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses pytest's collection and error reporting mechanisms, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
