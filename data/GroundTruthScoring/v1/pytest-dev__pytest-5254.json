    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests renaming the fixture to avoid conflict with the parameterized value, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue is being addressed by modifying the internal handling of fixtures and parametrization within pytest, specifically by adding a new method to identify direct parametrization arguments and updating the fixture closure logic to ignore these arguments. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue of pytest's handling of fixtures and parametrization, nor does it offer a viable alternative solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
