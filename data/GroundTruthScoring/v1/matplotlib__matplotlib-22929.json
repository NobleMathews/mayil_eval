    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `bar_label` function to handle `np.nan` values and provides a general approach to dealing with missing dependent values or error bars. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `hlines`, `vlines`, and error checking logic using `np.nanmin`, `np.nanmax`, and a more robust error comparison that includes handling of `nan` values. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, focuses on modifying the `bar_label` function and provides a high-level description without specific code changes that match the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the `hlines` and `vlines` functions, nor does it provide an alternative solution to the error checking logic that was updated in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of handling `nan` values, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
