{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described. It suggests reviewing and modifying the `raise_last_exception` function in `django/utils/autoreload.py` to re-raise the stored exception without constructing a new one, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE's proposed code change is slightly different from the git diff but achieves the same result, which is to fix the issue with custom exceptions like `MyException` that have additional required arguments. The RESPONSE suggests using `exc_value.with_traceback(exc_traceback)` which is a valid way to preserve the original exception's signature and traceback. However, it does not exactly match the git diff, which simply raises `exc_value` without the `with_traceback` method. This minor difference does not affect the effectiveness of the solution, but it does not match the git diff exactly, which is why the RESPONSE is scored an 8 instead of a 10.",
