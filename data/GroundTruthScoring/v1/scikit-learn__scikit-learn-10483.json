    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to move the imputation out of preprocessing and into its own module, which is the main goal of the issue. It suggests creating a new module for imputation, moving relevant classes and functions, updating imports, and ensuring proper exposure and documentation, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a new 'impute' module and deprecating the old 'Imputer' class in favor of 'SimpleImputer'.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides an example of how the `__init__.py` in the `sklearn/impute` directory might look and how to refactor an import statement in another part of the codebase, which is helpful and relevant to the issue. Additionally, it mentions updating the documentation and examples, which is a necessary step not explicitly shown in the git diff but is implied as part of the process.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it effectively communicates the same end result, which is the creation of a new 'impute' module and the deprecation of the old 'Imputer' class. The RESPONSE omits the specific deprecation message and the changes to the estimator checks, but these are minor details compared to the overall task of restructuring the imputation classes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, providing actionable steps to achieve the desired outcome of the issue.",
