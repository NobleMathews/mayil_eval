    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests adding an attribute `_facecolors2d` to the `Poly3DCollection` class or ensuring it is set before calling `get_facecolors()`, which is in line with the git diff that adds checks for the existence of `_facecolors2d` and `_edgecolors2d` before returning them. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to call `do_3d_projection` to initialize these attributes, which is exactly what the git diff does by calling `do_3d_projection` if the attributes are not set.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by providing links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer to understand the context and the location of the changes needed. This additional guidance enhances the utility of the RESPONSE.\n\nThe only reason for not giving a perfect score of 10 is that the RESPONSE does not explicitly include the addition of comments that explain why the checks are necessary, as seen in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
