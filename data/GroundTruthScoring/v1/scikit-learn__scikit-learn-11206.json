    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_incremental_mean_and_var' function to handle NaN values, which is aligned with the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows changes across multiple files, including 'incremental_pca.py', 'data.py', 'estimator_checks.py', 'extmath.py', and 'sparsefuncs.py', indicating a broader scope of updates to handle NaN values across different parts of the scikit-learn library. The RESPONSE focuses solely on the '_incremental_mean_and_var' function and does not address the other changes shown in the git diff, such as handling NaN values in the 'scale' function, updating class attributes, and modifying checks for estimators that allow NaN values. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed, instead offering a general outline of what should be done, which lacks actionable guidance. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
