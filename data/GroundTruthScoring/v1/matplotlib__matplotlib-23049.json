{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue, which is the absence of a `minor` keyword argument in the `plt.xticks()` function, and suggests adding it to align with the object-oriented interface. The RESPONSE also offers a high-level overview of the changes that would be needed, which includes adding a `minor` keyword argument and using it to set the minor ticks accordingly. This aligns closely with the git diff provided, which shows the actual code changes made to implement the `minor` keyword argument in both `xticks` and `yticks` functions. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes as the git diff, but it does offer a clear, actionable, and relevant solution that achieves the same result. The RESPONSE could have scored a 10 if it had included the exact changes for both `xticks` and `yticks` functions as shown in the git diff, but it focuses only on `xticks` and provides a high-level overview instead of the specific code changes. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate.",
