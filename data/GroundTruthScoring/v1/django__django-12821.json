{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the minification steps from the build script and updating references to `.min.js` files in `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py`. However, the git diff does not include any changes to `widgets.py`, and the RESPONSE does not mention the correct files that were actually modified according to the git diff, such as `helpers.py` and `options.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation URL and ensuring vendored libraries continue to be distributed in their minified form, which is aligned with the issue description but not directly related to the git diff. The RESPONSE also fails to mention the deletion of the `compress.py` script, which is a significant part of the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
