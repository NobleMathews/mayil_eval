{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the __radd__ method to the SimpleLazyObject class using new_method_proxy, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the __add__ method using new_method_proxy. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle the right-hand side addition operation and suggests initializing the _wrapped object if it is empty before performing the addition, which is a correct approach and aligns with the git diff's implementation of __radd__.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests using operator.add for the __radd__ method, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff uses a custom implementation for __radd__ that directly adds the other object to self, without using operator.add. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to define __radd__ explicitly if operator.add does not work, which is unnecessary since the git diff already provides the correct implementation.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides relevant links to the codebase for further reference, which is helpful but not directly related to the implementation of the solution. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes an unnecessary alternative suggestion and a minor misunderstanding of the operator to use, which prevents it from scoring higher.",
