    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `save()` method in the `Sample` model to check if the instance already exists in the database and to update it if it does. This approach is significantly different from the git diff provided, which adds a condition to the `_save_table` method in the Django model base to handle the issue globally for all models. The RESPONSE's approach is not aligned with the git diff, as it suggests a model-specific solution rather than a framework-level fix. Additionally, the RESPONSE's solution could introduce performance issues and unexpected side effects by overriding the `save()` method and manually handling object retrieval and attribute assignment, which is not recommended for Django models. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue described, which is the change in behavior of Django's ORM when dealing with default primary keys. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of handling explicit primary key values, but it fails to provide a solution that is aligned with the git diff or that would be effective at the framework level. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
