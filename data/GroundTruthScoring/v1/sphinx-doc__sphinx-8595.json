    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows a change in the `get_object_members` method within the `autodoc` extension for Sphinx, specifically changing the condition to check if `self.__all__` is `None` rather than not set. This change is meant to handle the case where `__all__` is an empty list, which should result in no members being documented. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying the `__all__` attribute in the `example.py` module and adjusting the `autosummary_ignore_module_all` configuration option, which is not related to the actual code change needed in the Sphinx extension. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reporting the issue to the Sphinx project, which is unnecessary since the git diff provides the solution. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references the `autosummary` extension instead of `autodoc`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and misguided, offering no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
