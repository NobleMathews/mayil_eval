    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It offers general advice on optimizing the `count_ops` function and suggests profiling to identify inefficiencies. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `_combine_inverse` method in `add.py`, the `_should_evalf` method in `function.py`, and the `_matches_commutative` method in `operations.py`. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests that the issue might be due to an infinite loop or very long computation time, which is not supported by the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved through specific code changes, not by adding checks or timeout mechanisms. The RESPONSE does not provide any insights into the actual changes made in the git diff, such as handling infinity in a different way or optimizing the pattern matching in expressions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative approach to the issue described.",
