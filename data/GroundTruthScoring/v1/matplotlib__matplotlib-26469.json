    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps and code modifications that are partially aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to change the default value of `keep_empty` to `False` and to add a deprecation warning. However, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff introduces a new `_UNSET` object to handle the default parameter value and modifies the `__init__` and `close` methods accordingly, while the RESPONSE suggests directly setting the default to `False` and checking for `UNSET` only. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `__slots__` and the introduction of the `_ensure_file` method, which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a suggestion to update documentation, examples, and tests, which is not part of the git diff but is a good practice. Overall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant, warranting a score of 4.",
