    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to score.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides guidance on how to fix an issue with the IncrementalPCA component of scikit-learn, which is unrelated to the git diff provided. The git diff addresses a different issue in the classification_report function within the sklearn/metrics/classification.py file, specifically changing how micro-average is reported to avoid confusion. The RESPONSE does not mention or address this issue at all, instead focusing on a completely different component and problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer any actionable advice or solutions relevant to the issue described in the git diff.",
