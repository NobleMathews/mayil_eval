    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a detailed explanation and a code snippet that aligns closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to apply the sample_weight to samples with all true or all false labels and suggests modifying the `label_ranking_average_precision_score` function accordingly. The RESPONSE also correctly points out that the normalization of the final score by the sum of sample weights should be done outside the loop, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes additional context and explanation, but the core solution it proposes is effectively the same. The RESPONSE correctly moves the calculation of `aux` and the application of `sample_weight` into the conditional block that checks for all true or all false labels, which is the key change needed to fix the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides references to the relevant code snippets in the sklearn repository, which is helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed. This additional information is valuable and supports the developer in understanding the context of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it includes a bit more context than the git diff, which is not necessary for the fix but does not detract from the accuracy of the solution provided.",
