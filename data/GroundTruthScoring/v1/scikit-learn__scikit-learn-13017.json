    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `ColumnTransformer` correctly interprets negative column indexes and modifying the `_fit_transform` and `_transform` methods to handle negative indexes. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `_get_column_indices` function to handle both integer keys and boolean masks in a unified way, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of refactoring the code to handle index conversion in a single location. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding checks and conversions for negative indexes in multiple places, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about handling negative indexes, but it does not offer a solution that aligns closely with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score for its partial relevance but lack of alignment with the git diff.",
