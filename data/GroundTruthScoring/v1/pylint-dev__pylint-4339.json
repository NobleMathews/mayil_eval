    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature of supporting output to a file, which is relevant to the issue. It suggests adding a new command-line argument and modifying the pylint execution logic, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a new '_output' attribute and handling it in the '__init__' method and the 'check' method. The RESPONSE also includes pseudo-code examples for adding the argument and handling output redirection, which are helpful and actionable. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific callback function 'cb_set_output' and the exact changes to the '__init__' method that are present in the git diff, which would have been necessary for a perfect score.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in terms of the overall approach to the issue. It correctly identifies the need to add a new command-line argument and modify the pylint execution logic to redirect output to a file. The RESPONSE provides pseudo-code examples that are similar to the changes in the git diff, such as adding an argument and handling output redirection. However, it does not mention the specific implementation details such as the callback function 'cb_set_output' and the exact changes to the '__init__' method, which are key elements in the git diff. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not a direct match in terms of the specific implementation details.",
