    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described, which is to preserve the original ImportError stack trace while raising InvalidTemplateLibrary.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_package_libraries` function to preserve the original `ImportError` stack trace, which aligns with the issue's goal. However, the RESPONSE advises removing the `try-except` block entirely, which is not in line with the git diff provided. The git diff suggests modifying the exception handling to use the `from e` syntax to keep the original stack trace while still raising `InvalidTemplateLibrary`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to let the original `ImportError` propagate would change the behavior of the function and is not a viable alternative in this context, as the intention is to raise `InvalidTemplateLibrary` with the original context, not to eliminate the custom exception handling entirely. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
