    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_get_sys_info()` function to include BLAS information and adding a section to print BLAS information in the `show_versions()` function. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of adding a `show_versions()` function similar to pandas and includes BLAS information, it does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that a new file `sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py` is created with a `show_versions()` function that gathers system, BLAS, and dependency information, and then prints it. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying existing functions and does not mention creating a new file or the specific implementation details provided in the git diff, such as the use of `sklearn._build_utils.get_blas_info` to get BLAS information. The RESPONSE also includes some unnecessary details about threadpoolctl and OpenMP, which are not present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the changes required to resolve the issue.",
