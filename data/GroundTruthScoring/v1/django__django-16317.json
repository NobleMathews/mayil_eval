    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to handle the primary key field name in the `unique_fields` parameter within the `bulk_create` method, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE suggests replacing occurrences of \"pk\" with the actual primary key field name using `self.model._meta.pk.name`, which is a valid and effective solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises checking the SQL generation logic and the specific commit that may have introduced the issue, which is a reasonable step for debugging, although it is not directly related to the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, which uses a list comprehension to handle the 'pk' replacement, but it achieves the same result and is a viable alternative. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
