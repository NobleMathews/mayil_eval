    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests renaming the dimension \"method\" to avoid the conflict with internal method parameters or reserved words, which is a valid workaround for the issue described. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix implemented in the codebase was to change the way the 'sel' method is called by passing the 'key' argument directly instead of unpacking it into keyword arguments. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change, which is the core of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but these do not directly address the specific change made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a workaround rather than addressing the root cause of the issue as the git diff does.",
