    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to resolving issues with custom transformers within a `FeatureUnion` when `transform_output` is set to \"pandas\". It suggests ensuring that the `transform` method of `MyTransformer` returns a DataFrame with the correct shape and that the output DataFrame has the same index as the input DataFrame. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function in the scikit-learn library, where the index assignment is causing a `ValueError` due to a length mismatch.\n\nThe git diff provided shows that the fix involves modifying the `_wrap_in_pandas_container` function to avoid reassigning the index if the `data_to_wrap` is already a DataFrame. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific fix or provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same result. Instead, it offers a hypothetical fix within the `transform` method of `MyTransformer`, which is not directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets in the scikit-learn repository, but these links are not directly relevant to the specific issue or the git diff provided. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves a similar result, and therefore, it does not provide significant value towards fixing the issue.",
