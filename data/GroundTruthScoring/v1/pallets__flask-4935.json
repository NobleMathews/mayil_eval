    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on configuring Flask applications with subdomains, but it does not address the specific issue of nested blueprints not being respected when mounted on subdomains. The git diff shows that the fix involves modifying the blueprint registration logic to correctly handle subdomains for nested blueprints, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or a viable alternative solution. The only slightly relevant part is the mention of ensuring the `subdomain` parameter is set correctly when registering the `parent` blueprint, but this does not address the core issue or the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests checking code snippets from a repository that is not part of the issue or the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in resolving the issue and does not align with the git diff, warranting a low score.",
