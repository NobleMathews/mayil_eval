    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests adding a `--check` flag to the `migrate` command, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to exit with a non-zero status code if unapplied migrations are found, which is in line with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE goes further to provide a high-level overview of the changes needed, including the addition of the `--check` argument and the implementation of the `check_unapplied_migrations` method. The RESPONSE's code snippet is consistent with the git diff's approach, including the import of `sys` and the use of `sys.exit(1)` to exit with a non-zero status. The only minor difference is that the RESPONSE provides a more detailed explanation and a slightly different implementation of the checking logic, which does not detract from its effectiveness or relevance. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly valuable and deserves a score of 9.",
