    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a review of the `floatformat` function and the rounding mechanism, which is relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE mentions modifying the rounding logic and testing with edge cases but does not offer a concrete solution or code change. The git diff, on the other hand, shows a specific change where the sign is checked after the rounding operation, and the condition is updated to check the rounded value as well. The RESPONSE fails to mention this critical aspect of the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking an `m = int(d) - d` calculation that does not appear in the git diff, indicating a potential misunderstanding of the issue or the existing code. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff.",
