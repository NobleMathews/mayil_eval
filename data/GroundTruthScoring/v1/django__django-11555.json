    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with `OrderBy` objects in `Meta.ordering` during test database setup. It suggests checking and modifying the model definitions, handling `OrderBy` objects in the `get_order_dir` function, and reviewing the test database setup code. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows a precise change in the `find_ordering_name` function, where it adds a check for `OrderBy` instances and appends them to the results list. The RESPONSE does not mention this function or the specific change needed. Instead, it provides a broad overview and links to various code snippets that may or may not be directly related to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the need to handle `OrderBy` objects but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
