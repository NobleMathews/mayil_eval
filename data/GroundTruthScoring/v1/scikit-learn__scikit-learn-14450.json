    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff, and it does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking for NaN values and handling constant features by adding noise or removing them. However, the git diff shows that the actual solution involves modifying the `_nipals_twoblocks_inner_loop` function to handle constant columns in `Y` by selecting a non-constant column to initialize `y_score`. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of handling constant columns in `Y` and instead provides general advice that is not relevant to the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests looking at code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, as evidenced by the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
