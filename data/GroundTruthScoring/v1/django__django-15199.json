{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan for deprecating the `name` argument of the `cached_property` in Django, which is the issue at hand. It includes actionable steps such as identifying usages, removing the argument, updating the implementation, and ensuring functionality. The RESPONSE also suggests updating documentation and adding tests, which are good practices but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE's suggestion to issue a deprecation warning aligns with the git diff, which adds a warning when the `name` argument is provided. However, the RESPONSE goes further by suggesting the removal of the `name` argument from all instances, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff only shows the addition of a deprecation warning and does not indicate that the `name` argument should be removed from existing usages. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a pseudo-code example that is similar to the git diff's approach but not identical. The RESPONSE does not mention the import of the `warnings` module, which is present in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional steps not present in the git diff and omits the import of `warnings`. Therefore, it scores a 7.",
