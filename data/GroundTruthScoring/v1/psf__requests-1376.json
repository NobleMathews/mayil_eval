    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue lies within the `test_unicode_multipart_post_fieldnames` function and the encoding of the `data` dictionary key. It recommends changing the way the `data` dictionary is constructed and ensuring that the `RequestEncodingMixin` class or the `_encode_files` method handles the encoding of field names correctly. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual change made to fix the issue was in the `prepare_url` method of the `requests/models.py` file, where a string formatting placeholder was corrected from `%t` to `%r`. The RESPONSE does not address this change at all and instead focuses on an unrelated part of the code. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue described.",
