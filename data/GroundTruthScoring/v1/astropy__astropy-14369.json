    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with the parsing of composite units in the `ascii.cds` reader within `astropy.table`. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves a similar result.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing parsing rules and regular expressions in `astropy/units/format/cds_parsetab.py` and `astropy/units/format/cds.py`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not mention the specific changes needed in the grammar or the parser, as shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the URL for the unity library should be updated and that the order of division in the grammar should be corrected. The RESPONSE fails to mention these specific changes and instead provides a broad overview of steps to take, such as reviewing the unit conversion logic and adding unit tests.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable steps that directly address the changes shown in the git diff, such as updating the URL or correcting the order of division in the grammar. It also does not offer an alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
