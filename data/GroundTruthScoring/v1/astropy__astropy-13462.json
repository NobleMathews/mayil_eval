    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the `two_sum` function and its handling of large floating-point numbers, which is somewhat relevant to the problem described in the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Instead, it suggests reviewing and possibly refactoring the `two_sum` function for numerical stability, which is a general approach and does not offer specific instructions on how to fix the issue.\n\nThe git diff provided shows that the actual changes made to address the issue were in the `day_frac` function, not the `two_sum` function. The RESPONSE fails to mention the `day_frac` function or the specific changes made to it, such as the introduction of a new calculation for `frac` and `excess` using `np.where` and the adjustment of the rounding logic.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide any actionable steps that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff, and it does not offer an alternative solution that would achieve the same result. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
