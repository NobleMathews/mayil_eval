    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and fails to offer actionable guidance to resolve the specific issue described. The git diff indicates that the solution involves passing an additional argument, 'hdulist', to the WCS constructor within the 'wcs.py' file. However, the RESPONSE suggests general debugging steps and reviews of various parts of the codebase, which are not directly related to the specific change shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the issue at hand. There is no mention of the need to pass the 'hdulist' to the WCS constructor, which is the core of the solution according to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any meaningful assistance to the developer in fixing the issue and should be scored a 0.",
