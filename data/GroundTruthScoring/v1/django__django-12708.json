    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are generally in the right direction for addressing the issue described. It suggests identifying constraints, modifying the method to handle multiple constraints, and updating the method to handle the deletion of `index_together` correctly when a `unique_together` constraint exists on the same fields. These steps are relevant to the issue of migration crashes when deleting an `index_together` that has a `unique_together` on the same fields.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a specific change in the `alter_index_together` method, where a dictionary is updated to include both 'index' and 'unique' keys with appropriate boolean values. This change is meant to address the issue directly within the Django framework's schema handling. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader approach without specifying the exact changes to the code. It does not mention the addition of the 'unique' key to the dictionary, which is a key part of the git diff solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant sections of code. However, these links do not compensate for the lack of specific actionable changes that align with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of providing a full solution to the issue.",
