{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `PyOpenSSLContext.sendall` method in `urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl` for compatibility issues and proposes potential fixes involving the `memoryview` and buffer interface. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the `requests` library itself, specifically by ensuring that the HTTP method is converted to a native string after being uppercased. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the `requests` library and instead focuses on the `urllib3` library and the `memoryview` usage, which is not directly related to the git diff provided. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the traceback provided in the ISSUE, it does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative solution that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a low score for its limited relevance and lack of alignment with the git diff.",
