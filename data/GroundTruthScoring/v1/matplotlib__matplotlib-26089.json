{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to adding a public method to update the `Legend` object's `loc` property, which aligns with the issue's request for such a feature. It suggests creating a new public method `set_loc` and using the existing `_set_loc` method internally, which is a reasonable approach and partially aligns with the git diff's solution of refactoring the location setting code into a new `set_loc` method.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff. The git diff includes specific changes to the `Legend` class, such as adding documentation strings, raising specific exceptions, and handling outside legends, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces a `_update_legend_position` method, which is not present in the git diff and may not be necessary given the existing `_set_loc` method's functionality.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the task at hand, as they point to a hypothetical repository and files that do not exist. This inclusion does not provide actionable value and could potentially confuse the developer.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a partially correct approach but lacks the full detail and specificity found in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
