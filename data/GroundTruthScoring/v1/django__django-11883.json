    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice and partially matches the git diff by suggesting changes to the `delete` methods in various cache backend classes to return a boolean value. However, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary modifications to `delete_many` methods, which are not part of the git diff or the issue description. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests modifying the Redis backend, which is not present in the git diff and is not part of the original issue. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to a non-existent `make_and_validate_key` method instead of the correct `make_key` and `validate_key` methods. The RESPONSE does not mention the `dummy` and `filebased` backends, which are included in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks completeness and accuracy in matching the git diff, leading to a score of 4.",
