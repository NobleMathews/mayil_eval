    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `__getattr__` method in `baseframe.py` and implementing checks for custom properties in the subclass. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the issue of attribute access and error messaging, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `sky_coordinate.py` file, specifically in the `__getattr__` method of the `SkyCoord` class, where the error handling is modified to call `__getattribute__` instead of raising an `AttributeError`. The RESPONSE does not mention this file or the approach taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking for custom properties in the subclass, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, and it does not offer a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it scores a 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
