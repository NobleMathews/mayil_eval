    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and some specific implementation details that are partially aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `Nominal` scale class and provides actionable advice on disabling the grid display and adjusting axis limits, which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Nominal` scale class directly and adding a `_finalize` method, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows changes in the `plot.py` file, specifically in the `_finalize_figure` method, and does not modify the `Nominal` scale class directly. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the import statement for `Nominal` within the `_setup_scales` method, which is present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a section on adding an invisible artist with sticky edges, which is not part of the git diff and may not be necessary. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made.",
