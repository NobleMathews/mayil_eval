    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is with the `_print_Rational` method and that it should be modified to respect the `sympy_integers=True` setting. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `_print_Rational` method. Instead, the git diff shows modifications to various other methods within the `sympy/printing/str.py` file, where the `self._print` method is used to ensure that the settings are respected for different expressions. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves updating multiple print methods to use `self._print` for subexpressions. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies that there is an issue with the printing of expressions when certain settings are applied, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
