    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of allowing empty messages in Django management command stdout and stderr proxies. It suggests modifying the `write` method in the `OutputWrapper` class to handle an empty `msg` argument, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a default value for the `msg` parameter in the `write` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that the `ending` attribute is appended to the message if it's not already present, even when `msg` is empty, which is consistent with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE suggests setting `msg=None` as the default parameter and then checking for `None` to assign an empty string, which is a slight deviation from the git diff that directly sets `msg=''`. This alternative is still valid and achieves the same result, so it should not be penalized. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful but not necessary for the evaluation. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly but provides a valid and effective alternative solution, hence the score of 7.",
