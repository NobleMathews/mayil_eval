    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue. The git diff suggests a change in the colorbar.py file, specifically removing the autoscale_None() call from the __init__ method and adding a conditional autoscale_None() call in the _process_values() method, along with setting default vmin and vmax values if the norm is not scaled. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying the inverse method of the LogNorm class to handle values at or near zero, which is unrelated to the changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the core issue of updating the colorbar after changing the norm instance, which is what the git diff aims to resolve. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets and does not provide any actionable steps that would help in resolving the original issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and receives a score of 0.",
