    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests ensuring that the ordering parameter is correctly passed to the get_choices method call in both RelatedFieldListFilter and RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter, which is consistent with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the field_choices method to use model._meta.ordering if ordering is empty, which is in line with the git diff's approach to use the model admin's ordering or fall back to an empty tuple. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets that are relevant to the issue and the git diff, such as the field_admin_ordering method and the inclusion of the ordering parameter in the get_choices method call.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the field_admin_ordering method and the refactoring of the get_choices method in the fields/__init__.py and fields/reverse_related.py files. It also does not mention the specific changes to the RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter class that are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that would likely resolve the issue, it does not capture all the details of the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
