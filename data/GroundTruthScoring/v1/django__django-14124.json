    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `MyView` class to include a `dispatch` method that can handle different arguments for `handler500` and `handler404`, which is a reasonable approach to the problem described in the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which makes changes to the Django framework itself to handle class-based views more robustly. The RESPONSE also suggests updating `_check_custom_error_handlers` to correctly check for class-based views and their method signatures, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff modifies the `get_view_name`, `lookup_str`, and `technical_404_response` functions, as well as the `view` method in `django/views/generic/base.py`, to handle class-based views without requiring changes to the user's view classes or error handler checks. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes and instead proposes an alternative solution that involves user-level modifications. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results in the context of the Django framework's internal handling of class-based views.",
