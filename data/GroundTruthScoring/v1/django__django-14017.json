    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing the `__rand__` method in the `Exists` class to handle the case where it is on the right side of the `&` operator with a `Q` object. This is a reasonable approach to the problem described in the ISSUE, as it directly addresses the TypeError raised when `Q()` is combined with `Exists()` using the `&` operator in the reverse order.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided as the solution to the issue does not involve adding a `__rand__` method to the `Exists` class. Instead, the git diff modifies the `_combine` method in the `Q` class to allow it to accept an `other` object that has a `conditional` attribute set to `True`, which is the case for `Exists` objects.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion is somewhat relevant because it attempts to solve the commutativity problem between `Q` and `Exists` objects. However, it does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `_combine` method in the `Q` class. The RESPONSE's alternative solution could be a valid way to address the issue, but it is not the solution chosen in the git diff, and it is not clear if this alternative would be as effective or if it would introduce other issues.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it offers a somewhat relevant but alternative approach that does not closely match the git diff and may not be as effective in resolving the issue.",
