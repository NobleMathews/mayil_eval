    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting a correction to the migration script to reference the `default` method of the nested `Capability` class within the `Profile` class correctly. This aligns with the issue's description, which indicates that the migration script incorrectly references the `default` method, leading to an error during migration. However, the RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed in the serializer to fix the issue, as shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the serializer's code should use `__qualname__` instead of `__name__` to correctly serialize the reference to the class method from a nested class. The RESPONSE's suggestion to manually correct the migration script is a workaround rather than a fix to the underlying serialization problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not fully align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
