    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of validating the format of the `MANAGERS` setting in Django before sending emails. It suggests modifying the `mail_managers` function to include a check that ensures `MANAGERS` is a list of 2-tuples and raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception if the format is incorrect. This aligns closely with the git diff, which adds a similar validation check and raises a `ValueError` if the format is not as expected. The RESPONSE differs slightly from the git diff by suggesting the use of `ImproperlyConfigured` instead of `ValueError`. However, this does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as both exceptions serve the purpose of indicating a configuration error. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates the proposed changes, which is helpful for implementation. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code sections in the Django repository, which could assist the developer in locating the code that needs to be modified. The RESPONSE does not address the `mail_admins` function, which is also part of the git diff, hence the score is not a perfect 10.",
