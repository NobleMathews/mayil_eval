    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to change the storage of `ModelState.fields` from a list of tuples to a dictionary, which is the core of the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to update the `ModelState` class and its `__init__` method, as well as other parts of the codebase that interact with `ModelState.fields`. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating methods like `get_field` to work with the new dictionary structure.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff, which shows changes in various files where fields are now accessed as dictionary items instead of tuple pairs. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the `ModelState` class and related methods is consistent with the changes seen in the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention specific changes to other classes and methods such as `state_forwards` in the `fields.py` and `models.py` files, which are also part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE is comprehensive and provides a correct approach, it does not cover all the changes shown in the git diff, hence it does not receive a perfect score.",
