    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `SQLiteNumericMixin` class in `django/db/models/expressions.py` to handle boolean values in `JSONField` when using SQLite. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which instead modifies `django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py` and `django/db/models/fields/json.py` to address the issue with JSONField boolean values in SQLite.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed solution is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not offer a viable alternative to the changes made in the git diff. The git diff introduces a new `jsonfield_datatype_values` set and modifies the `as_sqlite` method and other related methods to handle the JSONField boolean values correctly. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide a similar solution.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes a large section of code snippets to check, which are not directly related to the actionable changes needed to fix the issue. This information does not provide additional value in resolving the specific issue described.\n\nBased on these points, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and therefore receives a score of 0.",
