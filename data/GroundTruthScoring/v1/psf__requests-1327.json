    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'get_adapter' method to sort the 'self.adapters' dictionary based on the length of the keys in descending order and then alphabetically for keys of the same length. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also aims to address the issue of the unpredictable order of adapters. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of using an OrderedDict to maintain the insertion order of adapters and updating the 'mount' method to ensure the correct order is maintained. Instead, it proposes sorting the adapters every time 'get_adapter' is called, which is not reflected in the git diff and could lead to performance issues. The RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the import statements or the reordering of the 'mount' method calls, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It offers a potential solution but does not align closely with the git diff's approach.",
