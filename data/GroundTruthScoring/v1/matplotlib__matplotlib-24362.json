    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `subplots` and `GridSpecBase.subplots` methods to accept `0` and `1` as valid values for `sharex` and `sharey`, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to handle boolean values correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or mention the need to update the list of valid values for `sharex` and `sharey` to include `False` and `True`, as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the error message and updating the documentation, which are good practices but are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for reference, which are not directly related to the fix but provide context for the usage of `sharex` and `sharey`. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is partially relevant to the git diff but lacks completeness in terms of the specific changes needed.",
