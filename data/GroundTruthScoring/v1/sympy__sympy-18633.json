    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the random number generation in the test to avoid zero values, and ensuring that `PartialDerivative` can handle zero values. While this is somewhat relevant to the issue of the test failing when a zero value is encountered, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff modifies the `TensExpr` class to handle cases where the expression is zero by returning `S.Zero`, and it also ensures that the expression is sympified before proceeding with the derivative operation. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes and instead focuses on the test setup and the handling of zero values in a more general sense. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
