    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests an alternative approach to the issue by separating the window function from the aggregate function and using a subquery. This is a valid workaround for the error encountered when using window functions in aggregates in PostgreSQL. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the Django ORM's internal handling of window functions in aggregates rather than changing the user's query structure. The git diff introduces a new variable `refs_window` to track the usage of window functions and adjusts the query's behavior accordingly, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the error message and provides a workaround, but it does not offer actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to modifying the Django ORM's internal query handling. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff and lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's solution.",
