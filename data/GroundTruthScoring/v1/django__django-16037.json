    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the `liked_by` field, verifying the `Count` aggregation, and reviewing Django release notes for backward-incompatible changes. While these are general good practices when debugging, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue is addressed by modifying the `get_group_by_cols` method in the `Subquery` class and handling `EmptyResultSet` exceptions in the `get_group_by` method of the SQL compiler. The RESPONSE does not mention these changes or similar solutions. It does not address the core issue of the subquery returning more columns than expected, which is resolved in the git diff by modifying the internal Django methods to handle the subquery results correctly. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
