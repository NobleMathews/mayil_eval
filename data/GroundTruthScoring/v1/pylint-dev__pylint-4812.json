    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable instructions that closely align with the git diff. It correctly identifies the file and method where the change should be made, and it specifies the exact code change needed to fix the issue, which matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a reminder to ensure the 'os' module is imported, which is a helpful note, although the git diff does not indicate a change to the import statements. The only minor discrepancy is the mention of the method name 'load_config_file' instead of 'read_config_file' as shown in the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the developer can still locate the correct method based on the file and line number provided. The RESPONSE also includes a link to related code snippets, which could be useful for understanding the context but is not directly related to the fix. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
