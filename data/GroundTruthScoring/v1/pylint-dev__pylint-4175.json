    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the configuration and checking the `Similar` class for issues related to the `min-similarity-lines` setting. However, the git diff provided shows a change in the `parallel.py` file, specifically in the `_merge_stats` function, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change in the git diff, which involves merging the stats from parallel linting processes. Instead, it focuses on the similarity checker logic, which is not the subject of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader issue of the `min-similarity-lines` setting not being respected, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
