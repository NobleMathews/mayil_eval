    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to modify the `pluralize` filter to handle invalid inputs by returning an empty string, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE suggests removing `isinstance` checks and using a `try/except` block to handle objects with a length, which is also in line with the git diff's removal of explicit type checks and the use of exception handling to determine if the value has a length.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed code changes are similar to the git diff, with the exception of the specific implementation details. The RESPONSE suggests using a `try/except` block to handle both `ValueError` and `TypeError`, and then another `try/except` block to handle the length check, which is a slightly different structure than the git diff but achieves the same result.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `test_pluralize_error` test case should pass with the updated `pluralize` function, which is an important aspect of verifying the fix.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach. It does not match the git diff exactly in terms of code structure, but the differences do not affect the effectiveness of the solution. Therefore, a score of 8 is appropriate.",
