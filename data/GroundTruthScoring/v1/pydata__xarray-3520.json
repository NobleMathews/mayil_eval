    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the concatenation and indexing code in the user's example, which is not related to the actual problem in the software repository. The git diff indicates that changes were made to the internal implementation of the `set_index` method in the `DataArray` class and the `merge_indexes` function in the `Dataset` class, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests using `dims` instead of `xy` as the keyword argument, which is not supported by the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE also provides incorrect code snippets and references to code lines that are not relevant to the issue. There is no actionable guidance provided that would help the developer fix the issue based on the git diff.",
