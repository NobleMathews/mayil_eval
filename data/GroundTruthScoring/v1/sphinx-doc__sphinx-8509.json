    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the 'default_latex_engine' function in 'sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py' to return 'uplatex' for Japanese language configurations, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE goes further by suggesting additional checks and updates that might be necessary, such as ensuring 'uplatex' is correctly configured in 'constants.py' and updating the 'install_packages_for_ja' function if needed. These suggestions are not directly reflected in the git diff but are relevant and could be necessary for a complete implementation of the feature request. The RESPONSE also correctly advises testing the changes with a Japanese document, which is a good practice but not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly contradict the git diff and provides a comprehensive approach to implementing the requested feature.",
