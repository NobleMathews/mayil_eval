    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `StringIO` object is seeked to the beginning before passing it to `requests.post` by calling `s.seek(0)`. This is a valid workaround for the issue described but does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `super_len` function to correctly calculate the length of the data being sent, regardless of the current position of the file-like object. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the `requests` library, which is what the git diff aims to fix. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to understanding the issue, but it does not offer any actionable changes to the codebase that would prevent the issue from occurring in the future. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff.",
