    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice and partially match the git diff but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the 'values_select' attribute of the 'query' object is updated correctly after a 'union()' operation, which is aligned with the issue described. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the logic in 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' to reflect the latest state of the 'query' object after a 'union()' operation. However, the RESPONSE does not specifically mention cloning the 'query' object before setting the 'values_select', which is a key part of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a broad range of lines (556 to 1141) to check, which is not as precise as the git diff's specific modification. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides some actionable advice but lacks the precision and full alignment with the git diff.",
