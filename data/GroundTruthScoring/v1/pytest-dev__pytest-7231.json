    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of logging failures not causing test runs to fail.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `func` function to use the correct number of arguments for the format string in the `logging.error` call and modifying `test_func` to assert that no exception is raised when calling `func`. However, this does not align with the git diff, which introduces changes to the logging handlers to raise an exception when a logging error occurs, thereby causing the test to fail. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the logging system needing to fail the test when a logging error occurs, and instead focuses on correcting the logging call and testing for exceptions, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
