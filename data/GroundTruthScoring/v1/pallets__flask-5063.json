    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of displaying domain/subdomain information in the Flask routes command. It suggests modifying the `routes_command` function, updating the headers and rows to include domain or subdomain information, and adjusting the template string to accommodate the new column. This aligns well with the git diff, which also modifies the `routes_command` function to include domain/subdomain information in the output. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests using `SERVER_NAME` as a fallback, which is not present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's approach is still relevant and would achieve the desired result of displaying domain/subdomain information. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure the sorting functionality works with the new column, which is consistent with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE does not include the exact code changes from the git diff, such as the use of `itemgetter` for sorting and the specific handling of `host_matching`, which prevents it from scoring higher. Nonetheless, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and would assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
