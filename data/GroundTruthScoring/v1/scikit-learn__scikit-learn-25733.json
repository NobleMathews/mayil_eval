    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests applying the `deprecated` decorator to the `GMMBayes` class to issue a `FutureWarning` when the class is instantiated. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about ensuring that a `FutureWarning` is issued for a deprecated class. However, the RESPONSE does not address the core of the issue, which is the need to modify the `__new__` method in the `deprecated` decorator to ensure that the warning is issued even when the `__init__` method is not called directly. The git diff provided shows that the fix involves changing the `__init__` wrapping to `__new__` wrapping within the `deprecated` decorator, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
