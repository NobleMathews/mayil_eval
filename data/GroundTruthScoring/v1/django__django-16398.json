    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to use `partial` from the `functools` module to maintain the context of the `local_setter` and `remote_setter` functions, which is the core of the issue described. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `local_setter` and `remote_setter` functions to use `partial`, which is exactly what the git diff does by adding `partial(local_setter, final_field)` and `partial(remote_setter, name)`.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by providing guidance on reviewing the `select_related` implementation and testing the changes, which are important steps but not explicitly shown in the git diff. It also includes links to code snippets, which are not part of the git diff but are helpful for the developer to locate the relevant sections of the code.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it provides a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that `partial` is used correctly aligns with the git diff's approach of using `partial` to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
