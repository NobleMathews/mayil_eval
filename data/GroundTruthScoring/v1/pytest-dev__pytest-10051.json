{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align closely with the git diff. It suggests reviewing the implementation of `caplog.get_records()` and `caplog.clear()`, which is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that `caplog.clear()` resets the state correctly, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff where a new `clear()` method is added to the `LogCaptureHandler` class and the `clear()` method in the `LogCaptureFixture` class is updated to call `handler.clear()` instead of `handler.reset()`.\n\nThe RESPONSE advises modifying the `caplog.clear()` method to reset the internal list of records, which is exactly what the git diff does by clearing the records and resetting the stream. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` retrieves records based on the updated state after `caplog.clear()` is invoked is addressed by the git diff's changes to the `clear()` method.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE recommends adding a test case to verify the behavior after calling `caplog.clear()`, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. This does not detract from the RESPONSE's value, as it is a logical step to ensure the fix works as intended.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the removal of an empty line in the git diff, which is not key to the issue, and therefore does not affect the score. The RESPONSE receives an 8 because it provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and achieves similar results, though it does not directly match every aspect of the git diff.",
