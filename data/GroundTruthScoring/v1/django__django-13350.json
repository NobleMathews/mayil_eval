    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of temporary files not being deleted on canceled upload requests.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `handle_file_complete` method and adding a check in the `except StopUpload as e:` block to handle cleanup of temporary files. It also recommends implementing a cleanup function and updating the `TemporaryUploadedFile.close` method. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of handling temporary files, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows the introduction of a new method `upload_interrupted` in the `FileUploadHandler` class and its implementation in the `TemporaryFileUploadHandler` subclass to handle the deletion of temporary files. Additionally, the git diff modifies the `parse` method in `multipartparser.py` to call `handler.upload_interrupted()` when an upload is not completed. The RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of the `upload_interrupted` method or the changes to the `parse` method, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
