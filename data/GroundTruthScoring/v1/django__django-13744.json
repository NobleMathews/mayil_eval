{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed step-by-step guide on how to deprecate the `MemcachedCache` backend in Django, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE correctly suggests adding a deprecation warning in the `__init__` method of the `MemcachedCache` class, which matches the git diff's approach of issuing a deprecation warning. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the correct warning message and the use of `DeprecationWarning` with the appropriate `stacklevel`. The RESPONSE also advises updating the documentation, communicating the change, and testing the changes, which are all relevant to the deprecation process but are not directly reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific `RemovedInDjango41Warning` used in the git diff, but this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE is actionable, relevant, and closely aligns with the git diff, providing a clear path for deprecating the `MemcachedCache` backend.",
