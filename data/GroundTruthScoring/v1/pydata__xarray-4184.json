    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance or relevant solutions to the issue described. It suggests profiling and optimizing the `to_xarray()` method, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific code changes to the `xarray` library, including modifications to the `_set_sparse_data_from_dataframe` and `_set_numpy_data_from_dataframe` methods, as well as changes to the `remove_unused_levels_categories` function. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these changes or provide similar solutions. Instead, it offers a generic approach to profiling and optimizing without any specific details or code examples. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not pertain to the actual changes required to address the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff and should receive a score of 0.",
