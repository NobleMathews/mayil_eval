    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of updating jQuery to a non-vulnerable version. It correctly identifies the need to update the jQuery version in the `astropy/extern/jquery/data/js` directory and to modify the `astropy/table/jsviewer.py` configuration to point to the updated jQuery version. The RESPONSE suggests updating to jQuery version 3.5.0 or newer, which is in line with the issue's request for an update to version 3.5 or newer. The git diff shows an update to version 3.6.0, which is within the range of acceptable versions mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by suggesting a security audit to identify and sanitize any usage of `.html()` or `.append()` methods that handle untrusted HTML content, which is a relevant and valuable recommendation given the nature of the security issue. It also advises ensuring that the updated jQuery version does not introduce breaking changes, which is a prudent step in the update process.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score is that it does not explicitly mention updating the local file paths to the new jQuery version as shown in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
