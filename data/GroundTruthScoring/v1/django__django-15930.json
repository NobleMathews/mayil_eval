    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the error message and the incorrect SQL syntax but fails to provide a solution that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the 'When' object within the 'Case' statement has a valid condition and that the condition should not be an empty 'Q()' object. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the 'as_sql' method in the 'expressions.py' file to handle cases where the condition matches everything, by compiling 'Value(True)' when 'condition_sql' is an empty string. The RESPONSE does not address this specific fix and instead provides general advice on checking the 'When' condition and the possibility of removing the 'When' condition entirely, which does not align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for further investigation, but these do not provide actionable steps to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
