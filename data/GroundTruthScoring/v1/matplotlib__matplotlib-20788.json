    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the alpha array `zalpha` has the same shape as the `z` data array or passing a scalar value if `zalpha` is intended to be a scalar. This advice does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `set_alpha` method to handle array-like alphas properly by setting `self.alpha` to `None` if an array is provided. The RESPONSE fails to address the changes made in the git diff and instead provides guidance that is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets that are not part of the solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
