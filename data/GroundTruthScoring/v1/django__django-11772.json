    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the MD5 hashing function with SHA256 for FIPS compliance, which does not align with the git diff that retains the use of MD5. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to remove the use of `urllib.quote` and to update the `make_template_fragment_key` function to use the `hashlib.update()` method directly with the `vary_on` arguments, which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide the correct implementation as per the git diff, which continues to use MD5 instead of SHA256. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a significant amount of information regarding updating tests, documentation, and reviewing pull requests, which, while potentially useful, is not directly related to the code changes required to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for review, which are not part of the git diff and do not directly assist in resolving the issue at hand. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but does not closely match the git diff and includes extraneous information not pertinent to the specific code changes needed.",
