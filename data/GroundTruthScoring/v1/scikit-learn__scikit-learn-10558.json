    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to deprecating the `axis` parameter from the `Imputer` class, which aligns with the issue's goal. It suggests adding a deprecation warning, setting the default value of `axis` to `None`, and updating the documentation, which are relevant steps. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made to the code. The git diff shows the actual deprecation warning messages, the change of the default value of `axis` to `None`, and the handling of the `axis` parameter within the class methods, including the use of a private `_axis` attribute to maintain functionality until removal. The RESPONSE does not mention the use of a private attribute or the specific warning messages, and it incorrectly refers to `SimpleImputer` instead of `Imputer`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary details about checking code snippets that are not directly related to the issue or the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue, warranting a score within the 4-6 range.",
