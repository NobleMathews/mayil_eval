    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the Deserializer function to handle None values for field_value when deserializing ManyToMany fields, which is relevant to the issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to change the iteration over field_value to include a default empty list if field_value is None to prevent the 'NoneType' object is not iterable error. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which introduces a try-except block to handle TypeError and uses an iterator for field_value. The RESPONSE suggests a different approach by directly checking if field_value is None and setting it to an empty list, which is a valid alternative but not the same as the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to ensure that the 'pk' variable is properly initialized, which is not directly related to the changes in the git diff but is still relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete in terms of the specific implementation details provided in the git diff.",
