    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue described, which is that the ManagementUtility.fetch_command function incorrectly prints \"No Django settings specified.\" even when settings are configured via a UserSettingsHolder. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `fetch_command` function to check `settings.configured` before accessing `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding an `elif not settings.configured:` check. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the check for `os.environ.get(\"DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE\")` is not reliable and should be removed, which is consistent with the issue description. The RESPONSE goes further to suggest exiting the program with a non-zero status code if `settings.configured` is `False`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff but is a reasonable action to take in case of misconfiguration. The RESPONSE is comprehensive and provides the complete updated function, which is helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes the additional step of exiting the program, which, while reasonable, is not part of the diff provided.",
