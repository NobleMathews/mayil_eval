    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to set 'self._for_write = True' before the 'transaction.atomic' block, which is in line with the git diff provided. This change ensures that 'self.db' refers to the correct database alias for write operations, addressing the core issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests using 'router.db_for_write(self.model)' to get the correct database alias for write operations. While this is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff, it is a valid approach to ensure that the correct database alias is used for write operations and does not contradict the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a detailed code snippet that reflects the necessary changes, including setting 'self._for_write = True' and using 'self.using(db)' to create a queryset with the correct database alias. This closely matches the git diff's approach of using 'queryset = self.using(self.db)' after setting 'self._for_write = True'.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional changes and code that are not present in the git diff, such as the 'abulk_update' method and the import statements. These changes are not directly related to the issue at hand and thus do not contribute to the score. The RESPONSE also does not mention the change in the git diff where 'rows_updated += queryset.filter(pk__in=pks).update(**update_kwargs)' replaces 'rows_updated += self.filter(pk__in=pks).update(**update_kwargs)', which is a key part of the solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative approach to the issue and includes most of the key elements from the git diff, but it is not a perfect match due to the inclusion of unrelated changes and missing the specific change in the update statement.",
