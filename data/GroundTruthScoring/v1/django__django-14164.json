    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of making the `to_locale` function idempotent. It suggests checking if the language is already in locale format and returning it as is, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to prevent reprocessing of a locale-formatted string. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `to_locale` function and provides a code snippet that would likely resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it introduces an additional check for an underscore in the language string, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the effectiveness of the solution and could be considered a valid alternative approach to achieving idempotency. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that the `override` function uses `to_locale` correctly, which is relevant but not directly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide changes to the `override` function itself, which is appropriate given that the issue description does not indicate problems with `override`. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a solution that would likely resolve the issue, albeit with a slightly different approach than the git diff.",
