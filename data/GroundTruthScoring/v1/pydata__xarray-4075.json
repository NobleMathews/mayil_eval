    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the weighted mean calculation when using boolean weights and provides a solution that aligns closely with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_sum_of_weights` method to handle boolean weights by converting them to an integer type before computing the sum, which is consistent with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that closely resembles the git diff, with the addition of using `duck_array_ops.astype` for type conversion, which is a reasonable alternative to the direct `astype` call in the git diff. This alternative approach is valid and would achieve the same result as the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional context and links to code snippets that, while potentially useful for understanding the broader context, are not directly related to the specific changes needed to fix the issue. This additional information does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE but does not contribute to its alignment with the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue, closely matching the git diff's solution.",
