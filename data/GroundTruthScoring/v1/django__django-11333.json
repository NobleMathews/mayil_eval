    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of the changes needed to address the issue described, which is to prevent the construction of multiple URLResolver instances and unnecessary calls to URLResolver._populate. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_resolver` function to use `settings.ROOT_URLCONF` before calling the memoized `_get_cached_resolver` function, which aligns with the git diff's approach of introducing a `_get_cached_resolver` function and using it within `get_resolver`. The RESPONSE also correctly advises the use of the `lru_cache` decorator to cache the resolver, which is consistent with the git diff's application of `lru_cache` to `_get_cached_resolver`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that closely matches the git diff's changes, with the correct use of `lru_cache` and the new `_get_cached_resolver` function. The RESPONSE also provides relevant links to the codebase for context and suggests running the Django test suite to ensure no regressions, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the change in `django/urls/base.py` where `get_resolver.cache_clear()` is replaced with `_get_cached_resolver.cache_clear()`, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
