    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described, nor does it align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests verifying the use of the `where_not_allclose` function and ensuring that `rtol` and `atol` are correctly passed to `np.allclose`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not offer actionable steps that match the git diff's approach of modifying the `report_diff_values` function to include `rtol` and `atol` parameters and adjusting the calls to this function within `astropy/io/fits/diff.py` to pass these parameters. The RESPONSE also suggests checking data types and confirming that `report_diff_values` considers `rtol` and `atol`, which is aligned with the git diff's changes. However, it lacks the specific actionable guidance provided by the git diff, such as the exact code changes needed. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
