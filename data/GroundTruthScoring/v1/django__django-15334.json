    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code example that aligns closely with the git diff, offering clear guidance on how to implement support for `prefetch_related()` with `Queryset.iterator()`. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `iterator` method to handle prefetching of related objects for each chunk of results, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that `chunk_size` is provided when `prefetch_related` is used, and to use the `prefetch_related_objects` function for prefetching, which matches the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE includes a rough implementation that is similar to the git diff, using `islice` to fetch chunks of results and `prefetch_related_objects` for prefetching. The RESPONSE also provides a list of code snippets to check, which are relevant to the issue and the changes being made.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE's suggested changes to the `iterator` and `_iterator` methods are in line with the git diff, including the use of `islice` and `prefetch_related_objects`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need for a `chunk_size` parameter and the deprecation warning for using `iterator()` after `prefetch_related()` without specifying `chunk_size`, which is also present in the git diff. The RESPONSE's code example is similar to the git diff's solution, with minor differences in implementation details that do not affect the overall approach. The RESPONSE's list of code snippets to check is comprehensive and relevant to understanding the context of the changes and ensuring compatibility with other parts of the Django framework.",
