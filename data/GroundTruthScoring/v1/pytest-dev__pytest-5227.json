    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to improve the default logging format by including the module name, which aligns with the git diff's change to the DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT string to include `%(name)s`, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes further by offering an optional step to include the relative path, which is not part of the git diff but is mentioned as a potential improvement in the ISSUE description. The RESPONSE also provides an example implementation using a custom formatter to handle relative paths and virtual environment substitution, which is a viable solution to the issue raised. However, the git diff does not include changes related to handling the relative path or virtual environment substitution, which is why the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional suggestions that are not reflected in the git diff.",
