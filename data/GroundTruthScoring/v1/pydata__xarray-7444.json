    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that partially matches the git diff and is somewhat relevant to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing test cases and removing or replacing deprecated keyword arguments, which is relevant to the issue of deprecated arguments in pandas causing test failures. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to replace the deprecated arguments or address the changes in the xarray codebase as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE mentions ensuring compatibility with pandas version specified in CI environment files, which is somewhat relevant but does not directly address the changes needed in the xarray codebase. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of warnings or the refactoring of the resampling logic, which are key aspects of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue.",
