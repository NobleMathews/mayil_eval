    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of allowing migrations directories without __init__.py files. It correctly identifies the need to remove the check for the `__file__` attribute and to use `pkgutil.iter_modules()` for migration file discovery. The provided code snippet aligns well with the git diff, which also removes the check for `__file__` and adds a condition to handle namespace packages by checking if `module.__file__` is None. The RESPONSE suggests using `module.__path__` for migration names, which is consistent with the git diff's use of `pkgutil.iter_modules(module.__path__)`. The RESPONSE does not include the addition of `self.migrated_apps.add(app_config.label)` outside of the conditional blocks, which is present in the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is addressed effectively. The RESPONSE also correctly advises not to make changes to other code snippets that are not relevant to the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
