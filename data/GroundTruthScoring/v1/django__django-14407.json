    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the TEMPLATES configuration, examining the changes made in the pull request, overriding or extending the watch_for_template_changes signal receiver, creating a custom management command, and ensuring the runserver command is not contributing to the issue. While these suggestions are somewhat related to the issue of the dev server reloading on template changes, they do not align with the git diff provided, which specifically modifies the get_template_directories function in autoreload.py to update the way template directories are handled.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention modifying the get_template_directories function or using the Path and to_path utilities from the pathlib and django.utils._os modules, respectively, which are key elements in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on configuration and potential overrides that are not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it offers some general advice on where to look for potential issues and how to debug them, but it does not provide specific, actionable steps that would help resolve the issue in the same way as the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
