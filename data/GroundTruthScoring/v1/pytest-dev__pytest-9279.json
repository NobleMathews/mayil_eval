    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat relevant to the issue. It suggests updating the `from_parent` method calls for `BlackItem` and `CheckdocsItem` to match the updated pytest API and to remove or update the `path` keyword argument. This aligns with the issue's description, which involves a `TypeError` due to an unexpected keyword argument 'path'.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which involves modifying the `__init__` method of a class in the `_pytest/nodes.py` file to accept positional arguments instead of keyword arguments for `name` and `parent`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to update the `from_parent` method calls and to ensure compatibility with the pytest version is related to the issue but does not reflect the specific solution provided in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a reference to code snippets from a configuration file, which is not directly related to the issue at hand. This part of the RESPONSE does not provide value in resolving the TypeError and is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as partially relevant and actionable but incomplete in addressing the git diff's approach.",
