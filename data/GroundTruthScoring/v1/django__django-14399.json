    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance or solutions that align with the git diff or achieve similar results in addressing the issue of serving static files with Hypercorn.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed guide on how to configure Django to serve static files using WhiteNoise when deploying with an ASGI server like Hypercorn. It includes steps for configuring Django settings, wrapping the ASGI application with WhiteNoise, and ensuring proper Nginx setup for serving static files.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided does not relate to the issue of serving static files with Hypercorn. Instead, the git diff is about adding a deprecation warning for the USE_TZ setting in Django's configuration system, which is unrelated to the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the git diff's content and does not provide an alternative solution to the specific deprecation warning implementation. Therefore, it does not offer any actionable guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue that the git diff is intended to fix.",
