    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `set_cookie` method to handle `datetime.timedelta` objects for the `max_age` parameter by converting them to seconds using the `total_seconds()` method. This matches the git diff's approach of adding a check for `datetime.timedelta` and converting it to seconds. The RESPONSE also correctly states that no changes are needed for the `set_signed_cookie` method, as it relies on `set_cookie`, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the additional validation logic introduced in the git diff to raise a `ValueError` if both `expires` and `max_age` are used together, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE's guidance is highly relevant and would lead to a similar outcome as the git diff, hence the high score.",
