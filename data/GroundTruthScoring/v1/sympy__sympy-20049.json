    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `v2pt_theory` method to set the velocity of point `Q` in reference frame `A`, which is a valid approach in the context of Sympy's mechanics module. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which implements an automatic calculation of velocity within the `vel` method itself, without requiring the user to manually invoke `v2pt_theory` or any other method.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the core issue described, which is the automatic calculation of velocity when it is possible, based on the relative positions and velocities of points. Instead, it provides an alternative method for setting the velocity that requires additional steps from the user.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses velocity calculation in the context of Sympy's mechanics module, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide guidance on modifying the `vel` method to automatically calculate velocity, which is the solution presented in the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it offers a somewhat relevant alternative approach but does not provide actionable advice that closely matches the git diff or addresses the specific issue of automatic velocity calculation.",
