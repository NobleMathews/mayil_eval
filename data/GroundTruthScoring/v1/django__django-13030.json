    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_filter_prefetch_queryset` function in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` to filter out `None` values from the `instances` list. This is a different file and function than the one modified in the GIT DIFF, which alters the `process_rhs` method in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. While the RESPONSE's suggestion could potentially prevent `NULL` values from being passed to the database, it does not align with the GIT DIFF's approach of handling the issue within the `process_rhs` method itself.\n\nThe RESPONSE does address the issue of avoiding `NULL` in the `IN` clause, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. However, it does not provide a solution that aligns with the GIT DIFF's changes. The RESPONSE's alternative solution is not directly supported by the GIT DIFF, but it is not entirely irrelevant either, as it attempts to solve the same problem from a different angle. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 for offering a somewhat relevant but not aligned alternative solution.",
