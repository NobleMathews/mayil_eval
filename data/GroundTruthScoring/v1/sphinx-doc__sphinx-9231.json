    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting the `man_make_section_directory` configuration option to `False` in the Sphinx configuration file, which is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not address the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `write` method of the `manpage.py` file, where it modifies the directory structure for man pages when `man_make_section_directory` is enabled. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `write` method or the directory naming convention, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying installation scripts for `fish-shell` and `llvm-project`, which is not related to the changes in the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue within the Sphinx repository. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the configuration option, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not provide a solution for the issue described.",
