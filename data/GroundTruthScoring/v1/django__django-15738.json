    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a two-step migration process that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The first step involves removing the unique_together constraint, and the second step changes the ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField. This is in line with the git diff, which suggests that adding a field always depends at least on its removal, implying a step-by-step approach to migration.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to adjust dependencies to ensure the migrations are applied in the correct order, which is a crucial aspect of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests considering a data migration to preserve existing data, which is a relevant consideration for the issue at hand, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippet checks from various unrelated migrations in the Django project, which do not contribute to solving the issue. These snippets do not align with the git diff and do not provide additional value in addressing the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not scored a perfect 10, as it includes extraneous information that does not directly contribute to resolving the issue.",
