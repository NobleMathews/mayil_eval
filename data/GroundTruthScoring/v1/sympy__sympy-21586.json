    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some general advice on using the `parse_expr` function with the correct transformations and local dictionary, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not address the specific problem described in the issue, which is related to the unexpected behavior when parsing expressions with implicit multiplication and a local dictionary containing a symbol definition for 'x'. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by modifying the `sympy_parser.py` file to handle cases where the name is already defined in the local dictionary and should not be converted, as well as restoring neutral definitions for names in the local dictionary after evaluation. The RESPONSE does not mention or address these specific changes or the underlying problem. Therefore, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the specific issue described.",
