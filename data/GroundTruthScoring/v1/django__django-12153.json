    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to handle the absence of a default database in the migration script and suggests modifying the script to pass the database alias to the `transaction.atomic()` and `Permission.objects.using(alias)` calls, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also offers additional advice on ensuring the `settings.DATABASES` configuration is correct, which is a reasonable step to take when troubleshooting database-related issues in Django, although this part is not directly related to the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not provide the specific code changes made in the git diff, but it does suggest a similar approach to solving the problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
