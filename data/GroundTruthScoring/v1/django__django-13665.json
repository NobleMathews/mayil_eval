    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests defining a new `base_manager` in the `Service` model and modifying various functions to use this `base_manager`. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which simply changes the `serialize_db_to_string` function to use `model._base_manager` instead of `model._default_manager`. The RESPONSE does not address the specific change in the git diff and instead proposes a different solution that involves more extensive changes to the codebase. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff, as it does not achieve the same result with an alternate approach. Therefore, it does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
