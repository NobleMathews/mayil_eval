    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the correct use of the `Extract` function and the structure of the `hour_aggregates` dictionary, as well as checking for known bugs in Django and updating to a newer version if necessary. While these are general good practices, they do not provide a specific solution to the issue described. The RESPONSE does not address the core problem of the ProgrammingError caused by the missing column alias in the SQL query, which is what the git diff aims to fix. The git diff provides a detailed code change in the Django ORM layer to handle the aliasing of columns and annotations correctly, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests checking code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff's changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the general area of the problem (use of `Extract` and `aggregate`) but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
