    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the precision of floating-point arithmetic in the `sqrt` function and recommends checking the implementation of `isqrt` and `integer_nthroot` functions in `sympy/core/power.py`. However, the git diff indicates that the actual issue was in the `factorint` function in `sympy/ntheory/factor_.py`, where the factors dictionary was not being updated correctly. The RESPONSE does not address the correct file or the logic that was changed in the git diff, and therefore does not provide any actionable guidance that would help resolve the issue described. The RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful or misguided, offering no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
