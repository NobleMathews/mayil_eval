    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `format` function to handle floats in scientific notation by converting them to a `Decimal` with a high precision to avoid scientific notation. This approach is similar to the git diff, which also converts the float to a `Decimal` if it's in scientific notation. The RESPONSE goes further by suggesting setting the `getcontext().prec` to a high value, which is not present in the git diff but is a valid alternative approach to ensure that the number is not represented in scientific notation. The RESPONSE also correctly mentions the use of `decimal_pos` to round the `Decimal` number to the correct number of decimal places, which aligns with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests setting the precision explicitly, which is not part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match but still provides a viable and effective alternative solution to the issue.",
