    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `floatformat` function to handle a precision argument of `0` correctly, which aligns with the git diff that changes the condition from `p < 0` to `p <= 0`. This change is directly related to the issue of `floatformat` crashing when passed a precision of `0`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the function should not raise a `ValueError` when `prec` is `0`, which is consistent with the git diff's intent to fix the error handling.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting an update to the condition to allow `p == 0` as a valid precision value, which is effectively what the git diff does by changing the condition to `p <= 0`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a recommendation to adjust the calculation of `prec` to have a minimum value of `1`, which is a reasonable interpretation of how to handle the case when `p == 0`, although this specific change is not shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to the relevant code snippets, which could help the developer locate the function and understand the context of the changes needed. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change as the git diff does, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
