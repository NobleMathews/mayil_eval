    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring proper formatting of the `help` attribute in the `Command` class and using triple quotes to maintain formatting. It also recommends checking the method that outputs the help text and using textwrap.dedent if necessary. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of formatting help text, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves setting a default formatter class for the argument parser in the Django management command framework. The RESPONSE does not address this aspect of the solution at all. It does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue, which is to set the `formatter_class` at the point of parser creation with `kwargs.setdefault`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks the actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
