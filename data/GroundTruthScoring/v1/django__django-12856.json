    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement a system check for fields specified in `UniqueConstraint` to ensure they exist on the model. It correctly identifies that the check should be implemented in the `Model._check_constraints` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which aligns with the git diff's location for the changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests iterating over `cls._meta.constraints` and checking each `UniqueConstraint` for field existence, which is similar to the git diff's approach of creating a generator expression to collect fields from `UniqueConstraint` instances. However, the RESPONSE goes further by providing an example implementation that includes error handling using a try-except block, which is not present in the git diff. This additional detail is helpful and relevant, although not strictly necessary given the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises appending an `Error` to the `errors` list with an appropriate error message and `id`, which is consistent with the git diff's intent to extend the `errors` list with checks.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure the check is performed before running migrations by including it in the `Model.check` method is a valid point, but it is not directly addressed in the git diff. This does not detract from the RESPONSE's value, as it is a relevant consideration for the developer.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a clear, actionable, and highly relevant solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It offers a slightly different but effective approach to achieving the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's implementation but provides a valid, alternative method that would resolve the issue effectively.",
