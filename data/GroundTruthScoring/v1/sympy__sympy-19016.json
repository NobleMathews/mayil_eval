    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing the `is_finite_set` property in the `Range` class, which aligns with the issue's requirement. However, the proposed implementation checks if `start` and `stop` are finite and if `step` is not zero, which is different from the git diff's approach that checks if `start` and `stop` are integers or if the size is finite. This alternative could be considered valid, but it does not match the git diff's solution and may not handle all cases correctly, such as when `start` and `stop` are not integers but the range is still finite.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional suggestions for handling symbolic integers in the `_inf` and `_sup` properties and the `size` property, which were not part of the original issue or the git diff. These suggestions are not directly relevant to the issue at hand and introduce complexity that was not requested or addressed in the git diff.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE includes a modification to the `__new__` method to handle symbolic integers, which is again outside the scope of the original issue and the git diff. While these additional suggestions may be valuable in a broader context, they do not align with the specific issue of implementing the `is_finite_set` property for the `Range` class.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information regarding the implementation of the `is_finite_set` property but includes additional changes that are not aligned with the git diff and the specific issue described. Therefore, it only partially addresses the issue and does not closely match the git diff's approach.",
