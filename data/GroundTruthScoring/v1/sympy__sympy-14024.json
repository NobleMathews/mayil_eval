    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue, recognizing the inconsistency when simplifying expressions of the form `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` and the need for the simplification logic to handle cases where `a` is a positive integer and `x` is a symbolic exponent. However, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable changes that align with the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the `_eval_power` method in the `numbers.py` file, which simplifies the logic for handling negative exponents. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying the simplification rules and adding checks for integer exponents without providing concrete code changes or referencing the correct part of the codebase. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests that the issue might be within a function like `simplify` and provides a code snippet that does not correspond to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly states that `(-a)**x * a**(-x)` simplifies to `1` for positive `a` and real `x`, which is not always the case and is not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the nature of the issue but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, thus warranting a score of 2.",
