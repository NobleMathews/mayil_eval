    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing models with the same name to ensure they have unique `related_name` attributes or removing `related_name='+'` if not needed, which is a general good practice but does not address the specific issue of the error being raised during migration. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that non-reversible relationships do not cause clashes, which is related to the issue but does not provide a concrete solution. The suggestion to rename models or define a `related_query_name` is not aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `related_name` generation to include the app label, class name, and field name to avoid clashes. The RESPONSE does not suggest modifying the Django source code, which is what the git diff does. The code snippet provided is a helpful reference but does not offer a solution. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff.",
