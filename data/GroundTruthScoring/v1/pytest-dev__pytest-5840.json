    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the `conftest.py` file's name and location, checking for incorrect import statements, correcting hardcoded paths, reverting to a previous pytest version, comparing release notes, and ensuring compatibility with the file system's case sensitivity. While these are general troubleshooting steps for import errors, they do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by removing the `unique_path` function and using `Path().resolve()` to handle case-insensitive file systems correctly. The RESPONSE does not mention anything about removing `unique_path` or using `Path().resolve()`, nor does it address the specific changes to the path handling in the pytest configuration code. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant as it addresses the ImportError in a general sense but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
