    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is relevant to the issue described, such as modifying the `CheckConstraint` to avoid conditions that span across tables and implementing cross-table validation at the application level. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `_get_expr_references` method and the detailed logic to check for references in constraints that could span joins. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer, but it does not provide the necessary guidance on how to implement the changes reflected in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue.",
