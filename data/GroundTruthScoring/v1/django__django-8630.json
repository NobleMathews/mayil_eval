{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests adding a `next_page` attribute to the `LoginView` class and modifying the `get_default_redirect_url` method to return the `next_page` if it is set, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly advises ensuring that the `next_page` is a safe URL, which is an important consideration for security. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on how to update `urls.py` and how to initialize the `LoginView` with the `next_page` parameter, which, while not directly reflected in the git diff, is relevant and useful for the implementation of the feature. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the removal of the line `url = self.get_redirect_url()` and replacing it with `return self.get_redirect_url() or self.get_default_redirect_url()`, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff, while providing a comprehensive solution to the issue.",
