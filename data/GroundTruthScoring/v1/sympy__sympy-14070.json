    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the implementation of `logcombine` and ensuring it handles the subtraction of logarithms correctly, which is relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide any specific actionable guidance or code changes that would resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows specific changes to the `logcombine` function, including the addition of `evaluate=False` to prevent automatic evaluation during the combination process. The RESPONSE fails to mention the need to prevent automatic evaluation, which is a key aspect of the git diff's solution to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the function and the type of issue but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
