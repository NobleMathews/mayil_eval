    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it. The RESPONSE should address the specific issue described and be relevant to the context of the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `to_string` method in the `Unit` class to change the unit string formatting when the 'FITS' format is specified. This is a reasonable approach to the issue described, which is about the representation of the 'Jy/beam' unit in the FITS format. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `to_string` method or the `Unit` class. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the `BlackBody` class in the `physical_models.py` file and the removal of an unused class method `_format_unit_list` in the `generic.py` file. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which does not seem to directly address the 'Jy/beam' unit representation problem. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff, which may or may not be relevant to the actual changes needed. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of unit representation, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
