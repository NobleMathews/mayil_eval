    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to add a `default` parameter to the `DataArray.str.get` method, which aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the function implementation to handle cases where the `index` is out of bounds by returning the `default` value, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to modifying the function to return a default value when the item is not found.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a code snippet that adds the `default` parameter with a default value of `None` and updates the function's logic to return the `default` value if the index is out of bounds. This is in line with the git diff, which also introduces a default value (an empty string) and changes the function's logic to return the default value when necessary.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly in terms of the default value used. The git diff uses an empty string as the default value, while the RESPONSE uses `None`. This difference does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE, as the developer can choose the appropriate default value based on the context.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly updates the docstring to reflect the new parameter and its behavior, which is a necessary step to make the code match the documentation, as mentioned in the issue description.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable and relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, with a minor difference in the choice of the default value.",
