    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed approach to adding LaTeX, MathML, and pretty printers for `HadamardPower`, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the LaTeX printer for `HadamardPower` is implemented using a helper method `_helper_print_standard_power` and a specific LaTeX syntax involving the circled dot operator (`\base^{\base {\base}}`), whereas the RESPONSE suggests using the tensor power syntax (`base^{otimes exp}`). This is a significant deviation from the git diff's approach and does not achieve the same result.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes steps for adding MathML and pretty printers, which are not part of the git diff or the issue description. The issue specifically mentions LaTeX and pretty printers, but not MathML printers. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests extending `HadamardProduct` to support the division symbol, which is not mentioned in the issue or reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It offers a different solution that does not achieve the same result as the git diff, and it includes steps that are not relevant to the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
