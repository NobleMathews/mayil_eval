    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the exception handling in `django/db/migrations/loader.py` to provide a clear warning message when a `NodeNotFoundError` is encountered due to unapplied 'child' migrations of a squashed migration. While this addresses the issue of providing more information to the user when an error occurs, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` to handle the case where a target migration is not in the graph nodes and is in the replacements, by using the last replacement instead. Additionally, the git diff includes a grammar correction in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` and a more informative error message in `django/db/migrations/loader.py` when no migrations are found with a given prefix. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue by addressing error handling, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and misses key elements of the git diff, such as handling partially applied squashed migrations in the migration command files.",
