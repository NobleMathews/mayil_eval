    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an empty `__init__.py` file to the `a` directory, which is not aligned with the git diff and does not address the issue as described. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the Pylint module loading and package recognition logic, which is more aligned with the git diff, but it does not provide specific actionable steps or code changes that match the git diff. The RESPONSE does mention updating the logic in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`, which is not part of the git diff, and it does not provide actionable guidance on how to handle module resolution correctly. The RESPONSE also suggests adding test cases, which is a good practice but is not part of the git diff or the issue's resolution. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it recognizes the need to modify the module loading logic but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
