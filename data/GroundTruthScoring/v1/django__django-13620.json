{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of supporting list arguments inside exclusive required groups in Django management commands.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a custom action by subclassing `argparse.Action` to handle the list of integers for the `--foo` argument. While this is a valid approach to customizing argument parsing in general, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff modifies the `call_command` function to handle list and tuple arguments by iterating over them and converting each element to a string, rather than using a custom action class.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as modifying the `parse_args` list and handling the values for options that are instances of `_AppendConstAction`, `_CountAction`, or `_StoreConstAction`. Instead, it focuses on a different approach that is not supported by the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader issue of supporting list arguments in Django management commands. However, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a solution that would resolve the issue in the same way as the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
