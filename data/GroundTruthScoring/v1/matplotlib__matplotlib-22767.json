    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the line `indices = range(len(self.collections))` to `indices = range(len(self.layers))`, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff correctly changes the line to `indices = range(len(self.collections))` and adds a check to raise a ValueError if the method is used with filled contours, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the file and method to be changed, but it provides incorrect guidance on the specific change to be made, and it does not address the additional improvement of raising an error for filled contours. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
