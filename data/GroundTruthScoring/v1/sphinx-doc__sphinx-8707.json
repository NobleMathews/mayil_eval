    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is partially relevant to the issue and the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to check the `is_supported_builder` function and suggests modifications to it, which aligns with the changes made in the git diff to handle the `singlehtml` and `epub` builders differently. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of the `viewcode_anchor` node or the `ViewcodeAnchorTransform` class, which are significant parts of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration, which is relevant but does not capture the full scope of the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a suggestion to run the `make clean singlehtml html` command again, which is a practical step for testing after making changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and does not address all key aspects of the solution.",
