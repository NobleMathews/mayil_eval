    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'read_body' function to handle 'http.disconnect' messages correctly, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the disconnect outside of the 'read_body' function. The git diff introduces a new 'listen_for_disconnect' coroutine and a 'run_get_response' coroutine, which are used to concurrently listen for a disconnect while getting the response. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the need for these changes and does not address the concurrent handling of the disconnect and the response. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
