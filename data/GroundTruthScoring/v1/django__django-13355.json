{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests optimizing the `Media.__add__` method and proposes using a set for deduplication, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff modifies the `__add__` method to prevent duplicates by checking if items are not already in the list before appending them, which is a more efficient solution for the issue described. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use a set for deduplication could be less efficient due to the conversion of lists to sets and back to lists, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE's mention of a threshold is not aligned with the git diff, which does not implement such a threshold. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution but offers some ideas that are somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is therefore scored a 2.",
