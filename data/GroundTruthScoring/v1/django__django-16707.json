    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `__str__` method of the `DateField` class returns a string representation of the `input_formats` attribute, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. However, the git diff provided does not modify the `DateField` class or its `__str__` method. Instead, the git diff modifies the `django.utils.functional.py` file, specifically the lazy function wrapper, to address the issue with string representation. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem, which involves removing the `__text_cast` method and adjusting the `__cast` method to no longer reference `_delegate_text`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `DateField` class directly is not supported by the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but does not offer actionable content that aligns with the git diff, resulting in a low score.",
