    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear instructions to locate and modify the relevant files to change the term \"Permalink to this headline\" to \"Permalink to this heading\", which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the `sphinx/writers/html5.py` file, which matches the git diff provided. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes further to suggest updating the translation files for different languages, which is a relevant and necessary step not explicitly covered in the git diff but is implied by the context of the issue that mentions the need for a Sphinx 5.0+ change due to translation updates.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes needed in the `sphinx/writers/html.py` file, which is also part of the git diff. This omission means that the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff provided. Furthermore, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes but rather describes the steps to be taken, which is still helpful but not as direct as the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not score higher because it does not mention the `sphinx/writers/html.py` file and does not provide the exact code changes. It does not score lower because it correctly identifies the core issue and provides actionable steps that would lead to a resolution consistent with the git diff's intent.",
