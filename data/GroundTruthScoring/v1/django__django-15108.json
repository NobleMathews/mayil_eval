    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue, suggesting the reuse of logic from `OrderableAggMixin.__init__` in `Window.__init__` and the simplification of `OrderableAggMixin` using `ExpressionList`. It also suggests considering renaming `OrderBy` to `Sort` or `Ordering` and refactoring it to inherit from `ExpressionList`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. The git diff shows a more detailed and specific implementation, including the creation of a new `OrderByList` class and modifications to the `OrderableAggMixin` and `Window` classes to use this new class. The RESPONSE's suggestion to refactor `OrderBy` to inherit from `ExpressionList` and handle the descending syntax is not reflected in the git diff, which instead introduces a new class `OrderByList`. Additionally, the RESPONSE's mention of renaming `OrderBy` to `Sort` or `Ordering` is not supported by the git diff and does not contribute to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the need to handle string expressions in `order_by` and to simplify existing logic, but it lacks the actionable and specific content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
