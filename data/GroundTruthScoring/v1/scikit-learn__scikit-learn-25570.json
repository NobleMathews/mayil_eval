    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is somewhat relevant to the issue described, which is about handling transformers with no features in a `ColumnTransformer`. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_update_fitted_transformers` method to skip transformers with no features, which is a reasonable approach to the problem. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically addresses the issue by filtering out empty feature names in the `_hstack` method rather than modifying the `_update_fitted_transformers` method. The RESPONSE does not mention the `_hstack` method or the need to filter feature names based on non-emptiness, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE offers a different approach that is not supported by the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the issue as described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, so it should receive a score between 1 and 3. Given that the RESPONSE does provide an alternative method to address the issue, albeit not aligned with the git diff, a score of 3 is appropriate.",
