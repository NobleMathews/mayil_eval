    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `bfill` method handles NaN values correctly across chunk boundaries and proposes modifying the implementation to check for NaN values at the chunk boundaries. It also suggests adjusting the chunking strategy if necessary and testing the modified method with different chunk sizes.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue, it lacks specific actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The git diff provides a detailed implementation of a new `push` function in `dask_array_ops.py` and modifies the `bfill` and `ffill` methods in `dataarray.py` and `dataset.py` to handle chunked axes correctly. It also updates the `push` function in `duck_array_ops.py` and modifies the `ffill` and `bfill` functions in `missing.py` to use the new `push` function and change the `dask` parameter from \"parallelized\" to \"allowed\".\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific changes or the introduction of the new `push` function. It also does not provide code snippets or detailed guidance on how to implement the proposed changes. Therefore, it does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
