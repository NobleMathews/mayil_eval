    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `is_upper` method to prevent the IndexError by ensuring the iteration does not go out of bounds for non-square matrices. The proposed code change in the RESPONSE is identical to the change in the git diff for the `is_upper` method, which is the key element to fix the issue. The RESPONSE also includes additional context by pointing to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for the developer to locate the method that needs to be fixed. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it incorrectly refers to the file `common.py` instead of `matrices.py` where the actual change needs to be made, as per the git diff. However, this is a minor discrepancy and does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE.",
