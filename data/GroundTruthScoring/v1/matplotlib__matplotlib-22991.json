    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides an explanation of the error and suggests ensuring that `plt.sca()` is called with an Axes instance, not a SubFigure instance. It also provides alternative code snippets to set the current Axes using an Axes instance obtained from a SubFigure. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the `figure` function in `pyplot.py` to handle `SubFigure` instances and activate their parent `Figure`. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as modifying the `figure` function to accept `SubFigure` as a valid input and updating the documentation to reflect this change. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a solution that would resolve the issue as effectively as the changes in the git diff.",
