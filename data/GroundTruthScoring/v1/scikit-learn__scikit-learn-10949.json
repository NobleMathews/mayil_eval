    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue of the `warn_on_dtype` parameter not functioning as expected when a pandas `DataFrame` is passed to the `check_array` function. It correctly identifies the need to raise a `DataConversionWarning` when a dtype conversion occurs, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a warning mechanism. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a test case to verify the warning, which is a good practice but not directly reflected in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation details such as checking for the presence of multiple dtypes in the DataFrame and storing them, which are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking if `DataConversionWarning` is defined, which is not part of the git diff but is a reasonable step to ensure the warning can be raised. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would help in resolving the issue, but it does not capture all the specific changes made in the git diff.",
