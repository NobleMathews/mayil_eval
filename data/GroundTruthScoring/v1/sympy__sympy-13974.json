    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant solution to the issue of simplifying powers of tensor products. It suggests modifying the `tensor_product_simp_Pow` function to handle cases where all elements in the tensor product are the same and the power is an integer. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff includes more comprehensive changes to the `tensor_product_simp_Mul` function and introduces a new `tensor_product_simp_Pow` function to handle `Pow` expressions with a `TensorProduct` base. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check if all elements are the same and then simplify is not present in the git diff, which instead implements a more general approach to handle powers of tensor products. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the `tensor_product_simp_Mul` function, which are key to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and only partially addresses the issue, warranting a score of 3.",
