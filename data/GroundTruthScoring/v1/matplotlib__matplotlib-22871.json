    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `offset_formats` list in the `ConciseDateFormatter` to ensure that the year is displayed in the offset text. While this could be a potential solution to the problem of the year not being displayed, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the actual fix involves modifying the `format_ticks` function to check for the uniqueness of the year level and to show the offset based on the presence of the value '1' in the unique array for the year level. The RESPONSE does not address this logic and instead suggests a workaround that may not be as robust or directly address the underlying issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to solve the same problem, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a direct or effective solution to the issue described. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
