    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `inv_trig_table` list in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to include \"acsc\" and \"asec\". This change is exactly what is suggested in the git diff, which adds \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to the `inv_trig_table`. However, the RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by also suggesting the addition of hyperbolic inverse trigonometric functions (\"asinh\", \"acosh\", \"atanh\", \"acsch\", \"asech\", \"acoth\"). While these additions are not incorrect and could be seen as an enhancement, they are not part of the git diff nor are they required to resolve the specific issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 instead of a 10, as it introduces changes that are not requested in the issue or reflected in the git diff.",
