    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `_get_dynamic_attr` method to handle decorated methods with more than one argument. It also correctly identifies the need to import `inspect` and to use `inspect.signature` for a more reliable way of handling function signatures. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of using `unwrap` from `inspect` and checking for static methods with `getattr_static`. Instead, it suggests using `inspect.signature` and `unwrap` from `django.utils.functional`, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE also does not include the specific check for static methods and the raising of `ImproperlyConfigured` if the method is not using `@functools.wraps`, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers some valuable advice, it does not fully match the git diff and misses some important details.",
