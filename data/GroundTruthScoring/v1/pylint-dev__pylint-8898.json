    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the '_check_regexp_csv' function in 'pylint/utils/utils.py' to handle regular expressions with commas correctly. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the regular expression pattern to avoid splitting on commas within curly braces, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes as seen in the git diff, but it does offer a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to ensure that the function can differentiate between commas that separate regular expressions and those that are part of a regular expression's syntax.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests testing the updated function with various regular expressions, which is a good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. This additional suggestion does not detract from the relevance of the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the '_check_regexp_csv' function to the '__init__.py' file, which is part of the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE in assisting a developer to fix the issue, as the main problem lies within the handling of the regular expressions.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is highly relevant and closely matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
