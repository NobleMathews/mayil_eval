    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting updates to the `set_headers` method in `django/http/response.py` to handle `.Z` and `.br` file extensions correctly. It correctly identifies the need to add MIME types for these extensions to the dictionary in the `set_headers` method, which aligns with the git diff's addition of MIME types for 'br' and 'compress' (which corresponds to '.Z'). However, the RESPONSE suggests adding 'application/brotli' for 'br' and 'application/x-compress' for 'Z', while the git diff only adds 'application/x-brotli' for 'br' and 'application/x-compress' for 'compress'. The RESPONSE incorrectly assumes that the variable to be used in the dictionary lookup should be the file extension rather than the encoding, which does not align with the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests a change in the logic to use the file extension instead of encoding, which is not supported by the git diff and could potentially introduce a new issue. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the code snippets, which is helpful, but it does not fully align with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
