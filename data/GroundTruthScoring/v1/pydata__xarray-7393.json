    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the implementation of the `stack` method and related classes and methods to ensure that the `dtype` of coordinates is preserved during the stacking process. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff specifically modifies the `__array__` method in the `xarray/core/indexing.py` file to ensure that the `dtype` is preserved when converting to a NumPy array. The RESPONSE does not mention this method or file and instead directs attention to other parts of the codebase that are not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and fails to provide specific, actionable steps that would lead to resolving the issue. Therefore, it scores low on relevance and actionability.",
