    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking for numpy version compatibility issues and investigating various parts of the Astropy codebase for potential incompatibilities with numpy 1.25rc1. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve adding the 'kind=\"stable\"' parameter to the 'argsort' method calls to ensure stable sorting. The RESPONSE does not mention sorting behavior or the 'argsort' method, which are central to the issue described and the solution provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
