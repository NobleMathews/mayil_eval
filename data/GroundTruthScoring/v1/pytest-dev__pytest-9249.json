    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a `sanitize_test_id` function and updating the `pytest_generate_tests` hook to use this function for generating test IDs. It also recommends ensuring that special characters such as `/` and `[]` are replaced or encoded to avoid issues with shell and pytest parsing.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of sanitizing test IDs, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the regular expression used in the `lex` function within the `expression.py` file to include the `/` character. This suggests that the solution to the issue is to allow the `/` character in test IDs rather than sanitizing or replacing it.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention modifying the regular expression or the `lex` function, which is the approach taken in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not closely aligned with the git diff and does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff. However, it does recognize the need to handle special characters in test IDs, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
