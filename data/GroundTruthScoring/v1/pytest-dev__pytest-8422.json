    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature for handling `Decimal` within sequences and mappings, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests checking if elements in a sequence or values in a mapping are instances of `Decimal` and implementing a comparison method for `Decimal` types. This aligns with the git diff, which adds a check for `Decimal` instances and returns an `ApproxDecimal` object. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific implementation details that are present in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `ApproxDecimal` class. Instead, it suggests a generic `compare_decimals` function without showing how it integrates with the existing `approx` function. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes pseudo-code and test cases, which are helpful but do not directly reflect the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it lacks the precision and completeness of the git diff, which is why it scores a 4.",
