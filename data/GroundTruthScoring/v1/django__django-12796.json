{
    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new command-line argument to allow skipping the consistency check and conditionally skipping the call to `loader.check_consistent_history()` based on the new argument. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about allowing `makemigrations` to skip database consistency checks or fail gracefully if the connection is not available.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves catching an `OperationalError` during the consistency check and issuing a warning instead of skipping the check entirely. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a new flag (`--skip-checks`) is a different approach and does not match the git diff's solution of handling the error gracefully.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE lacks actionable content in terms of the actual implementation of the error handling, which is a key part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes suggested in the git diff, which may not provide immediate value to the developer trying to fix the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
