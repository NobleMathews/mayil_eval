    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to addressing the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `get_supported_language_variant` function, which is the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that `LANG_INFO` contains the correct fallbacks and adjusting the order of languages in `settings.LANGUAGES`, which, while not directly addressed in the git diff, are reasonable suggestions for ensuring the correct language selection. The RESPONSE further recommends verifying the `check_for_language` function and testing the changes, which are good practices but not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's approach of using a loop to generate possible language codes, but it does align with the overall goal of fixing the language selection issue. The RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. However, it does not provide the specific code changes needed, which is why it does not score higher.",
