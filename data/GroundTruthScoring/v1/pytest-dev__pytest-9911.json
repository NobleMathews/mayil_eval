    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to update the `raises` function to check for `None` or an empty tuple `()` and raise a `TypeError` with a helpful error message. This aligns with the git diff's intent to raise an error when an invalid `expected_exception` is provided. However, the RESPONSE suggests raising a `TypeError`, while the git diff raises a `ValueError`, which is a significant deviation from the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE extends the solution to the `warns` function and the `xfail` decorator, which is not covered by the git diff but is relevant to the issue description. The RESPONSE also mentions issue #9002 and suggests implementing a check in `warns` to assert that no warnings are emitted if `expected_warning` is not provided, which is not part of the git diff but is related to the issue. The RESPONSE's advice is somewhat relevant but lacks alignment with the git diff in terms of the exception type and does not focus on the specific change made in the git diff. Therefore, the score is adjusted to a 3.",
