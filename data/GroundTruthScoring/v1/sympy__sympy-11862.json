    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting the `mpmath.mp.dps` to maintain the desired precision and modifying the `_print_Float` method in the `MpmathPrinter` class. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes involve more than just setting the precision in the printer. The git diff includes changes to the `Float` class constructor to handle precision correctly, updates to the `lambdify` function to use the correct printer, and removal of an unnecessary `evalf` call in the `nsolve` function. The RESPONSE does not align with these changes and only partially addresses the issue by focusing on the printer's precision handling. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and links to the repository, which are not part of the git diff and do not directly contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
