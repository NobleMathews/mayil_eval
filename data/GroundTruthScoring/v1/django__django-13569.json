    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing or replacing `order_by('?')` with deterministic ordering, which is not aligned with the git diff solution. The git diff adds a `get_group_by_cols` method to the `Random` class in `math.py` to return an empty list, ensuring that the random function call does not break the GROUP BY clause. The RESPONSE does not address this solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests applying random ordering in Python after fetching the results, which is a workaround but does not address the core issue within the Django framework that the git diff aims to fix.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE suggests patching the `get_group_by` method if necessary, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach of modifying the behavior of the GROUP BY clause. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement this patch, and it incorrectly points to `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` instead of the correct file `django/db/models/functions/math.py` where the `Random` class is defined.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is therefore not highly effective in resolving the issue.",
