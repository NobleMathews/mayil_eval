    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue and align with the git diff in several ways:\n\n1. It suggests checking if 'idiff' can handle 'Eq' objects and function symbols like 'f(x)', which is aligned with the git diff that modifies the function to handle instances of 'Function'.\n\n2. It recommends modifying the function to handle different types of 'y', including 'Symbol', a list, or a 'Function', which is consistent with the git diff that adds handling for 'Function' instances.\n\n3. The RESPONSE advises updating the function to handle higher-order derivatives when 'n > 1', which, while not directly addressed in the git diff, is a relevant consideration for the robustness of the 'idiff' function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of a new error message and the specific way 'dydx' is computed for 'Symbol' and 'Function' instances. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'solve' line, which is not part of the git diff provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match but provides a close and relevant approach to solving the issue.",
