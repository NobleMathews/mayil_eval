    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `unique_together` option and ensuring that the `UniqueConstraint` is correctly defined without any conditions, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the Django framework's code to account for `UniqueConstraint` without conditions in the `_check_unique_target` method, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that might be relevant to understanding the issue but does not offer a solution or guidance on how to modify the Django framework code to fix the issue. The RESPONSE fails to address the core of the issue, which is the need to modify the Django framework's validation logic to recognize `UniqueConstraint` without conditions as a valid unique constraint. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
