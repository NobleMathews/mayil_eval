    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive solution to the issue of setting a secure default for the `SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY` in Django. It correctly identifies the need to update the default value in `django/conf/global_settings.py` to 'same-origin', which is in line with the git diff provided. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes further by suggesting updates to the `SecurityMiddleware` class, documentation, tests, and system checks to ensure consistency and thoroughness of the change across the Django framework. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet for updating the `SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY` default value, which matches the git diff. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that the git diff does not include changes to the `SecurityMiddleware`, documentation, tests, or system checks, which means the RESPONSE goes beyond the scope of the git diff. However, these additional steps are relevant and would be necessary for a complete implementation of the feature request, so they add value to the RESPONSE.",
