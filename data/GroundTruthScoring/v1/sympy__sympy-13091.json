    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is to update the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/basic.py` to return `NotImplemented` instead of `False`. This aligns with the git diff, which shows changes in the `__eq__` and `__ne__` methods across various files in the SymPy codebase to return `NotImplemented` instead of `False` when a comparison cannot be made.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update other comparison methods (`__ne__`, `__lt__`, `__le__`, `__gt__`, and `__ge__`) to follow the same principle, which is consistent with the git diff that includes changes to these methods as well.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact changes for each method as shown in the git diff, such as the specific changes to the `__ne__` method to use `return not self == other` instead of `return not self.__eq__(other)`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes needed in other files beyond `sympy/core/basic.py`, which are also part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that is in line with the git diff, but it is not exhaustive in detailing all the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
