    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `__eq__` method does not use `eval` to compare objects, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to avoid evaluation of strings. However, the RESPONSE does not specifically mention the use of `_sympify` as seen in the git diff, which is a key element in the proposed solution. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `__eq__` method to directly compare internal representations, which is not directly related to the git diff but could be considered a general good practice. The advice regarding the `__repr__` method of class `C` and handling non-symbolic objects is not relevant to the git diff, as the issue is with the `sympify` function within SymPy's `__eq__` method, not with the `__repr__` method of other classes. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code but does not directly contribute to solving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but fails to closely match the git diff and does not offer a complete solution to the issue.",
