    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code snippets that align well with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `AdminReadonlyField.contents` method to generate a link for foreign key and m2m fields, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of the `get_admin_url` method and the update to the `contents` method to handle `ForeignObjectRel` and `OneToOneField` relationships. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use `reverse` and `quote` to generate the URL, which is present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE mentions the need to check permissions, which is implied in the issue description but not explicitly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not include the `NoReverseMatch` exception handling present in the git diff, which is a minor omission. Overall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that would help a developer implement a solution similar to the one in the git diff, despite not being an exact match.",
