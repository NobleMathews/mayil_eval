    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that are relevant to the issue of ensuring that `r.history` remains a list and not a tuple. It correctly identifies the need to check the `sessions.py` file around the line mentioned in the issue, which is where the relevant code is located according to the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests maintaining `history` as a list throughout the codebase, which aligns with the change made in the git diff, where `r.history` is assigned the value of `history` as a list instead of converting it to a tuple. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests checking for conditional logic and append operations, which are not part of the diff. However, these suggestions are still relevant to the broader goal of ensuring `history` remains a list. The RESPONSE does not directly reference the exact change made in the git diff, which is why it does not score a 10, but it is still highly relevant and would guide the developer towards a solution similar to the one in the git diff.",
