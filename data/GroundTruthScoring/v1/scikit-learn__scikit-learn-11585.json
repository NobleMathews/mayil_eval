    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `transform` method to apply a scaling factor that is stored during the `fit` method. This approach is different from the git diff, which introduces a `normalize_components` parameter to control the normalization of components and the centering of data. The RESPONSE does not address the introduction of the `normalize_components` parameter or the deprecation warning for the old behavior, which are key elements of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `X.mean(axis=0)` as the scaling factor, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach of normalizing the components based on their norms and centering the data around the mean. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the scaling issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves a similar result in a valid alternative way.",
