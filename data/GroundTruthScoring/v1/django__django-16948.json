    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests importing the RemovedInDjango60Warning, checking if args and kwargs are empty, and issuing a deprecation warning using warnings.warn. The RESPONSE also correctly anticipates the future change to raise a TypeError, which is in line with the issue's description of the desired end state. The RESPONSE's code snippet is almost identical to the git diff, with the only difference being the comment about raising a TypeError in the future, which is a reasonable addition given the context of the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a suggestion to add a test case, which, while not present in the git diff, is a valuable recommendation for maintaining code quality. The RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the exact code comment from the git diff about replacing the warning with a ValueError instead of a TypeError, but this is a minor discrepancy and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
