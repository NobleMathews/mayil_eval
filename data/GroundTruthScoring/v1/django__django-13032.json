    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice for reviewing the `makemigrations.py` file and ensuring database settings are correct, which is relevant to the issue of improving error messages when there is no active database connection. It also suggests catching `OperationalError` exceptions and providing a clear error message, which aligns with the git diff's intent to improve the warning message. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change in the git diff, which is the removal of a period at the end of the warning message. Instead, it suggests a broader set of changes and improvements to error handling that go beyond the scope of the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the broader context of error handling in the `makemigrations.py` file but does not focus on the specific change made in the git diff.",
