    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the django-imagefield library and updating it to be compatible with Django 3.2, which is a reasonable approach given the context of the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide any specific guidance on how to address the issue of the 'model' attribute not pointing to the concrete model in Django 3.2. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the Django source code to add a 'contribute_to_class' method to the field class, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant investigation steps, such as checking the Django 3.2 release notes and migration guide, but it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are somewhat relevant but do not offer direct solutions or insights into fixing the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
