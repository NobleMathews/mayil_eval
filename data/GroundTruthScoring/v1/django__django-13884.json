    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is to ensure that the `next_url` is not incorrectly unquoted or altered in the `set_language` function. This aligns well with the git diff, which removes the `unquote` usage from `set_language` in `django/views/i18n.py`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `next_url` should be validated and safe to redirect to while maintaining its original encoding, which is in line with the git diff's approach to not alter the URL encoding. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the test case to assert the correct URL preservation, which is a good practice and aligns with the git diff that includes a test case. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific lines of code to change, but it offers a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result, which is to preserve the URL encoding when changing the language. Therefore, it scores an 8 as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
