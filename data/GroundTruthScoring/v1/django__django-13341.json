{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the use of `SimpleLazyObject` and provides a solution that involves explicitly converting `self.kwargs` values to strings if they are `SimpleLazyObjects`. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which removes the deprecation warning and the wrapping of URL kwargs with a deprecation warning. Instead, the git diff directly passes `kwargs` to `get_context_data()` without any wrapping or conversion to `SimpleLazyObject`. The RESPONSE does not address the main issue of stopping `TemplateView` from automatically passing `kwargs` into the context, which is what the git diff aims to resolve. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the error message and suggests a workaround, but it does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it offers some relevant advice but does not closely match the git diff or effectively resolve the issue as described.",
