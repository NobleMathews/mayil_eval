    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests refactoring existing conversion functions, integrating them into the `NDUncertainty` class hierarchy, and implementing a robust API for conversion. While these suggestions are somewhat aligned with the issue's goal of adding helpers to convert between different types of uncertainties, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding specific methods for conversion within the uncertainty classes themselves. The git diff shows the implementation of `represent_as`, `_convert_to_variance`, and `_convert_from_variance` methods within the `NDUncertainty` subclasses, which is a more direct and structured approach than what the RESPONSE suggests.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the conversion methods within the class hierarchy, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a large section of irrelevant information regarding code snippets to check, which does not contribute to solving the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the topic of conversion between uncertainty types but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
