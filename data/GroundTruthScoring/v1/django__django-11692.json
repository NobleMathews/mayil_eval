    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests avoiding the use of `union` or `|` with `OuterRef` and proposes an alternative solution using conditional expressions and separate annotations. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the Django ORM's SQL compiler and query resolution to support the use of `OuterRef` in union subqueries. The git diff shows changes to the `get_combinator_sql` method and the `resolve_expression` method to handle subqueries and combined queries correctly. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes needed in the Django ORM to fix the issue, nor does it provide a workaround that would achieve the same result as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
