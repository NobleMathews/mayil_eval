    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of checks and suggestions for troubleshooting the issue with the FilteredRelation and exclude in Django. However, it does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the 'split_exclude' and 'trim_start' methods in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' to handle FilteredRelation annotations correctly when constructing the subquery for the exclude clause.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests inspecting the 'split_exclude' function, which is relevant to the git diff, but it does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make, unlike the git diff which adds '_filtered_relations' to the query and modifies the condition to check for 'first_join.filtered_relation'.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a general list of methods to check, which could be helpful for a developer to understand the context of the issue, but it lacks actionable steps that align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it mentions the 'split_exclude' function, which is part of the git diff, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
