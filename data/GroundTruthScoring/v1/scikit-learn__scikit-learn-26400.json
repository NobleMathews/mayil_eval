    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to add a check in the `_fit` method of the `PowerTransformer` class to handle all-nan columns before applying the transformation. This aligns with the git diff, which adds a check in the `_box_cox_optimize` method to handle all-nan columns. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_fit` method and provides two options for handling the all-nan columns, either by setting a default lambda value or raising a descriptive error message. The git diff specifically raises a `ValueError` if the column is all-nan, which is similar to one of the options provided in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's approach of modifying the `_box_cox_optimize` method and raising the error there, but it does offer a viable alternative approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes additional information about where to find the relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed to match the git diff, which would involve adding the nan check and error raising directly in the `_box_cox_optimize` method.",
