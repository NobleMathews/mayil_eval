    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests converting `pd.Index` to a list before using it in `ColumnTransformer` and ensuring that the `_is_empty_column_selection` function correctly interprets `pd.Index` objects. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of `pd.Index` causing a `ValueError`, it does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff modifies the `_validate_transformers` function to check if the transformer is an instance of `six.string_types` before checking if it is in ('drop', 'passthrough'). The RESPONSE does not mention this change or a similar approach. Instead, it suggests checking and potentially modifying a different function (`_is_empty_column_selection`), which is not mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to the codebase, which could be helpful, but the specific solution it proposes does not align with the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
