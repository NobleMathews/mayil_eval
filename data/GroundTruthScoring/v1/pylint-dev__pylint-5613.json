    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `pylint/__init__.py` file to include a new function `pyreverse` that accepts the desired parameters, which is in line with the issue's request for a better entry point to `pyreverse`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding an `arguments` parameter to the existing `run_pyreverse` function and instead proposes a new function with a different signature. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Run` class in `pylint/pyreverse/main.py` to accept parameters, which is not reflected in the git diff and is not necessary given the git diff's approach of using the `arguments` parameter. The RESPONSE also includes a detailed explanation and code snippets, but these do not align with the git diff's solution and therefore do not provide actionable guidance that would help the developer fix the issue as per the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of providing a better entry point to `pyreverse`, but it does not closely match the git diff and offers an alternative that is not supported by the git diff.",
