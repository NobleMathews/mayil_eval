    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that partially matches the git diff and is somewhat relevant to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `raises` function to handle strings with parentheses in the `match` parameter by using raw strings or escaping special characters, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding a specific message to guide the user when a string is used instead of a regex pattern. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a check to raise a `UserWarning` if the `match` parameter is not a valid regex pattern, which is not present in the git diff and does not directly address the issue described. The RESPONSE includes a code example that attempts to compile the `match` parameter as a regex, which is not aligned with the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippets that do not contribute to resolving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but fails to closely match the git diff and the specific issue described.",
