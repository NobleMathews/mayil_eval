    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue with the incorrect linking of `TracebackType` in the Sphinx documentation. It suggests importing `TracebackType` from the `types` module and ensuring correct annotation, which is aligned with the git diff that adds `from types import TracebackType`. The RESPONSE also recommends updating the Sphinx configuration to resolve the linking issue, which is a valid suggestion but not directly related to the git diff. The advice to use the `:py:class:` role in the docstring for explicit linking is a good practice, although it is not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to check the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration and the `linkcode_resolve` function, which are relevant to the issue but not part of the git diff changes. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the `restify` and `stringify` functions in the git diff, which handle the rendering of the `TracebackType` and other classes with incorrect `__module__` attributes. However, the RESPONSE's suggestions are relevant and could help in resolving the issue, even though they do not cover all aspects of the git diff.",
