    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of increasing the default password salt size in the `BasePasswordHasher` class. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `salt` method and the `salt_entropy` class attribute to achieve the desired entropy level. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to update the `salt` method, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE suggests setting the `salt_entropy` to 131 bits, which is a slight deviation from the git diff's choice of 128 bits, but it still aligns with the issue's requirement for a minimum of 128 bits. The RESPONSE also correctly advises testing the updated hasher and updating documentation and tests, which is good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `must_update_salt` function or the modifications to the `must_update` methods in various hasher classes, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that would likely resolve the issue, it does not fully match the git diff in terms of the complete set of changes made. This warrants a score of 7, as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but is not entirely complete.",
