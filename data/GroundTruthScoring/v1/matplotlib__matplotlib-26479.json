    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the 'papertype' parameter is being passed and if the 'papersize' dictionary includes the 'a4' key with correct dimensions, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a new 'figure' papertype and modifies the logic to handle the 'figure' papertype and the EPS format. The RESPONSE also suggests setting the default 'papertype' in 'rcParams' to 'a4' or explicitly setting it when calling 'savefig', which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to address the changes made in the git diff, such as the deprecation warning adjustments, the handling of the 'figure' papertype, and the modifications to the distillation functions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff.",
