    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue of `Case()` and `ExpressionWrapper()` not working with `DecimalField` on SQLite. It correctly identifies the need to apply `SQLiteNumericMixin` to the `Case` expression, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also suggests verifying the `output_field` of `DecimalField`, checking for incorrect usage of `DecimalField` values, ensuring the correct implementation of `SQLiteNumericMixin`, and considering the use of `CAST` in raw SQL queries. These suggestions are relevant and could potentially help in resolving the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises reviewing the test cases to handle the non-existence of `Foo` objects, which is a valid point but not directly related to the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not mention modifying `ExpressionWrapper`, but it does provide a valid and relevant alternative approach to the issue. Therefore, it scores a 7 for its relevance and potential effectiveness in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
