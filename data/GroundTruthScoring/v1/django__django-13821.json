    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to drop support for SQLite versions less than 3.9.0, including updating the minimum version requirement and removing compatibility code. It also suggests updating documentation and running tests, which are good practices. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically modifies the `check_sqlite_version` function in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py` to raise an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception if the SQLite version is less than 3.9.0. The RESPONSE instead focuses on updating `minimum_database_version` in a different file (`django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py`) and does not mention the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception. While the RESPONSE's approach could be part of a broader solution to the issue, it does not directly address the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in the context of the git diff.",
