    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue. It closely aligns with the git diff by suggesting modifications to the 'to_hdu' method, adding the 'as_image_hdu' parameter, and updating the method to create an 'ImageHDU' when requested. It also proposes a new function for direct conversion and a modified 'write' method for appending to an existing FITS file, which are in line with the issue description.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the addition of the 'as_image_hdu' parameter to the 'to_hdu' method and modifying the method to create an 'ImageHDU' when this parameter is set to True. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the 'write' method to support appending the 'CCDData' as an 'ImageHDU' to an existing FITS file, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it provides a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result. The RESPONSE also includes a suggestion for a new convenience function, which is not present in the git diff but is a valid and helpful addition to address the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE is comprehensive and provides a high-level overview of the steps to implement the feature, along with code snippets that demonstrate the necessary modifications. This level of detail is valuable for a developer looking to resolve the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the modification to the 'fits_ccddata_writer' function as shown in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE's suggestions are still highly relevant and would effectively resolve the issue.",
