    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a Python-based solution to emulate the desired behavior for `__contains` and `__contained_by` lookups for `JSONField` on SQLite. It proposes raising a `NotSupportedError` for SQLite in the `as_sql` method and providing a Python-based fallback method to perform the containment check. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which actually implements support for these lookups by setting `supports_json_field_contains` to `False` for SQLite and Oracle backends and removing the Python-based `JSON_CONTAINS` function from the SQLite backend. The RESPONSE incorrectly suggests setting `supports_json_field_contains` to `True` for SQLite, which is the opposite of what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to raise `NotSupportedError` is already present in the git diff, but the RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the Python-based `JSON_CONTAINS` function, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of JSON containment on SQLite but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach.",
