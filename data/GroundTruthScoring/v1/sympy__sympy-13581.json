    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to simplifying nested Mod expressions, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests implementing a recursive simplification logic in a function called `simplify_mod_expression`, which aligns with the need to handle nested Mod simplifications. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the `doit` function within the sympy library. The git diff shows specific changes to the `doit` function to handle Add and Mul cases with Mod expressions, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use a separate function for simplification is a valid alternative approach, but it lacks the detailed implementation that directly addresses the cases shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the ISSUE.",
