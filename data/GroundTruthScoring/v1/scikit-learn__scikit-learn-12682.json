    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests updating the `SparseCoder` class to accept a `max_iter` parameter and ensures that it is passed to the `Lasso` algorithm when specified. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets that demonstrate how to modify the `SparseCoder.__init__` method and how to use the updated `SparseCoder` in `plot_sparse_coding.py`. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to add a `max_iter` parameter to the `SparseCoder` class and to pass it to the `Lasso` algorithm, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests modifying the `SparseCoder.__init__` method to include `max_iter` and storing it as an instance variable, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of adding `transform_max_iter` to various classes and methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides code snippets that are actionable and demonstrate the necessary changes, which is valuable for the developer. The RESPONSE also correctly advises checking for other potential causes if the warning persists, which is a good practice but not directly related to the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the addition of `transform_max_iter` to the `SparseCoder` class, which is a minor detail present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to add `max_iter` effectively addresses the same issue and achieves the same result as the git diff, so this does not significantly detract from the RESPONSE's value.",
