    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan for upgrading to MathJax 3.0, which is the core issue. It suggests updating the MathJax URL, which aligns with the git diff's change of the 'mathjax_path' to the new MathJax 3.0 URL. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update configuration values and functions to be compatible with MathJax 3.0, which is implied by the issue description but not explicitly shown in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by suggesting changes to 'mathjax_config', 'mathjax2_config', and 'mathjax3_config', as well as the 'install_mathjax' function, which are not part of the git diff. These additional steps are not necessary according to the git diff, but they are not incorrect and could be part of a more comprehensive upgrade process. The RESPONSE also provides a code outline and encourages testing, which is good practice but not part of the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional steps that are not reflected in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
