{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing `request.path_info` with `request.path` in the `catch_all_view` function, which aligns with the git diff's change. However, the RESPONSE also suggests using `request.get_full_path(force_append_slash=True)` for the redirect, which is not present in the git diff and is not necessary for the fix. The git diff shows that simply appending a slash to `request.path` is sufficient. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the exact changes to be made, but it does address the core issue of including the script name when redirecting. The additional suggestion of using `request.get_full_path(force_append_slash=True)` is not aligned with the git diff and introduces an unnecessary complexity, which is why the RESPONSE is scored a 4.",
