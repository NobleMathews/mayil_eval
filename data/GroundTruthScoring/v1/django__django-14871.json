    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on ensuring that the language code is correctly used to construct the path to the Select2 i18n file, which is relevant to the issue of Select2 not loading translations with subtags. It suggests verifying and adjusting the method that returns the language code and the method that constructs the path to the i18n file. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which involves setting the 'lang' attribute in the 'build_attrs' method and using the 'self.i18n_name' variable to construct the i18n file path in the 'media' property. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check the case sensitivity and potentially rename the i18n files does not align with the git diff's approach of using the existing 'SELECT2_TRANSLATIONS' mapping and 'get_language' function. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff's solution. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
