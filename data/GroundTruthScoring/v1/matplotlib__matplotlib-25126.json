    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several suggestions for troubleshooting issues related to axis scaling in Matplotlib, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's solution, which involves adding an `invalidate()` call within the `set()` method of a transform object in `transforms.py`. The RESPONSE suggests verifying the use of `log=True`, calling `ax.relim()` and `ax.autoscale_view()`, ensuring no negative or zero values on a log scale, setting `nonpositive='clip'` for `ax.errorbar`, and redrawing the figure with `fig.canvas.draw()`. These are general troubleshooting steps for axis scaling issues but do not address the specific problem of the plot disappearing after changing the y_scale, nor do they reflect the actual change made in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be relevant for understanding axis scaling, but these do not offer actionable guidance for fixing the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
