    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking for duplicate option additions and refactoring code to prevent conflicts, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by removing the deprecated module 'check_docs' and its references in the codebase, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of the DEPRECATED_MODULES list and the deletion of the 'check_docs.py' file. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests debugging methods that are not relevant to the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
