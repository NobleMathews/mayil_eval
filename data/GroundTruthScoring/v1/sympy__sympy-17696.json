    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue and offers a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the `refine_sign` function to handle cases when `x` is positive and nonzero, which is in line with the git diff's addition of the `refine_sign` function. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a check for a positive constant added to `x`, which is not explicitly covered in the git diff but is a reasonable extension of the logic to handle related cases. The RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is similar to the git diff, with additional checks for `Q.positive(arg) & Q.nonzero(arg)` and for a positive constant added to `x`. These checks are not present in the git diff, but they do not conflict with the git diff's solution and could be considered a valid alternative approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly mention handling imaginary numbers as the git diff does, but since the issue primarily concerns real numbers, this omission does not significantly detract from the RESPONSE's relevance. Overall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that aligns well with the git diff, although it includes additional checks not present in the git diff.",
