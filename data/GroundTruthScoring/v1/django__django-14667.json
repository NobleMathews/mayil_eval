    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a solution to the issue described. Instead, it offers general advice on how to use the `defer()` and `only()` methods, which is not directly relevant to the problem at hand. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific bug in the Django ORM when chaining `defer()` and `only()` methods, which is the core of the issue. The git diff provided shows a change in the `add_deferred_loading` method in Django's query.py file, which is intended to fix the problem. The RESPONSE, however, does not mention or suggest any changes to the codebase, nor does it provide any actionable guidance that would lead to a resolution of the issue. It does, however, correctly identify the relevant code sections that might need to be reviewed, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
