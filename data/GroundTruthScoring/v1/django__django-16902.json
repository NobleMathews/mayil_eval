    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue with the `Right` function in Django's ORM and offers a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the problem in the `get_substr` method and proposes a conditional check to handle the case when the length is zero, which is in line with the git diff's approach of modifying the `get_substr` method to return an empty string for Oracle and SQLite when the length is zero.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests using an `isinstance` check to determine if the length is a `Value` instance with a value of zero, and if so, to return an empty `Value` string. This is a slightly different approach than the git diff, which directly modifies the arguments passed to the `Substr` function without an explicit conditional check. However, the RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative that achieves the same result as the git diff, which is to ensure that an empty string is returned when the length is zero.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises ensuring that the change is reflected in both the `as_oracle` and `as_sqlite` methods if necessary, acknowledging the possibility that the issue might be present in SQLite as well. This is relevant and shows an understanding of the potential scope of the issue across different database backends.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses some points for not providing the exact change as shown in the git diff, but it still offers a viable and effective alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a high score for its relevance and actionable guidance.",
