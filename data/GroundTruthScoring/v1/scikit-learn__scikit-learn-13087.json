    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `calibration_curve` function to support arbitrary bin spacing, which aligns with the issue's request for more flexible binning options. The RESPONSE suggests adding a new parameter `bins` that can be an integer or an array-like structure specifying the bin edges, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of adding a `strategy` parameter with 'uniform' or 'quantile' options.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific implementation. The git diff introduces a `strategy` parameter and implements the logic for 'quantile' and 'uniform' strategies within the function, while the RESPONSE suggests using a `bins` parameter that can directly take an array of bin edges. The RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative, but it does not match the git diff's method of handling binning strategies.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes additional code for input validation and error handling that is not present in the git diff, which is beneficial but not directly related to the issue at hand. Furthermore, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for reference, which is helpful but not a part of the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a partial solution that is relevant and provides some actionable advice, but it does not closely match the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
