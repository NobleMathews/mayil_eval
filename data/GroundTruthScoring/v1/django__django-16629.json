    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `Field` class to accept a Choices class directly and to update the `__init__` method to check if the `choices` argument is an instance of `ChoicesMeta`. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests using the `choices` property of the `ChoicesMeta` instance if the condition is met. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the `_check_choices` method and the documentation, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the exact files and lines to be modified, as shown in the git diff, but it does provide a general outline of the changes needed in the `Field` class, which is sufficient for a developer to implement the solution. The RESPONSE also includes a reminder to add tests and update the documentation, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses a point because it includes an unnecessary step regarding the `_check_choices` method, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff does not show any changes to the `_check_choices` method, indicating that this step may not be necessary for the implementation of the feature. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it includes a minor detail that is not supported by the git diff.",
