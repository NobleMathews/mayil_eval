{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice to modify the attribute preservation logic in the `where` function to ensure that coordinate attributes are not overwritten when `keep_attrs` is set to `True`. This aligns with the git diff's intent to fix the issue of coordinate attributes being overwritten. The RESPONSE suggests preserving the original coordinate attributes from `x`, which is a key aspect of the git diff's solution.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff's approach. The git diff includes additional logic to handle special cases, such as when `x` gets promoted to a `Dataset`, and to fill in global attributes and variable attributes for `DataArray` and `Dataset`. The RESPONSE does not mention these nuances or the import statement for `Dataset`, which is present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to a conditional check `if keep_attrs is True and hasattr(result, \"attrs\")`, which does not exist in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it lacks the complete logic and specific changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it is scored as a 4.",
