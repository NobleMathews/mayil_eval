    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is to catch exceptions when a custom error handler cannot be imported and add a new check code `urls.E008`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the `_check_custom_error_handlers` method and to catch `ImportError` and `ViewDoesNotExist` exceptions. It also correctly suggests adding an error message with the new check code `urls.E008`. The RESPONSE's code snippet is largely in line with the git diff, including the try-except block, the generation of the error message, and the use of `Error` from `django.core.checks`. However, the RESPONSE suggests catching `ModuleNotFoundError` instead of `ImportError`, which is a minor discrepancy as `ModuleNotFoundError` is a subclass of `ImportError` and would still work in this context. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a placeholder for the path (`path.to.view`) and a comment to replace it with the actual path if available, which is not present in the git diff but does not detract from the solution's effectiveness. The RESPONSE does not include the import statement for `ViewDoesNotExist` from `django.core.exceptions`, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE. Overall, the RESPONSE provides a viable solution that aligns closely with the git diff and effectively addresses the issue.",
