    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the `itermonomials` function, which is not generating the correct set of monomials when `min_degrees` is used. It correctly points out that the problem lies in the condition that checks the maximum degree of any single variable instead of the total degree of the monomial. The RESPONSE then provides the exact changes needed to fix the issue, which are to replace the `max(powers.values()) >= min_degree` condition with `sum(powers.values()) >= min_degree`. These changes are in perfect alignment with the git diff provided. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes references to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which would be helpful for a developer looking to understand the context of the changes and verify the solution. The RESPONSE is actionable, precise, and effectively addresses the issue described, matching the git diff's approach.",
