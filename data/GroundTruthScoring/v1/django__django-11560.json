{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `resolve_expression` method to raise a `ValueError` when `ExtractYear` is used on a `DurationField`, which is in line with the git diff that adds a check to raise a `ValueError` for certain lookups on `DurationField`. The RESPONSE also recommends updating the `as_sql` method and ensuring that `DurationField` does not allow invalid comparisons, which are not directly addressed in the git diff but are relevant to the broader issue of handling `DurationField` correctly. The RESPONSE does not specifically mention the exact lookups that should raise an error as the git diff does (i.e., 'year', 'iso_year', 'month', 'week', 'week_day', 'quarter'), which is why it does not score higher. The RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer to locate the necessary code to modify. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific code changes shown in the git diff, which would have made it more aligned with the provided solution.",
