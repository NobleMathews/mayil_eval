    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding error checking logic to raise an error if both singular and plural forms of 'linewidth' and 'edgecolor' are used simultaneously. This is actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff, which also deals with the handling of these parameters. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of updating the kwargs dictionary and then popping the singular forms to be processed later in the function. Instead, it suggests raising an error, which is a different solution to the problem. The RESPONSE is relevant as it addresses the issue of conflicting singular and plural forms, but it does not follow the git diff's method of resolving the issue without raising an error. The RESPONSE also provides links to the code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant sections of the code, but it does not directly align with the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but is not fully aligned with the git diff.",
