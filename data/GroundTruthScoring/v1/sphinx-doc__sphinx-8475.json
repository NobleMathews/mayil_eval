    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `check_uri` function to handle the `TooManyRedirects` exception, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, the RESPONSE introduces unnecessary complexity by suggesting a version check for Sphinx 3.2.0 or higher, which is not present in the git diff and is not required by the issue description. The RESPONSE also adds additional steps such as checking if the final URL matches the expected URL and handling the response accordingly, which are not part of the git diff and are not necessary to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly address the simple addition of the `TooManyRedirects` exception to the existing try-except block, which is the core change in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
