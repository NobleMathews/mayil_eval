    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `Permutation` constructor not enforcing the `size` argument when the permutation is provided in array form. It also correctly suggests that a check should be added to raise an exception when the length of the list is greater than the `size`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff shows that the check should be added in two different places within the constructor, with specific error messages and conditions. The RESPONSE provides a general pseudo code snippet that does not match the git diff's approach of handling different cases separately and does not include the correct error messages. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by suggesting the addition of a check, it does not provide the complete and specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. This warrants a score of 4 as it is partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete.",
