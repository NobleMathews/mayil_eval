    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating deprecated TensorFlow functions in `sympy/utilities/tests/test_lambdify.py` to their recommended replacements, which is relevant to the issue of deprecation warnings. However, the git diff provided shows a comprehensive update to the `sympy/printing/tensorflow.py` and `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` files, which includes changes to the TensorFlow function mappings and other modifications that are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the changes to the function mappings, the introduction of version checks, or the restructuring of the TensorFlow imports and related code. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant by addressing the deprecation warnings, it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks the necessary detail to fully assist a developer in fixing the issue as per the git diff.",
