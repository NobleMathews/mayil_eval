    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to mitigate the BREACH attack by implementing the 'Heal The Breach' technique, which is in line with the git diff's approach. It suggests modifying the `compress_string` function to accept an additional parameter for the number of random bytes and generating a random filename using `secrets.token_hex`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `GZipMiddleware` to pass the `max_random_bytes` to `compress_string`. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff uses a `max_random_bytes` attribute in the `GZipMiddleware` class and a `_get_random_filename` function that uses `secrets.randbelow` instead of `secrets.token_hex`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to `compress_sequence` and the addition of the `max_random_bytes` parameter to it, which are present in the git diff. Despite these differences, the RESPONSE's approach is still a valid alternative to achieve the same goal of mitigating the BREACH attack, and it provides a high-level overview of the necessary changes, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
