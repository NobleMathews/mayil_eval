{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue as a TypeError caused by comparing a NoneType to an int in the add_fields method of a formset in Django. It correctly suggests that the comparison should be updated to check that index is not None before performing the comparison. The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes the exact code change needed, which is to update the conditional check in the add_fields method to include a check for index is not None. This matches the git diff's solution, which adds the same check to the conditional statement. The RESPONSE does not include the exact code snippet from the git diff, but it provides the correct location and the necessary code change, which is why it receives a high score. The RESPONSE could have been more complete by including the addition of the label for the deletion field, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
