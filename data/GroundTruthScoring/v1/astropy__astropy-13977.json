    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__array_ufunc__` method to return `NotImplemented` when an operation cannot be performed due to incompatible units, which is in line with the issue's description. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff shows a more comprehensive solution that includes a try-except block to handle exceptions and return `NotImplemented` under specific conditions, as well as additional checks and conversions for the `out` parameter and handling of the `initial` parameter in reduction methods. The RESPONSE's suggestion to catch `UnitsError` is somewhat relevant but does not match the git diff's broader exception handling, which includes `TypeError` and `ValueError`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes related to output handling and the `initial` parameter that are present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
