    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_generate_removed_altered_foo_together` and `_generate_altered_foo_together` methods in `autodetector.py` to track and combine operations, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff modifies the `can_reduce_through` method in `models.py` to allow for the reduction of operations. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of optimizing `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` operations, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `can_reduce_through` method or any changes to the `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class, which are key elements in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
