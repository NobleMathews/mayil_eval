    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests downgrading Sphinx to version 3.0.4, which does not align with the git diff that provides a code fix for the issue. Investigating changes between versions and checking the specific commit that introduced the regression are not actionable solutions and do not align with the git diff. Adjusting the `OptionManager.group` method's documentation comments is not relevant to the git diff, which modifies the Sphinx codebase itself to handle the issue. Reporting the issue to the Sphinx project is a valid suggestion but does not address the immediate need to fix the code, which the git diff does. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are not relevant to the git diff, which updates the `autodoc/type_comment.py` and `util/inspect.py` files to handle `@contextmanager` decorated methods with type comments. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance that would help in resolving the issue.",
