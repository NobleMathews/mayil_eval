    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `IndexedBase.__new__` method to handle assumptions properly and to avoid passing `**kwargs` to `Expr.__new__`. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the `IndexedBase.__new__` method to handle assumptions and ensures that `Expr.__new__` is not called with `**kwargs`. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `_filter_assumptions` and `_set_assumptions` static methods, which are key parts of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the `Indexed` class in the git diff, such as the addition of the `assumptions0` property and the update to the `__new__` method to set assumptions from the base. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and offers some useful guidance, it is incomplete and does not fully match the git diff's approach to the issue.",
