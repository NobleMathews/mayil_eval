{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is relevant to the git diff and the issue. It should provide guidance that helps the developer to fix the issue, ideally aligning with the git diff or offering a viable alternative.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions, such as ensuring the `Product` model's `parent` field has the necessary lookups and transforms, verifying the `ForeignKey` relationship, overriding the `get_ordering` method, checking for changes in Django's handling of the `ordering` attribute, and as a last resort, removing the `ordering` attribute. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the `_check_ordering` method to include a check for both transforms and lookups when validating the `ordering` attribute. The RESPONSE does not address the specific change in the validation logic that the git diff implements. Instead, it provides general advice that might be relevant to the issue but does not offer a direct solution. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not actionable in the context of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the `ordering` attribute and lookups, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
