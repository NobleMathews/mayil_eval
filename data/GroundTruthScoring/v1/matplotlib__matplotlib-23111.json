{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `_g_sig_digits` function not handling negative `delta` values correctly, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `delta` is positive before passing it to `math.log10`, which is effectively what the git diff does by using `abs(np.spacing(value))` to ensure a positive value for `delta`. The RESPONSE also provides a possible fix with a code snippet that checks if `delta` is non-positive and returns 0 in that case, which is a valid alternative to the git diff's solution. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's approach of using the absolute value function, and it suggests returning 0 or 1 without considering the closest float value as the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section on 'Code snippets to check' which is not directly related to the solution and does not provide actionable guidance for fixing the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not a perfect match, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
