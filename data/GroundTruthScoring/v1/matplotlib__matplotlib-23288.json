    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code snippet that aligns closely with the git diff in addressing the issue of the URL-sensitive area not being rotated in PDF output. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_get_link_annotation' function to correctly calculate 'QuadPoints' for rotated text, which is consistent with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for a fallback behavior for PDF versions that do not support 'QuadPoints', which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE includes additional instructions regarding checking the PDF version for 'QuadPoints' support, which is not present in the git diff. This additional step is not necessary as the git diff assumes that 'QuadPoints' will be used if the angle is not a multiple of 90 degrees, without checking the PDF version.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE's code snippet and explanation closely match the git diff's approach to calculating 'QuadPoints' and the encompassing 'Rect' for the rotated text's clickable area. The RESPONSE correctly suggests adding 'QuadPoints' to the link annotation dictionary and provides a fallback for older PDF versions. The RESPONSE's mention of checking the PDF version for 'QuadPoints' support is not necessary, as the git diff does not include such a check, but it does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, thus it receives a high score.",
