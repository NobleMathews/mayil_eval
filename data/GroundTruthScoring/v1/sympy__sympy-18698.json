    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to debugging the issue with the `sqf_list` function, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. It suggests reviewing the implementation, ensuring the algorithm correctly identifies and groups factors, and checking related helper functions. These steps are actionable and could potentially lead to identifying the problem.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes made to the `_symbolic_factor_list` function, including the addition of the `reduce` and `mul` functions from the `functools` and `operator` modules, respectively, and a change in the logic to handle the case when `method == 'sqf'`. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the addition of these functions, which are key to resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant sections of code. However, these links are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff, and the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make in the code, unlike the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a general direction for debugging but lacks the specific actionable changes provided in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
