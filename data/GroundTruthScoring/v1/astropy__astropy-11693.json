    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'all_world2pix' method call to include the 'quiet=True' parameter to suppress the 'NoConvergence' exception. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which instead introduces a try-except block to handle the 'NoConvergence' exception and uses the 'best_solution' from the exception to provide a fallback result. The RESPONSE fails to address the actual solution implemented in the git diff, which is to provide a warning and a fallback solution rather than simply suppressing the exception. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described.",
