    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to the `pprint` function not formatting subscripts on Greek letters correctly, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the regular expression pattern used to match names with digits in the `sympy/printing/conventions.py` file, which is directly related to how subscripts are determined and formatted. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests verifying and updating the `GSUB` function and `sub` dictionary in `pretty_symbology.py`, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the actual change made in the git diff, which is to modify the regular expression pattern to correctly identify and format subscripts on Greek letters. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that matches the git diff, leading to a score of 2.",
