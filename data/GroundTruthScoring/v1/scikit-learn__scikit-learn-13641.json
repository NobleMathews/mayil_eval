    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with the `CountVectorizer` not handling the `input` argument correctly when a custom `analyzer` is provided. It suggests verifying the use of the custom analyzer, ensuring it reads file content, checking the `build_analyzer` method, and updating the documentation if necessary. These steps are somewhat aligned with the git diff, which adds a new method `_validate_custom_analyzer` to check if the custom analyzer expects file names or file objects and modifies the `build_analyzer` method to handle `input='filename'` or `input='file'` correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific details on how to implement these changes, such as the introduction of the `ChangedBehaviorWarning` or the exact modifications to the `build_analyzer` method. It also does not mention the need to import `ChangedBehaviorWarning` from `..exceptions`, which is a key part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and specificity found in the git diff, thus warranting a score of 4.",
