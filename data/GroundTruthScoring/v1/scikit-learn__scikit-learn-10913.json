    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an `ignore_unseen` parameter to the `MultiLabelBinarizer` class and modifying the `transform` method to handle unseen labels based on this parameter, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the current behavior raises a `KeyError` when encountering unseen labels, which is what the git diff aims to address by adding a warning and ignoring the unseen labels. The RESPONSE does not include the warning message as seen in the git diff, but it does provide a viable alternative solution by suggesting to ignore unseen labels when the parameter is set to `True`. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code implementation for handling unseen labels, but it does give a clear direction on how to modify the `transform` method, which is in line with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE also includes links to the relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer to locate where the changes should be made. The RESPONSE does not mention the import of the `warnings` module, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
