    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the implementation of the `pytest_collection_modifyitems` function and the application of the `skip_marker`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which addresses a specific problem with doctests in properties and wrapped objects by modifying the `_find_lineno` method in the `MockAwareDocTestFinder` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to identify the core problem related to the handling of doctests in properties and wrapped objects, which is the focus of the git diff. Instead, it provides general advice on checking assertions and the correct identification of doctest items, which does not directly address the traceback or the internal error described in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer any insights into the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of handling for wrapped objects using `inspect.unwrap(obj)` or the specific mention of the Python issue (https://bugs.python.org/issue17446) and the related comment about reporting upstream (#8796).\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the context of skipping doctests but lacks the actionable content and specificity needed to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
