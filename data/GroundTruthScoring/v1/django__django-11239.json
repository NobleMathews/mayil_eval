    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to add support for PostgreSQL client certificates and keys to the `dbshell` command in Django, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `DatabaseClient` class in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py` and to update the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method to include the SSL parameters as environment variables. The RESPONSE also correctly states that no changes are required in the `runshell` method since it calls `settings_to_cmd_args_env` to get the command arguments and environment variables.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests modifying a different method (`settings_to_cmd_args_env`) than the one modified in the git diff (`runshell_db`). However, the RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative that achieves the same goal of passing the SSL parameters to the `psql` command. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by mentioning the `runshell` method and the `env` dictionary, which are relevant to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses some points because it does not provide the exact code changes as seen in the git diff, which could have made it easier for the developer to implement the solution. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is still effective and relevant, and it provides a high level of detail that would assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
