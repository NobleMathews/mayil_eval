{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of unquoted fields in SQL queries for the `DatabaseCache` backend, which is required for Snowflake compatibility. The RESPONSE suggests creating or identifying a method to quote identifiers and using it consistently in SQL queries, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using `quote_name` to ensure fields are quoted. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to review the attached patch for the stable/3.2.x branch and consider applying similar changes to the main branch and `django-snowflake`. The hypothetical solution provided in the RESPONSE is a valid approach, although it does not match the git diff's exact changes. The RESPONSE also includes a helpful suggestion to review specific code snippets in the repository, which could assist the developer in locating areas that need changes. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the specific SQL queries that were modified, and it does not mention the changes to the `cache_key_culling_sql` method in the `operations.py` files. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance, it does not fully match the git diff's approach, warranting a score of 7.",
