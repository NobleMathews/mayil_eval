    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests reviewing the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file and modifying the error message in the `except TypeError` block, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to include a check for the common misspelling of `urlpatterns` and to update the error message to suggest checking for typos, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a more descriptive error message. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's wording but offers a similar solution that would help developers identify the issue with the misspelled `urlpatterns`. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the addition of 'the 'urlpatterns' variable' as seen in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. However, it is highly relevant and would assist a developer in fixing the issue.",
