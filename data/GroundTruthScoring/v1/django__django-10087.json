    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `sqlmigrate` command implementation and adding a method to check if the specified app has migrations, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the fix involves importing `apps` from `django.apps` and adding a validation step to check if the app label exists using `apps.get_app_config(app_label)`. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach and instead suggests implementing a new method called `has_migrations`, which is not supported by the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests raising a `CommandError` with a specific message, which is partially aligned with the git diff, but it does not address the validation of the app label itself. The provided code snippets are somewhat relevant but do not offer direct guidance on implementing the fix shown in the git diff.",
