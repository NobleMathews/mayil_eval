    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of comparing a `SkyCoord` instance with a `Frame` instance, which is the core problem described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `BaseCoordinateFrame.__eq__` method to handle the case when the other object is a `SkyCoord` instance, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a type check for `BaseCoordinateFrame` and handling the comparison accordingly.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to extract the frame from the `SkyCoord` and use that for the comparison is a valid approach and effectively resolves the issue. This is similar to the git diff's addition of a check for `BaseCoordinateFrame` and the handling of `SkyCoord` instances in the `sky_coordinate.py` file.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `NotImplemented` return for non-`BaseCoordinateFrame` instances in `baseframe.py` and the detailed handling of `SkyCoord` comparison in `sky_coordinate.py`. While the RESPONSE's solution is effective and relevant, it does not capture all the nuances of the git diff's changes, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that would help a developer fix the issue, and it aligns closely with the git diff's approach, albeit with some differences in implementation details.",
