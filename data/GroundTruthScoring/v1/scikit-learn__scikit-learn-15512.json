    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue of handling non-converged affinity propagation clustering, which is the core of the issue described. It suggests setting the `cluster_center_indices_` and `labels_` to the expected values when the algorithm does not converge, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of the `never_converged` variable and the conditional check for it before setting the cluster labels. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `n_iter_` attribute and proposes adding a `converged_` property, which is a useful feature for users to check the convergence status but is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the `check_array` addition for input validation, which is included in the git diff, hence it does not fully match the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's suggestions are relevant and would effectively resolve the issue, providing a clear and actionable guide for developers. The RESPONSE also includes additional steps such as updating the documentation and ensuring the `convergence_iter` and `max_iter` parameters are used correctly, which are not directly related to the git diff but are valuable for a complete solution.",
