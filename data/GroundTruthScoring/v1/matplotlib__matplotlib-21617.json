    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general investigation into the changes between Matplotlib versions and a review of the `backend_ps.py` file, which is relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the string formatting in the `_get_clip_cmd` and `draw_path_collection` methods, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check for changes related to the `bbox_inches='tight'` parameter and to verify if the issue is related to the `Qt5Agg` backend are not supported by the git diff and do not directly address the issue of missing text in EPS files. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution or workaround that would help in resolving the issue, and it does not align with the git diff's approach to fixing the problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
