    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing double dollar signs from around the \\begin{equation*}...\\end{equation*} environment in the Jupyter notebook, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff indicates that the solution involves changing the LaTeX mode from 'equation*' to 'plain' and wrapping the output in $\\displaystyle ...$ instead of $$...$$. The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead provides incorrect guidance that does not match the git diff or the issue description. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes references to specific lines of code in the repository, which are not part of the git diff and do not provide actionable or relevant information for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any insights or aid developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff and should receive a score of 0.",
