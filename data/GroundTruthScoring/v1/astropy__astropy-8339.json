    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and accurate solution to the issue described, which is the UnboundLocalError due to 'ncp_prior' being referenced before assignment. The RESPONSE correctly suggests adding an 'else' clause to assign 'ncp_prior' to 'self.ncp_prior' when 'self.ncp_prior' is not 'None'. This matches the git diff's approach to the issue, which also includes the addition of the 'else' clause to handle the case when 'self.ncp_prior' is already defined.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which is helpful for the developer to locate the issue and understand the context of the fix. However, the RESPONSE does not include the changes made to the error message in the 'compute_ncp_prior' method, which is part of the git diff. While this omission does not affect the resolution of the UnboundLocalError, it is a deviation from the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9, as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff but does not include all changes from the git diff.",
