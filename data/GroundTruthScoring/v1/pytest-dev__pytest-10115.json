    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general strategy for addressing the issue of removing the dependency on `atomicwrites` from pytest, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests searching the codebase, identifying the specific parts used, considering alternatives or internal implementations, and testing the changes on Windows. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. The git diff shows that the code has been refactored to remove the conditional import of `atomicwrites` and the platform-specific implementation of `_write_pyc` function. Instead, it now uses a single implementation with `os.replace` for atomic file writing, which is a direct and specific solution to the problem. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or any specific code changes, and it includes an irrelevant section with code snippets to check, which are not related to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
