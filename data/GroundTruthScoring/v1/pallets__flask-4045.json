    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to update the `Blueprint` class constructor to raise a `ValueError` if the blueprint name contains a dot, which aligns with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to the file path as `src/flask/sansio/blueprints.py` instead of `src/flask/blueprints.py` as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests that no changes are required in the `add_url_rule` method, which contradicts the git diff that includes changes to this method to raise a `ValueError` for both `endpoint` and `view_func` names containing a dot. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the main issue but fails to recognize the changes needed in the `add_url_rule` method and provides an incorrect file path.",
