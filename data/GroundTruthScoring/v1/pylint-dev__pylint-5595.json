    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. It suggests reviewing and modifying the scoring system implementation to prevent negative scores, which is directly addressed in the git diff by adding a 'max' function to ensure the score does not go below zero. The RESPONSE also recommends adjusting the display of the score to a non-negative range and normalizing it, which is in line with the git diff's intent to make the score more beginner-friendly. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing related functions and implementing a configuration option for toggling the scoring system, which, while not directly mentioned in the git diff, are reasonable and relevant suggestions for a comprehensive solution to the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's code change but offers a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to ensure that the score does not become negative. Therefore, it scores an 8 for its relevance and actionable guidance.",
