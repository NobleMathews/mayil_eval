    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `EmptyFieldListFilter` for `resource_contract` and replacing it with `resource_contract_id`, which is a workaround rather than a fix to the issue. While this advice is somewhat relevant as it avoids the error, it does not address the underlying problem of the `GenericForeignKey` not supporting `empty_strings_allowed`. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `GenericRelation` class to include the `empty_strings_allowed = False` attribute and setting `kwargs['null'] = True` in the `__init__` method. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach to resolving the issue and does not provide a viable alternative solution. It only offers a temporary workaround by suggesting to filter on a different field. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix required, as they do not contribute to resolving the issue described.",
