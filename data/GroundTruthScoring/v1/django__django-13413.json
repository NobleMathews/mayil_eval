    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `BooleanFieldListFilter` class to use the custom `choices` provided in the model field, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE suggests replacing hardcoded `_(\"Yes\")` and `_(\"No\")` strings with labels from `field_choices`, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the correct approach to reference the `True` and `False` keys from `field_choices` to get the custom labels, which is also reflected in the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE introduces additional elements such as `add_facets`, `facet_counts`, and `count_field` which are not present in the git diff. These elements are not necessary to resolve the issue described and could potentially introduce confusion or complexity. Moreover, the RESPONSE suggests registering the modified `BooleanFieldListFilter` using `FieldListFilter.register`, which is not part of the git diff and is not required to fix the issue at hand. The git diff does not include any changes to the registration process of the filter.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for review, which is helpful for context but not directly related to the solution. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that would likely resolve the issue, but it includes additional steps that are not supported by the git diff, hence the score of 8.",
