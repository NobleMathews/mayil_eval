    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative solution to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_route_to_regex' function to strip leading and trailing whitespace from the 'parameter' variable before the identifier check. While this approach could potentially resolve the issue of spaces in path converters, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff adds a check to raise an 'ImproperlyConfigured' exception if the route contains any whitespace, which is a different approach than stripping whitespace. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of whitespace within the parameter name itself, which is what the git diff aims to prevent. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for further review, which is not directly actionable and does not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
