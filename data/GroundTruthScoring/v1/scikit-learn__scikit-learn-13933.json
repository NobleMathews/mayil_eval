{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the changes needed in the code, which aligns well with the git diff. It correctly identifies that the validation set should not influence the bin thresholds used during training, which is a key point in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the binning process should occur after the `train_test_split()` function is called, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises using the `transform` method for the validation data to avoid data leakage, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of using `self._bin_data` method that internally uses `transform` for validation data. The RESPONSE does not include the implementation of the `_bin_data` method and the refactoring of the `fit` method to use this new method, which are present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does provide a valid and effective alternative to the git diff by directly suggesting changes to the `fit` method without the need for an additional helper method. This alternative is still effective and relevant, and thus the RESPONSE should be scored highly.",
