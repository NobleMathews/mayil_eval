    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the calculation of variance and the comparison against the threshold, checking the implementation of a function named `_is_constant_feature`, adjusting a `BOUNDS_THRESHOLD`, and testing with the provided array. It also suggests looking for updates or bug fixes in newer versions of scikit-learn.\n\nHowever, the git diff indicates that the actual solution involves modifying the `fit` method in the `VarianceThreshold` class to handle the case when the threshold is zero by using the peak-to-peak range as an additional measure to identify constant features. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `fit` method or using peak-to-peak range, which is a key part of the solution according to the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does align with the git diff in the sense that it suggests there might be an issue with the calculation of variance or the comparison against the threshold, which is part of the problem. However, it fails to provide the specific actionable steps that are in the git diff, such as importing `min_max_axis` and modifying the variance calculation to include peak-to-peak range when the threshold is zero.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes irrelevant suggestions, such as checking for updates or bug fixes in newer versions of scikit-learn, which do not align with the git diff's approach to solving the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE refers to a non-existent `_is_constant_feature` function and a `BOUNDS_THRESHOLD` which are not part of the solution in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant considerations but lacks the specific, actionable guidance present in the git diff and introduces irrelevant elements, thus it receives a low score.",
