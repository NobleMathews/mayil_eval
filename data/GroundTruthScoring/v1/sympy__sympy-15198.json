    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is relevant to the git diff provided, addressing the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking out a specific commit and reviewing the Octave code generation classes and methods to ensure correct behavior for the `laguerre` and `assoc_laguerre` functions. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of a regression in code printing, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes across multiple files, primarily setting the 'allow_unknown_functions' setting to False in various printers and making adjustments to the testing framework. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or the broader context of the issue, which involves more than just the Octave code generation. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to `sympy/utilities/codegen.py`, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only minimally relevant and does not offer a viable solution or guidance aligned with the git diff.",
