    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating if the issue persists in the latest version of Matplotlib and recommends upgrading if the issue is resolved in a newer version. This is a reasonable initial step but does not directly address the issue described. The RESPONSE also suggests a workaround by manually setting the data limits after the `stackplot` call or swapping the order of plotting commands. While these workarounds might be helpful, they do not align with the git diff, which suggests a code change in the `twinx` and `twiny` methods to preserve the units of the original axes. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `twinx` or `twiny` methods or preserving the units, which is the core of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE proposes investigating the internal changes between Matplotlib versions, which is a generic suggestion and does not provide actionable steps to fix the issue. The code snippets provided are somewhat relevant as they relate to the use of `twinx`, but they do not offer direct guidance on resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
