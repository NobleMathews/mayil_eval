    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides two pieces of actionable advice: correcting the instantiation of `SomeFormSet` with the proper keyword argument for the prefix, and updating the `ValidationError` message to include `form._errors` for better context. The first suggestion is not directly related to the git diff but is a valid correction for the example misuse provided in the issue description. The second suggestion partially aligns with the git diff, as it recommends including more information in the `ValidationError` message, which is the essence of the git diff's change. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `form._errors`, which is different from the git diff's approach of listing the missing fields. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific content to be included in the error message but is still relevant to the issue of making the exception message more informative. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, which could be helpful for context but do not directly contribute to solving the issue.",
