{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of how to use `OuterRef` within a subquery and suggests ensuring that `OuterRef` is used correctly. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the `get_db_prep_value` method, removing the `get_prep_value` method, and adjusting the `get_prep_lookup` and `split_exclude` methods to handle `OuterRef` correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer any actionable changes to the codebase that would resolve the issue. Instead, it provides a general explanation of how to use `OuterRef` with `Exists` and `exclude`, which is not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets for further investigation, but these are not directly related to the actionable changes needed to fix the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
