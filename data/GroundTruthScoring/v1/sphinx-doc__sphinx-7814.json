    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding 'typing.Optional' and 'typing.Union' to the 'intersphinx_mapping' in 'conf.py', ensuring proper import and documentation of the 'Bar' class, using 'autodoc_type_aliases' for aliases or forward references, and possibly upgrading Sphinx. While these suggestions may be helpful in some cases, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the 'sphinx/domains/python.py' file to use '_parse_annotation(typ)' instead of 'type_to_xref(typ)' when adding type annotations to the signature node. The RESPONSE does not address this code change at all, and instead focuses on configuration changes and documentation practices. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of resolving type annotations in Sphinx, but it fails to provide actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
