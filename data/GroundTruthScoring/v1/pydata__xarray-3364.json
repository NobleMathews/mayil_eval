    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `concat` function to accept a new parameter `fill_missing` and to handle missing variables by filling them with `NaN` or another specified fill value. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about concatenating datasets with different variables without requiring dummy variables or dropping mismatched variables. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which simply skips appending variables that are not present in the current dataset, rather than filling them with `NaN`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a new parameter and create new variables filled with `NaN` is a more complex solution than the one provided in the git diff. The git diff's approach is more straightforward and does not involve creating new variables or handling fill values. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer actionable advice that closely matches the git diff. It provides an alternative method, but it is not as effective or relevant as the solution in the git diff.",
