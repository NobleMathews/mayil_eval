    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Patch` class to accept a tuple for the `alpha` parameter and updating the `set_alpha` method accordingly. While this approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `colors.py` file to handle a tuple of a color and an alpha value, which is a different approach than modifying the `Patch` class. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the `colors.py` file, which are key to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
