    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the 'label_tag' method in the 'AdminReadonlyField' class to use 'self.form.label_suffix' instead of a hardcoded colon, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes a step further by suggesting the use of Django's translation framework to ensure that the 'label_suffix' is translatable, which is a relevant and valuable addition to the solution, considering the issue's mention of translation requirements. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the location of the code that needs to be changed and provides a code snippet that would likely resolve the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it suggests adding a new parameter 'label_suffix' to the 'label_tag' method, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the value of the RESPONSE, as it still achieves the same result and is a valid alternative approach.",
