    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that partially matches the git diff and is somewhat relevant to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the __eq__ method in the ValidationError class to allow for comparison of ValidationErrors based on their messages, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE fails to align with the git diff in several ways. The RESPONSE incorrectly instructs to remove the current __eq__ method, which does not exist in the git diff, indicating a misunderstanding of the current codebase. Additionally, the RESPONSE's proposed __eq__ method only compares the sets of messages, which is a simpler approach than the one in the git diff. The git diff includes a more comprehensive comparison that accounts for the message, code, params, error_dict, and error_list attributes, and it also uses the make_hashable utility to handle the ordering of errors. The RESPONSE does not address the need to compare other attributes beyond messages, nor does it suggest handling the ordering of errors. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not provide a complete solution to the issue.",
