    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to generate a proper knot vector for B-splines of degree greater than 1, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It offers actionable advice on the structure of the knot vector and includes pseudo code to generate it. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the conditionals in the Piecewise expressions and the removal of the 'close' parameter from the 'bspline_basis' function. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it discusses the generation of the knot vector, which is a part of the problem, but it does not cover the actual code changes needed to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat helpful but incomplete in the context of the git diff.",
