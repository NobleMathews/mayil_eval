    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on how to handle transactions within a Celery task and suggests adding logging to capture more context when the error occurs. However, it does not address the specific issue of enhancing the TransactionManagementError with the underlying cause of the rollback. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the Django codebase to store the exception that triggers the rollback and then raising it alongside the TransactionManagementError. The RESPONSE fails to suggest any changes to the Django codebase or the handling of exceptions in a way that would capture the original exception causing the rollback. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in the context of transaction management, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the issue of tracking down the cause of the TransactionManagementError. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
