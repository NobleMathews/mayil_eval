    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the 'leg.set_draggable(True)' call before pickling and manually saving the state of the draggable legend or using an alternative serialization method. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by removing the direct attribute access to the canvas in the '__init__' method of a class and replacing it with a property to maintain picklability. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. It suggests workarounds that do not address the underlying problem of the inability to pickle the figure with a draggable legend due to the way the canvas is handled in the code. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to various code snippets that are not directly related to the solution provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as presented.",
