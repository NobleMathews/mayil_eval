    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `DataArray` constructor to accept a scalar value for the `data` argument and to fill the array with that value. The RESPONSE outlines the steps to implement the feature, including updating the `_check_data_shape` function and the `DataArray` constructor, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests adding tests to verify the new functionality, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it achieves the same result and is therefore a valid alternative approach. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating the documentation to reflect the new feature. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not include the change to the `is_scalar` function in `utils.py` as shown in the git diff, which is a minor part of the overall solution.",
