    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the use of the OR operator `|` with `Q` objects and the `union()` method for combining querysets, and updating the `jurisdiction_qs` function accordingly. This is a different approach from the git diff, which modifies the `add` method in the `django/utils/tree.py` file to check if the `connector` is equal to `conn_type` before checking if `data` is in `children`. The RESPONSE does not address the specific change in the git diff, which is a condition within the `add` method of a tree structure that likely affects how querysets are combined internally in Django.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to use `Q` objects and `union()` could be a valid workaround for the issue described, as it changes the way querysets are combined and could potentially avoid the incorrect SQL generation. However, it does not directly address the underlying issue in the Django codebase that the git diff aims to fix. The RESPONSE's alternative approach might work for the user's specific case but does not contribute to resolving the bug in Django itself.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it offers a workaround for the issue but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to fixing the underlying problem in the Django codebase. The score reflects that the RESPONSE is not entirely unhelpful but does not provide a solution that would fix the issue at the source as the git diff does.",
