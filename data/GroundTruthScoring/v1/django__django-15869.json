    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff. It suggests removing the `length_is` filter, which is not what the git diff indicates; instead, the git diff adds a deprecation warning to the `length_is` filter function. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating the documentation and replacing usage in the codebase, which is aligned with the intention of deprecation but is not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to mention the addition of the `RemovedInDjango51Warning` import and the actual deprecation warning code, which are key elements in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the issue as described.",
