    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the feature to display fixture scopes with `pytest --fixtures`, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the `pytest` codebase to include the scope of fixtures when the `--fixtures` option is used and provides a pseudo-code example that outlines the general idea of how to achieve this. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `src/_pytest/python.py` file, including the addition of color-coded output and the inclusion of fixture scope in the output. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the use of color coding, and it does not provide the level of detail shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests looking into the `pytest` plugin system documentation and the `argparse` module, which are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks the specificity and actionable detail present in the git diff.",
