{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance on how to add the required middlewares to the MIDDLEWARE setting in the correct order, which is the main issue described. It correctly advises to add 'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware' before 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware', which aligns with the git diff's addition of a hint suggesting the same order. The RESPONSE also includes the addition of 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware' and 'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware', which, while not directly related to the git diff, are part of the issue description and relevant to ensuring the admin application runs correctly. The RESPONSE does not directly modify the code to include the hint as the git diff does, but it provides the necessary information for a developer to understand the correct order of middlewares. The inclusion of code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the codebase is helpful for locating where changes might be needed, although the git diff specifically targets the addition of a hint in the error message, which the RESPONSE does not address directly. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not fully match the git diff's approach, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
