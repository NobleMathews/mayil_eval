    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows a change in the `empty_form` property of a formset, where the form initialization arguments are refactored into a dictionary called `form_kwargs` and then expanded when creating the `form` instance. This change is meant to prevent a `KeyError` when `empty_permitted` is passed to `form_kwargs`. The RESPONSE, however, suggests setting `empty_permitted` to `True` for the `empty_form` and modifying the formset initialization, which is not related to the actual fix required. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff and does not help the developer in fixing the issue. Therefore, it scores very low on the scale. However, it does mention the `empty_permitted` attribute, which is related to the issue, so it receives a score of 1 instead of 0.",
