    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests sanitizing the `path` variable to remove null bytes and adding logging to identify when the null byte is introduced. It also recommends handling the `ValueError` by catching it and handling it appropriately. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of handling unexpected null bytes in file paths, they do not align with the git diff's approach of adding an exception handler specifically for the `ValueError` and logging the error without altering the path variable. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `iter_modules_and_files` function, which is the focus of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests upgrading the Python version and testing in a newer environment, which is not related to the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it offers some general advice that could be relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
