    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, considering whether it offers a viable alternative to the git diff, and how effectively it addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of the DataArray.quantile method not honoring the `keep_attrs` parameter. It correctly identifies the need to update the `quantile` method in `xarray/core/variable.py` to handle the `keep_attrs` parameter, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that `result.attrs` is set to `self._attrs` when `keep_attrs` is `True`, which is a correct interpretation of the desired behavior and matches the git diff's approach of adding attribute preservation logic to the `quantile` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE further recommends checking if the `keep_attrs` parameter is being correctly passed in all relevant calls within the codebase, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. This additional advice does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE as it could prevent potential bugs related to the issue.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE suggests adding a test case to ensure attributes are preserved when `keep_attrs=True` is specified. While this is a valuable suggestion for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions, it is not part of the git diff. However, this does not significantly reduce the value of the RESPONSE as it still provides a viable solution to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific changes to the `quantile` method signature or the exact implementation details as shown in the git diff, such as the use of `_get_keep_attrs(default=False)` or the conditional assignment of `attrs`. Therefore, it does not fully match the git diff in terms of implementation specifics, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a high score.",
