    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary steps to replace the `precomputed` boolean parameter with a `metric` parameter in the `sklearn.manifold.t_sne.trustworthiness` function, which is in line with the git diff provided. It includes modifying the function signature, updating the documentation, and ensuring that `pairwise_distances` is called with the `metric` parameter. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests adding a deprecation warning for the `precomputed` parameter, which is present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by providing additional guidance on validating the `metric` parameter and updating references to the `trustworthiness` function within the codebase, which, while not explicitly shown in the git diff, are relevant and necessary steps for a complete implementation of the feature.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the addition of the `import warnings` statement, which is present in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes a detailed explanation and code snippets, which are helpful for understanding and implementing the changes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a comprehensive and accurate solution to the issue, closely matching the git diff and offering additional valuable context and guidance.",
