{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `in_bulk()` method to recognize fields with `UniqueConstraint` as unique, which is exactly what the git diff does by adding logic to check for unique fields within the `total_unique_constraints`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `UniqueConstraint` should not be conditional, which is an important consideration that aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation details, such as the specific way of identifying unique fields, but it achieves the same result and is therefore highly relevant. The RESPONSE also provides additional value by suggesting an update to the documentation, which, while not present in the git diff, is a good practice when changing functionality. The links to code snippets are helpful for understanding the context and could assist the developer in locating the relevant sections of code to modify. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation of adding a list of unique fields as the git diff does, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
