    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests enabling probability estimates in the SVC instance by setting `probability=True` to resolve the `NotImplementedError` when calling `.predict_proba(testX)` with `AdaBoostClassifier` using `SVC` as the `base_estimator` and `algorithm=\"SAMME\"`. However, the git diff indicates that the solution to the issue involves modifying the `predict_proba` and `staged_predict_proba` methods in the `weight_boosting.py` file to use a new static method `_compute_proba_from_decision` for computing probabilities. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of refactoring the code to handle probability computation differently. Instead, it suggests a workaround that does not address the underlying issue in the AdaBoost implementation. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
