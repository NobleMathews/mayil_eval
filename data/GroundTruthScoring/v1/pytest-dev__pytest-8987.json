    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests escaping the backslashes in the command line, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the underlying issue is with the regular expression used in the `lex` function of the `_pytest/mark/expression.py` file, which needs to include the backslash character in the `ident` definition. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed in the `expression.py` file and instead provides a workaround that might not resolve the issue in all cases. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the problem with backslashes, but it fails to provide the correct solution, which is to update the code to handle backslashes properly. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
