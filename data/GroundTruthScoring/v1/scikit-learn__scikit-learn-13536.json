    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Pipeline.fit` method to provide a more informative error message when `sample_weight` is passed without the step name prefix, which aligns with the intent of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's proposed solution is to catch the `ValueError` and check if the error message contains \"not enough values to unpack\", which is not present in the git diff. Instead, the git diff adds a check for a different error message and raises a `ValueError` with a specific instruction on how to pass parameters to pipeline steps. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not fully aligned with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for reference, which could be helpful for understanding the context but do not directly contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks complete alignment with the git diff.",
