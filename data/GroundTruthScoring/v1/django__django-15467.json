    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of the 'empty_label' being overridden when 'radio_fields' are set in a ModelAdmin subclass. It suggests modifying the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method to check if 'empty_label' is provided in `kwargs` before setting a default value, which aligns with the git diff's approach of using `kwargs.get('empty_label', _('None'))` to respect a custom 'empty_label' if provided. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to check `db_field.blank` before setting the default 'empty_label'. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's syntax, which uses a more concise and Pythonic way of setting the 'empty_label' with `kwargs.get`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the solution, which could potentially confuse the developer. Despite this, the RESPONSE still offers a viable alternative to the git diff and addresses the issue effectively.",
