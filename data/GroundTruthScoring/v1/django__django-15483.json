    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It discusses the implementation of an `AppAdmin` class, which is not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates modifications to the `_build_app_dict`, `get_app_list`, and `app_index` methods within the `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` file, which are not addressed in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes a general discussion about the `AppAdmin` class and its attributes, which is not reflected in the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the issue at hand. While the RESPONSE does touch on the topic of customizing app listings in the Django admin interface, it fails to provide specific, actionable steps that would help in resolving the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
