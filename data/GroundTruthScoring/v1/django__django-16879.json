    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. It suggests replacing 'sum_total_objs=0' with 'total_things=0' in the 'Case' expression, which is not related to the changes in the git diff. The git diff addresses the issue by modifying the internal handling of aggregates and subqueries in Django's ORM, while the RESPONSE does not address these internal changes at all.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests ensuring 'sum_total_confirmed_objs' is a valid annotation, which is a reasonable suggestion but does not address the core issue described, nor does it align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue but does not offer any specific guidance on what changes to make or how to approach the problem, which makes it minimally actionable. The git diff, on the other hand, provides specific changes to the Django ORM code that would resolve the issue.",
