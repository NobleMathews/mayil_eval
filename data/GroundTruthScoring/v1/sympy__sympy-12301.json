    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to debugging the test failure by suggesting a review of the test function and the construction of the list `C`. However, it does not offer any specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the `cse_main.py` file, which includes modifications to the handling of multiplication and power operations, as well as a simplification of the rebuilding process of expressions. The RESPONSE fails to address these specific changes and instead provides a high-level overview of what might be wrong without any direct reference to the code changes needed. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references Travis CI configuration lines, which are not relevant to the code changes required to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 1.",
