{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new configuration option to disable intersphinx fallbacks and modifying the intersphinx extension to check this configuration option before resolving references. It also includes a high-level overview of the changes needed in the code and provides a pseudo-code example for modifying the `resolve_reference_detect_inventory` function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a comprehensive update to the intersphinx extension, including the addition of a new configuration option `intersphinx_disabled_reftypes`, which is a list of reference types to be disabled. It also includes significant refactoring of the reference resolution functions to support this new feature. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `resolve_reference_detect_inventory` function is somewhat relevant, but it does not capture the complexity or the full scope of the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could potentially lead the developer to focus on unrelated parts of the code.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but lacks the detailed and specific guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
