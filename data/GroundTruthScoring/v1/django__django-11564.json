    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying various classes and methods in different files to handle the `SCRIPT_NAME` prefix for `STATIC_URL` and `MEDIA_URL`. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution implemented was to add a new static method `_add_script_prefix` and two new properties `STATIC_URL` and `MEDIA_URL` to the `LazySettings` class in `django/conf/__init__.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with this approach and instead suggests changes to files and classes not mentioned in the git diff, such as `StaticNode`, `PrefixNode`, `StaticFilesStorage`, and `StaticFilesHandler`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff because it suggests a more complex and widespread change to the codebase, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff indicates a more localized and simpler solution within the `LazySettings` class. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and references to specific lines in the repository, which are not relevant to the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE receives a score of 2 because it does address the issue of adding support for `SCRIPT_NAME` in `STATIC_URL` and `MEDIA_URL`, but the approach it suggests is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE's approach is more complex and involves changes to multiple classes and files, which is not supported by the git diff's solution.",
