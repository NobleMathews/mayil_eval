    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the feature requested in the issue, which is to add an option to the `remove_stale_contenttypes` command to remove entries for nonexistent apps. The RESPONSE suggests adding a new command-line argument and modifying the command's logic, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed argument name (\"--remove-nonexistent-apps\") and the logic to remove content types for apps that no longer exist are conceptually similar to the git diff's addition of the \"--include-stale-apps\" argument and the corresponding logic to handle it. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation details, such as the exact argument name and the specific logic used to filter out the content types to be removed.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets and a step-by-step guide, which are actionable and would assist a developer in implementing the feature. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the import of the `itertools` module or the use of `itertools.groupby`, which are present in the git diff and are key to the implementation.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would enable a developer to implement a feature similar to what is described in the git diff, but it does not match the git diff exactly in terms of the argument name and some implementation details.",
