    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance or a clear solution to the issue described. It suggests reviewing the implementation of type hint processing and potentially modifying the extension's code, but it does not offer specific changes or insights that align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references code snippets from various Sphinx modules that are not directly related to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `parse_reftarget` function and the modifications to the `record_typehints` function. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the interaction between `autodoc_unqualified_typehints` and `autodoc_typehints`, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
