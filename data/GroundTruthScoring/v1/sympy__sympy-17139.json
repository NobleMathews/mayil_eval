    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive review of various parts of the SymPy codebase that could potentially be related to the issue of invalid comparison of complex numbers. It suggests checking the implementation of methods in `power.py` and `numbers.py`, which are relevant to the handling of complex numbers and exponents. It also correctly identifies that the `f(rv)` function in `trigsimp.py` should be checked for invalid comparisons, which aligns with the git diff that adds a check for the reality of the exponent in the `_f` function. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests verifying the behavior of the `simplify` and `trigsimp` functions, which is relevant since the issue occurs during the simplification process. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff but offers a broader set of checks that could help identify and fix the issue, which is why it scores a 7. It does not score higher because it does not pinpoint the exact change made in the git diff, which is adding a condition to return the expression early if the exponent is not real.",
