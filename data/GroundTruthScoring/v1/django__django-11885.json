    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to optimizing the deletion process in Django by combining `DELETE` queries using `OR` conditions. It suggests modifying the `Collector.delete` method and implementing a new method for constructing combined `DELETE` queries, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE lacks specific actionable steps that align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows detailed code changes in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, including the use of `defaultdict`, `partial`, `reduce`, and modifications to the `related_objects` method, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer, but it does not provide the precise guidance needed to implement the changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and detailed alignment with the git diff necessary to score higher.",
