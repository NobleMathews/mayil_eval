    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying and potentially modifying the `PickEvent` class and the `keyPressEvent` and `keyReleaseEvent` methods in `backend_qt.py`. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the general context of event handling in Matplotlib, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by changing the order of connection calls in the `__init__` method of the `Figure` class in `figure.py`, specifically moving the connection of `button_press_event` and `scroll_event` to after the initialization of `_mouse_key_ids`. The RESPONSE does not address this aspect of the issue at all.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Instead, it suggests checking and modifying different parts of the codebase that are not mentioned in the git diff. While the RESPONSE's suggestions could potentially be part of a broader debugging process, they do not offer a direct solution to the issue described and do not reflect the changes made in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE's score is set to 2 because it is somewhat relevant to the context of event handling but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and does not directly help in resolving the specific issue described.",
