{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue and suggests a high-level approach to address it, which includes modifying the `get_group_by()` method and implementing a `_is_hardcoded_value` method. However, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable code changes or specific guidance that aligns with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a concrete change where the `add_extra` method is replaced with `add_annotation` using `Value(1)` to avoid the unnecessary column in the `GROUP BY` clause. The RESPONSE does not mention this change or provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same result. While the RESPONSE does discuss the relevant parts of the code and the nature of the problem, it fails to provide actionable steps or code modifications that would help the developer resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
