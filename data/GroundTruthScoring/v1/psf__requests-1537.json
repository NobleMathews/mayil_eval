{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue of handling non-string/buffer types in the `data` dictionary when encoding multipart/form-data. It suggests modifying the `RequestEncodingMixin._encode_files` method to convert `float` and `datetime` objects to strings, which aligns with the git diff's approach of ensuring non-bytestring values are converted to strings before encoding. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle `datetime` objects using `isoformat()` and `float` objects using `str()`. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, which does not include specific handling for `datetime` objects, nor does it mention the use of `isoformat()`. The RESPONSE also includes additional context by providing code snippets to check, which is helpful but not directly related to the git diff changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that achieves a similar result to the git diff, but with some additional details not present in the diff.",
