    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue of incorrect migration numbering when squashed migrations are present. It suggests reviewing and modifying the logic in `autodetector.py` that generates migration filenames, which is aligned with the git diff's modification of the `parse_number` function in the same file. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle squashed migrations and to test the updated command with squashed migrations present.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific regex solution found in the git diff, which directly addresses the issue by capturing the second number in a squashed migration's name. Instead, it speaks in more general terms about updating functions and logic without specifying the exact change. While the RESPONSE is on the right track and would likely lead to a similar solution, it lacks the precision of the git diff's regex implementation. Therefore, it is scored a 7 for being highly relevant and offering clear guidance that is closely aligned with the git diff but not providing the exact solution.",
