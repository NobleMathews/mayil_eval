    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a more complex solution involving a stack or another mechanism to track each call to `set_level` and the corresponding logging level. While this could be a valid approach to the problem, it is more complex than necessary and does not align with the simplicity of the git diff provided. The git diff shows a simple conditional assignment that only sets `_initial_handler_level` if it is `None`, which is a straightforward fix for the issue. The RESPONSE does align with the git diff in that it suggests replacing 'set' operations with 'setdefault' or similar logic, which is in line with the git diff's approach of only setting the initial level if it has not been set before. However, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest the simple conditional assignment shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any code or specific instructions on how to implement the proposed stack mechanism, which makes it less actionable. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to ensure the original logging level is restored after the test, which is relevant to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff and is not as actionable as it could be.",
