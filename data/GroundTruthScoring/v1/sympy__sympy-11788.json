    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue of the Singularity function powers not printing correctly in the qtconsole. The git diff shows a correction in the LaTeX representation of the Singularity function in the sympy/printing/latex.py file, while the RESPONSE suggests general troubleshooting steps for the Beam class and its load application, which is unrelated to the LaTeX printing issue. The RESPONSE also incorrectly focuses on the Beam class and its methods, which are not part of the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance related to the LaTeX printing problem and instead offers general advice and irrelevant code snippet references. Therefore, it does not help the developer fix the issue at hand.",
