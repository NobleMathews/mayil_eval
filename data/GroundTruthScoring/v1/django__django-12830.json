    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable steps to implement the `absolute_max` parameter in `formset_factory`. It suggests adding the parameter to the function, modifying the `BaseFormSet` class, and updating the `total_form_count` method, which are all relevant to the issue at hand. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `absolute_max` parameter is added with a default value of `None` and includes a conditional check to set its value based on `max_num` and `DEFAULT_MAX_NUM`. It also includes a validation to ensure that `max_num` is not greater than `absolute_max`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, sets a default value of 2000 for `absolute_max` and does not include the conditional logic or validation present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ManagementForm` class, which is not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a potential solution, it does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue.",
