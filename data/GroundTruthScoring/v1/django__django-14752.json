{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests overriding the `get_urls` method in `MyModelAdmin` to use a custom `AutocompleteJsonView` and overriding the `serialize_result` method in `CustomAutocompleteJsonView` to include additional fields in the JSON response, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to maintain the base functionality by calling `super().serialize_result(obj, to_field_name)` and then extending the result, which is in line with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE does not directly include the code changes shown in the git diff, but it provides an alternative approach that achieves the same result, which is to make the `AutocompleteJsonView` more extensible. The RESPONSE does not score a 10 because it does not include the exact changes made in the git diff, such as the comments and the exact structure of the new `serialize_result` method, but it is still highly relevant and provides a viable alternative solution.",
