    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and clear instructions on how to implement transaction handling in the `changelist_view` method of the Django admin, which is exactly what the issue describes and the git diff shows. The RESPONSE correctly suggests wrapping the code block that saves the formset within a `transaction.atomic` block, which is the key change in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes the correct import statement for the transaction module and provides a simplified version of the code snippet with the transaction handling added, which closely matches the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not specify the exact database alias to use in the `transaction.atomic` block, which is indicated in the git diff by `using=router.db_for_write(self.model)`. However, this is a minor detail and the overall RESPONSE is highly valuable and actionable.",
