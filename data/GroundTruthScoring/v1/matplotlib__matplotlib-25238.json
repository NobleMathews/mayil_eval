    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described. It suggests adding a path existence check in the `setup` method of the `FFMpegWriter` class and raising a `FileNotFoundError` if the `outputpath` does not exist. This aligns well with the git diff, which also adds a path validation check using `Path(outfile).parent.resolve(strict=True)` to ensure the output path exists. The RESPONSE's use of `os.path.exists` and `FileNotFoundError` is a slightly different implementation but achieves the same goal as the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the change related to the `__del__` method, where the git diff adds a check for the existence of the `_tmpdir` attribute before cleanup. This omission is why the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10. However, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a clear solution to the main issue, which is the lack of output path validation in the `FFMpegWriter` class.",
