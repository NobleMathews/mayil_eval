    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue described. It suggests reviewing the `makemigrations` command implementation, modifying it to filter models based on the `app_label`, and ensuring that `allow_migrate` is called with the correct parameters. These steps are in line with the git diff, which modifies the loop to use `apps.get_app_config(app_label).get_models()` instead of `apps.get_models(app_label)`, ensuring that only models from the specific app are used for consistency checks.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests testing with multiple database configurations and reviewing the GitHub PR for additional context, which are good practices but not directly reflected in the git diff. However, these suggestions are still valuable for a comprehensive solution to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not provide the specific code change. However, it does guide the developer towards the area of the code that needs to be modified and the nature of the change required, which is to ensure the correct `(app_label, model_name)` pairs are used. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
