    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to identify the lines where the inconsistent alias case issue occurs and to ensure that the alias generation uses a consistent case format. It also recommends updating the relevant method to use a consistent case format and running a test case to verify the fix. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a specific change where the alias is quoted using the `quote_name` method and the format is changed to lowercase 'col%d'. The RESPONSE does not mention using the `quote_name` method, which is a key part of the git diff's approach to the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests replacing string formatting with f-strings for consistency and readability, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a step to update all references to the alias within the file, which is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but does not closely match the git diff's approach.",
