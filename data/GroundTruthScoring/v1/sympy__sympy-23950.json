    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing an `as_relational` method and updating the `as_set` method to raise a more informative error message. While the suggestion to implement `as_relational` is not directly related to the git diff, it could be considered a complementary solution to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not address the primary issue that the `as_set` method should return the set itself, which is what the git diff shows. Instead, it suggests raising a TypeError, which does not align with the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the same methods and classes involved in the issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
