{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `sqlmigrate` command to conditionally set `self.output_transaction` based on `can_rollback_ddl`, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to add a test case to verify the behavior when `can_rollback_ddl` is `False`, which is in line with the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's syntax, as it uses a simple if statement instead of the `and` operator used in the git diff. However, this difference does not affect the correctness or effectiveness of the solution. The RESPONSE also provides additional value by pointing to specific code snippets that are relevant to the issue, which could help the developer understand the context better.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the comment change in the git diff, which is a minor aspect and does not impact the functionality of the fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE receives a score of 8 for its high relevance and clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
