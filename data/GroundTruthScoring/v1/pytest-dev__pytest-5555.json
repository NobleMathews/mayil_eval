    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `pytest_runtest_logreport` function within the stepwise plugin, specifically removing the condition that checks for 'xfail' in `report.keywords`. This indicates that the fix involves modifying the plugin's behavior when handling xfailed tests. The RESPONSE, however, suggests verifying configuration files and the correct use of decorators, which is unrelated to the actual code change needed. It also suggests reporting a potential bug, which does not help in resolving the current issue. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific change in the git diff and does not offer an alternative solution, thus it does not provide value in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
