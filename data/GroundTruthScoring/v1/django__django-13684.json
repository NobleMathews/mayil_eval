{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `load_backend` function to include a more informative error message, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the error message should be conditional based on whether the backend name matches any of the built-in backends, which is reflected in the git diff. The only minor difference is in the exact wording of the error message, but the intent and the actionable advice are the same. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff verbatim, but it achieves the same result with a slightly different implementation, which is why it does not receive a perfect score of 10. However, it is highly relevant and would effectively guide a developer to resolve the issue.",
