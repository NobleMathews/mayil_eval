    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing the partial AUC feature and the McClish correction, which is in line with the ISSUE's request. It suggests modifying the `_binary_roc_auc_score` function to accept a `max_fpr` parameter and apply the McClish correction, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of the `max_fpr` parameter to the `roc_auc_score` function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align perfectly with the git diff. The git diff shows the implementation of the partial AUC and McClish correction directly within the `roc_auc_score` function, while the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_binary_roc_auc_score` function and adding a `mcclish_correction` parameter, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed for the McClish correction, and it incorrectly suggests scaling the partial AUC by `max_fpr`, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section on updating the documentation and adding tests, which is good practice but not part of the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for reference, which could be helpful for the developer but are not directly related to the git diff's changes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that is relevant to the ISSUE but does not closely match the git diff's approach. It provides a partial solution with some inaccuracies and omissions, warranting a score within the 4 to 6 range.",
