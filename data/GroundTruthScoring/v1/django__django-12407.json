    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `IncludeNode` class to use `select_template` instead of `get_template`, which aligns with the issue's description of allowing fallbacks by selecting the most appropriate template. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the render method to handle a tuple of template names and caching the result. Instead, it suggests adding exception handling for `TemplateDoesNotExist`, which is not present in the git diff and does not address the caching mechanism that is a key part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff, such as checking if `self.template.var` is a list and using `select_template` directly without considering the caching strategy. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for review, which, while potentially helpful, do not provide actionable guidance for implementing the fix. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
