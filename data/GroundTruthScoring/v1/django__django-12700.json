    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue of insufficiently cleansing settings in Django, which is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests updating the 'cleanse_setting' method to handle all iterable types, not just 'dict', 'list', and 'tuple', which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding handling for 'list' and 'tuple'. The RESPONSE goes further by suggesting handling for 'set' types and a generic approach for future iterable types, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is a valid and proactive solution. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to avoid cleansing string or bytes objects when checking for generic iterables, which is an important consideration. However, the RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, as it suggests handling 'set' types and a generic iterable check, which are not present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a highly relevant and clear solution that closely aligns with the git diff's approach but includes additional considerations not present in the git diff.",
