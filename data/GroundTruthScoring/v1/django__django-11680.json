    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps for the issue of an unexpected `UPDATE` query being executed instead of an `INSERT` when saving a new `Account` instance with a primary key that has a default. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff shows a code change in the Django framework itself, specifically in the `django/db/models/base.py` file, where a condition is added to force an `INSERT` operation when the primary key has a default and is not provided. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, focuses on reviewing custom `save` methods, verifying field configurations, and using alternative methods like `Account.objects.create()`, which are not related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach of modifying the Django framework code to handle this specific case. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a low score.",
