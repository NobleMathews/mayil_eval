    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `update_or_create` method to use `update_fields` if provided in the `defaults` dictionary. This approach is somewhat aligned with the issue's goal of optimizing database writes by only updating specified fields. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves more comprehensive changes to the Django model's save method and the introduction of a new cached property `_non_pk_concrete_field_names` to optimize the update process.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention the necessary changes to the `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` and the addition of the `_non_pk_concrete_field_names` property, which is a significant part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in `django/db/models/base.py` to utilize the new cached property.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes a lot of unnecessary information about checking unrelated code snippets and files, which does not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests that no changes are required for `get_or_create`, which is not part of the issue or the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a partial solution that is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
