    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code snippets that directly address the issue of replacing deprecated kwargs \"db\" and \"passwd\" with \"database\" and \"password\" in the MySQL backend for Django. The RESPONSE's instructions for updating the `get_connection_params` method in `django/db/backends/mysql/base.py` and the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method in `django/db/backends/mysql/client.py` are in line with the changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the correct context of the issue, mentioning the affected Django versions and the requirement for `mysqlclient` version newer than 1.3.8.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it includes a redundant step of verifying the `mysqlclient` version, which is already established in the issue description as being newer than 1.3.8 for the affected Django versions. This step is unnecessary and does not directly contribute to resolving the issue. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, which remains highly actionable and relevant.",
