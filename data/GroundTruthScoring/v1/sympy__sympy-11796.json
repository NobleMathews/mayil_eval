    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of the concepts of infinity and intervals in SymPy, which is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE. However, it does not offer actionable guidance or a solution to the specific problem described in the ISSUE. The git diff provided shows a code change that addresses a particular case where an interval with identical start and end points at infinity should return an empty set. The RESPONSE fails to mention this specific fix or provide an alternative solution. While the RESPONSE does touch on the broader concepts involved in the ISSUE, it does not align closely with the git diff's approach to resolving the problem. Therefore, it only partially addresses the ISSUE and does not offer a direct solution or alternative approach.",
