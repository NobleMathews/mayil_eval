    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `RenameField` operation does not change the `db_column` attribute and to verify or override methods to prevent database operations if the `db_column` is unchanged. While this is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `alter_field` method in the schema to include a check for whether a field should be altered. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `alter_field` method or adding a `_field_should_be_altered` method, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests creating a custom migration operation, which is not necessary according to the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of preventing unnecessary database operations when the `db_column` is unchanged, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
