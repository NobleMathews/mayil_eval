    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests clipping the `thresholds` array to ensure that no threshold exceeds 1.0, which is a reasonable solution to the problem of thresholds exceeding 1 when `y_score` is a probability estimate. This advice is actionable and relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of setting the arbitrary threshold to `np.inf` to ensure that the curve starts at `(0, 0)`. Instead, it suggests a different solution that does not involve adding an arbitrary threshold. The RESPONSE also includes the addition of a non-regression test, which is in line with the issue's suggestion to add such a test. The test provided in the RESPONSE is similar to the one proposed in the issue, ensuring that no threshold exceeds 1.0. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific change in the git diff, which is to replace `max(y_score) + 1` with `np.inf`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the changes made in the diff. It offers a viable alternative solution but does not match the git diff's approach.",
