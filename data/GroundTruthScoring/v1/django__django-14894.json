    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the Subquery used within Coalesce has a proper `empty_result_set_value` set to `101`, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's renaming of `empty_aggregate_value` to `empty_result_set_value`. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the handling of the EmptyResultSet exception and the use of the Value wrapper in various parts of the code.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests overriding the `empty_result_set_value` of the Subquery class to return `101` instead of `None` or any other default value, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows that the handling of the EmptyResultSet exception has been modified to check for `empty_result_set_value` and use it if it is not NotImplemented.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides a hypothetical code snippet that might be used to address the issue, which includes a conditional check for an empty `list_x` and setting a default value. This approach is not present in the git diff, and while it could be a valid workaround, it does not reflect the changes made in the git diff to address the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the concept of `empty_result_set_value`, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a solution that aligns with the changes made in the git diff.",
