    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the addition of a new parameter to handle file modes and updating the method accordingly. It also correctly identifies the need to update the documentation and tests. However, the RESPONSE introduces a new parameter 'mode' with a default value of 't' for text mode, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff adds a 'text' parameter with a default value of 'True' and modifies the file opening line to use 'r' for text and 'rb' for binary mode based on the 'text' parameter. The RESPONSE's suggestion to deprecate the 'text' parameter in favor of 'mode' is not supported by the git diff and introduces unnecessary complexity. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of maintaining backward compatibility by adding a 'text' parameter instead of a 'mode' parameter. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the issue as described.",
