    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution to the issue of raising descriptive errors for unsupported operations following QuerySet.union(), intersection(), and difference(). It suggests adding a method `_not_support_combined_queries` within the `QuerySet` class, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that this method should raise a `NotSupportedError` when an unsupported operation is attempted on a combined QuerySet, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the `_not_support_combined_queries` method and its usage in various QuerySet methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE further advises calling `_not_support_combined_queries` at the beginning of methods that are not supported after a combination, such as `distinct`, `extra`, `defer`, and `reverse`. This is in line with the git diff, which adds calls to `_not_support_combined_queries` in several QuerySet methods.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE correctly states that the `count` method should not call `_not_support_combined_queries`, which is consistent with the git diff not modifying the `count` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests updating the documentation and adding relevant error messages, which, while not shown in the git diff, are reasonable and necessary steps for the complete resolution of the issue.\n\nThe only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the RESPONSE includes the suggestion to update the `QuerySet` class to track if it is a result of a combination using an attribute like `self._result_of_combination`. This specific implementation detail is not present in the git diff, and the git diff's approach does not require adding such an attribute. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE, as the core solution aligns well with the git diff.",
