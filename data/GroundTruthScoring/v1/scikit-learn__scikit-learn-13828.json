    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the affinity_matrix is sparse and converting it to a dense array before calculating the median, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `fit` method to conditionally accept sparse matrices based on the `affinity` parameter. The RESPONSE does not address this specific change but instead offers a workaround for handling sparse matrices that is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding tests for both dense and sparse precomputed affinity matrices, which is a good practice but is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of handling sparse matrices but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach.",
