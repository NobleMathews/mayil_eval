    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a step-by-step guide to implement the feature request, which includes adding a new configuration variable and modifying the `CoverageBuilder` class methods to print missing coverage as a warning. The RESPONSE suggests adding a configuration variable named `coverage_print_missing_as_warning`, which is similar to the git diff's `coverage_show_missing_items`. However, the RESPONSE does not include the detailed implementation of logging warnings or information messages with the `red` function from `sphinx.util.console`, which is a significant part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the `write_py_coverage` method in the git diff, which includes detailed logging for undocumented Python functions, classes, and methods. The RESPONSE's guidance is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and detail in comparison to the git diff's approach.",
