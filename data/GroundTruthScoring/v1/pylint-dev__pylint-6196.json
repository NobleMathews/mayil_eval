    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance or a clear solution to the issue described. It only reiterates some of the questions posed in the issue without providing answers or a clear direction. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the new decorator `only_required_for_messages`, the deprecation of `check_messages`, or the addition of type variables and imports that are relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. The RESPONSE does not help the developer understand the changes needed to fix the issue, nor does it provide any insights into how to correctly use or improve the `@check_messages` decorator. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant due to mentioning the decorator and its purpose but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
