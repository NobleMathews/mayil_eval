    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs` in SymPy. It suggests modifying the `sign` function's `rewrite` method to handle the case when the argument is zero, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a new `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method that includes a `Piecewise` expression to handle the zero case.\n\nThe RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to handle division by zero, which is a key part of the issue description. However, it suggests returning `S.NaN` or `S.Zero` based on the desired behavior, which is not exactly what the git diff does. The git diff uses a `Piecewise` function to return 0 when the argument is zero and otherwise returns `arg / Abs(arg)`. The RESPONSE does not mention the use of `Piecewise`, which is a minor deviation from the git diff but still achieves the goal of handling the zero case.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional context and links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer. However, it includes a suggestion to check if `arg.is_zero`, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff assumes that the argument can be zero and handles it with `Piecewise` without an explicit check.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not match it exactly due to the absence of `Piecewise` and the suggestion to use `arg.is_zero`. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
