    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general strategy for addressing the issue with `.swap_dims()` modifying the original object, which is relevant to the issue described. It suggests ensuring that `swap_dims` returns a new `Dataset` object without modifying the original, which is aligned with the intent of the git diff to prevent unintended modifications. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to check for in-place operations and shared references to mutable objects, which is a plausible cause of the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or mention the need to add type hints and return types, which are key elements in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding tests, which is good practice but not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks the specificity and completeness of the changes shown in the git diff, warranting a score within the 4-6 range.",
