    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Interval` for `test_size` in the `@validate_params` decorator to disallow negative values and to use `closed='right'` for `numbers.Integral` to exclude negative integers. However, the git diff provided does not involve changes to a decorator or the use of `Interval` objects. Instead, the git diff modifies the conditional checks within the `_validate_shuffle_split_init` and `_validate_shuffle_split` functions to include conditions that prevent negative values for `test_size` and `train_size`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to disallow negative values, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's method of resolving the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
