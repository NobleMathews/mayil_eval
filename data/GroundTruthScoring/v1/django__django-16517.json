    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps for the developer to check and potentially fix the issue with mixed-case views/templates names causing 404 errors. It suggests verifying the docstring, ensuring the URL pattern captures the view path with case sensitivity, and inspecting the `_get_view_func` method. These are relevant to the issue described.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows a change in the `create_reference_role` function within `django/contrib/admindocs/utils.py`, where it introduces a condition to check if the role name is 'template' or 'view' and then refrains from converting the text to lowercase if it is case-sensitive. This is the actual fix for the issue, which the RESPONSE does not mention.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but these are not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat helpful in guiding the developer to investigate the issue but does not provide the specific solution required, as shown in the git diff.",
