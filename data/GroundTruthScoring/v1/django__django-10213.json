    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing the `--force-colors` flag in Django management commands, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests creating a new function `force_color_support` and modifying the `OutputWrapper` class, which are not part of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the necessary changes to the `BaseCommand` class constructor, the `create_parser` method, or the `execute` method, which are key elements of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes incorrect references to `--force-colors` instead of `--force-color` and provides a link to code snippets that are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
