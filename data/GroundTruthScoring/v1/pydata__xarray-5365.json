    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the vector cross product feature in xarray, which is the issue at hand. It outlines the steps to define the `cross` function, ensure compatibility with Dask, add input validation, and use `xarray.apply_ufunc` to apply `numpy.cross`. The RESPONSE also suggests handling cases where input arrays have different sizes, setting the `output_dtype`, adding unit tests, updating documentation, and considering the addition of a `DataArray.cross` method. Additionally, it provides a simplified version of the `cross` function and an example of how to use it, which aligns well with the git diff's implementation of the `cross` function.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the detailed implementation with all the checks and handling of different vector sizes. However, it does cover the main aspects of the feature request and provides actionable guidance that would help a developer implement the feature. The RESPONSE also includes a simplified version of the `cross` function, which captures the essence of the git diff's implementation but lacks the full detail and complexity.\n\nThe RESPONSE could have scored higher if it included the full implementation details as seen in the git diff, such as handling vectors of size 1 and 2, aligning inputs, and padding with zeros. However, it still provides a strong foundation for implementing the feature and is highly relevant to the issue.",
