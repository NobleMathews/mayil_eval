    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests updating the `_check_filter_horizontal` and `_check_filter_vertical` methods to include a check for `ManyToManyField` with a `through` parameter, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a check in the `_check_filter_item` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to raise an error if a `ManyToManyField` specifies a `through` model, which matches the git diff's introduction of an error condition for non-auto-created `through` models. The error message provided in the RESPONSE is informative and relevant, advising the user about the incompatibility of `filter_horizontal` and `filter_vertical` with custom `through` models. The RESPONSE loses some points because it does not directly modify the `_check_filter_item` method as the git diff does, but instead suggests changes to `_check_filter_horizontal` and potentially `_check_filter_vertical`. However, the RESPONSE's approach is still valid and would achieve the desired outcome of adding the necessary system check. The RESPONSE also correctly advises ensuring that the error ID is unique, which is a detail that aligns with best practices in Django's system checks framework.",
