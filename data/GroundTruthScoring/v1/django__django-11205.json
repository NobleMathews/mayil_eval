    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but lacks alignment with the git diff or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'get_count' method in 'django/db/models/sql/query.py' to optimize the SQL query generation process by checking for filters before including a join. While the RESPONSE's intent to optimize the SQL query aligns with the ISSUE's goal of improving the efficiency of the count() method on a ManyToMany relation, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the actual changes were made in 'django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py' by removing the 'constrained_target' property and the overridden 'exists' and 'count' methods. The RESPONSE does not mention or address these specific changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces a new method 'has_filters' which is not present in the git diff, and it assumes the existence of this method without providing its implementation. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the performance issue but fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
