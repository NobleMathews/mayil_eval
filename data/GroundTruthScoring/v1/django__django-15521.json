    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'is_valid_locale' function to support custom locale formats like 'nl-nl-x-informal' and updating the regular expression to match the custom locale format. This is actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the 'is_valid_locale' function and the regular expression within it. However, the RESPONSE's proposed regex pattern does not match the git diff's approach to handling the locale validation. The git diff introduces a more complex regex pattern that accounts for different parts of the locale string and suggests a possible valid locale if the input is invalid. The RESPONSE's regex is simpler and does not provide the same level of detail or functionality. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the additional logic for suggesting a corrected locale, which is a significant part of the git diff's solution to the issue. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by focusing on the 'is_valid_locale' function and regex, it does not fully capture the complexity or the complete solution provided in the git diff.",
