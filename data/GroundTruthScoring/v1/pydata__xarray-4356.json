    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'sum' function in 'xarray/core/_aggregations.py' to handle the 'min_count' parameter correctly when multiple dimensions are specified. However, the git diff indicates that the necessary changes are in 'xarray/core/nanops.py', not '_aggregations.py'. The RESPONSE does not address the correct file or the specific change needed, which is to replace 'mask.shape[axis]' with 'np.take(mask.shape, axis).prod()' in the '_maybe_null_out' function. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the need to handle 'min_count' with multiple dimensions, but it fails to provide actionable content or closely match the git diff, which is why it receives a score of 1.",
