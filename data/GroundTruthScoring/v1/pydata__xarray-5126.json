    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new option to control the collapsed state of the HTML representation and updating the HTML formatter and CSS accordingly. While this approach is somewhat relevant to the issue of providing an option for collapsing the HTML display, it does not align with the git diff's implementation of adding specific options for different sections of the display (e.g., attributes, coordinates, data variables, and data) and using a helper function to determine the boolean value with a default. The RESPONSE fails to mention the addition of the `_get_boolean_with_default` function and the specific options for each section, which are key elements in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue, such as modifying the `_mapping_repr` and `_mapping_section` functions to use the new options. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
