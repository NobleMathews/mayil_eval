    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on checking the dimensions of quantities and ensuring dimensional consistency in expressions, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of dimension checking in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. However, it does not address the specific problem described in the issue, which is the incorrect detection of equivalent dimensions during addition. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the comparison logic in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to use `self.get_dimension_system().equivalent_dims` instead of a direct equality check. The RESPONSE fails to mention or suggest any changes to the comparison logic or the use of `equivalent_dims` method, which is the key to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. It does not help the developer to fix the issue as described, warranting a low score.",
