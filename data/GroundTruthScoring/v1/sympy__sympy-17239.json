    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to fixing the issue with relational printing in various language printers within the SymPy library. It suggests updating the `_print_Relational` method for each printer to ensure that relational expressions are printed correctly according to the syntax of the target language. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes made to the `_print_Relational` method in multiple files, including the removal of parentheses in the return statement and the addition of the `_print_Relational` method to the `codeprinter.py` file as a not supported function. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests creating or updating the `_print_Relational` method with a dictionary mapping for operators, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes incorrect information about the syntax for some languages (e.g., Mathematica does not use '===' for equality) and suggests creating new files that do not exist in the git diff (e.g., `mathematicacode.py`, `rustcode.py`). The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of relational printing, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and contains inaccuracies.",
