    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `Session` class's `request` method to ensure that cookies provided in the `kwargs` of a request are not saved to the session's cookie jar. This aligns with the intent of the git diff to prevent request cookies from being persisted to the session. However, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff as it does not mention the changes made to `auth.py` and `models.py`, which are also part of the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `extract_cookies_to_jar` only with the response object, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of using `extract_cookies_to_jar` to handle cookies correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not address the addition of the `_cookies` attribute in `models.py` or the modification of the `prepare_cookies` method to use `self._cookies` instead of the passed `cookies` parameter. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks the complete changes needed as per the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers a partial solution, but it is incomplete and does not match the git diff in full detail.",
