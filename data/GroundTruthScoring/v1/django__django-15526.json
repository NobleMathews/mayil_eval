    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the location of the issue within the `get_view_on_site_url` method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` and provides the exact solution to add the `current_app` argument to the `reverse` call, setting its value to `self.admin_site.name`. This matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet demonstrating the change, which is helpful for the developer. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not include the exact line numbers or the full context of the change as shown in the git diff, but this is a minor detail and does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE.",
