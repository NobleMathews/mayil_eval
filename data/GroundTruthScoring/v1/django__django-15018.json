    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the 'dest=until' from the '--for' argument and updating the 'handle' method to accept a new 'duration' parameter, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff adds a check to raise a TypeError if multiple arguments with the same 'dest' are passed via **options, which is not addressed in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, it does recognize the problem of handling mutually exclusive arguments with the same 'dest', which is somewhat relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE fails to offer a solution that would prevent the TypeError from being raised, which is the core of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, but these do not directly contribute to resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
