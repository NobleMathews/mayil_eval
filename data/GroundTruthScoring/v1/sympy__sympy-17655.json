    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `__add__` method to handle the case where a `Mul` object is added to a `Point` object and modifying the `__mul__` method to ensure it can handle multiplication with a `sympy` expression correctly. However, the git diff provided a simpler and more direct solution by implementing the `__rmul__` method, which is the Pythonic way to handle right-side multiplication. The RESPONSE's approach of modifying the `__add__` method is not aligned with the git diff and is more complex than necessary. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `__mul__` method is not relevant to the issue, as the problem is with right-side multiplication, not the existing `__mul__` method. The RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and introduces unnecessary complexity, which is why it receives a low score.",
