    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to implement the feature where `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline class defaults to the pluralized form of `verbose_name` if it is specified. It suggests modifying the `__init__` method of the `InlineModelAdmin` class and using Django's `pluralize` function to achieve the pluralization. This aligns with the git diff's intention to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` when the latter is specified.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the exact implementation. The git diff uses `format_lazy('{}s', self.verbose_name)` to create the plural form, while the RESPONSE suggests using the `pluralize` function from `django.utils.text`. The RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative, but it is not the same as the git diff's approach.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE does not include the conditional check for `self.verbose_name` being `None` before setting `self.verbose_name_plural` to `self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural`, which is present in the git diff. This omission makes the RESPONSE incomplete in terms of fully addressing the issue as described and as fixed in the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 4 as it offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and does not fully align with the git diff's approach.",
