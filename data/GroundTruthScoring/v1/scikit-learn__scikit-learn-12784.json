    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some relevant information regarding the use of 'seuclidean' and 'mahalanobis' distance metrics with KNeighborsRegressor, and the need for appropriate metric_params. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the issue of different results for different n_jobs values, nor does it provide actionable guidance on how to resolve the TypeError with utils.validation.check_array when a pandas series is passed in. The RESPONSE also suggests upgrading to a newer version of scikit-learn without specific evidence that the issue is resolved in later versions.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need for setting 'V' and 'VI' parameters when using 'seuclidean' and 'mahalanobis' metrics, respectively. However, it fails to provide a clear solution to the issue of inconsistent predictions with different n_jobs values. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the TypeError issue with check_array and pandas series, which is a significant part of the original issue. The suggestion to upgrade scikit-learn is not backed by evidence that the issue is fixed in newer versions.",
