{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests specifying the `output_field` for the `Value` expression manually to resolve the `FieldError`. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves modifying the Django source code to automatically resolve the `output_field` for standard library types. The git diff shows changes in multiple files, including `expressions.py`, `functions.py`, and `ranges.py`, to implement automatic resolution of the `output_field`. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or the broader context of modifying Django's behavior. Instead, it provides a workaround that would be applied at the call site in user code. The RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it offers a temporary solution to the symptom of the problem but does not guide the developer in implementing the necessary changes to the Django source code as shown in the git diff.",
