    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code snippets that closely align with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler.get_response_async` method to handle `FileResponse` with an asynchronous iterator. The RESPONSE suggests using `sync_to_async` to convert the synchronous iterator into an asynchronous one, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `awrapper` function should be an asynchronous generator. The only minor discrepancy is the suggestion to apply `sync_to_async` to each part of the iterator individually, which differs from the git diff's approach of converting the entire iterator to a list first. However, this alternative approach is still valid and could be more efficient for large files, so it does not warrant a significant deduction in score. The RESPONSE also provides helpful links to the relevant code snippets for further reference. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
