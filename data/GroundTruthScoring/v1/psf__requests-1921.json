    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests identifying and modifying the code responsible for setting headers in a `requests.Session` object and ensuring that setting a header to `None` results in the header being deleted. It also suggests modifying the `prepare_headers` method in `requests.models.PreparedRequest` to skip headers with `None` values. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of handling `None` values for headers, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `merge_setting` function within `requests/sessions.py`, where a dictionary comprehension is used to create a new dictionary that excludes any items with `None` values. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying the `__setitem__` method in the `CaseInsensitiveDict` class and the `prepare_headers` method, which are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the problem of handling `None` values for headers, but it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
