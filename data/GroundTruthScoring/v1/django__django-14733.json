    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive solution to the issue of allowing the overriding of the deletion widget in formsets in Django. It suggests adding a new property and method to the BaseFormSet class, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of the deletion_widget and get_deletion_widget() method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the add_fields method to use the new get_deletion_widget() method, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to the DELETION_FIELD_NAME field.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by suggesting updates to the BaseInlineFormSet and InlineModelAdmin classes, as well as the template rendering logic. While these suggestions are not part of the git diff, they are relevant and would be necessary for a complete implementation of the feature in a real-world scenario. The RESPONSE also encourages writing tests to ensure the feature works correctly, which is a best practice not explicitly mentioned in the git diff but is important for maintaining software quality.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes. However, it provides a valid, effective alternative approach to achieving the same result as the git diff, which is to allow the overriding of the deletion widget in formsets. The RESPONSE's additional suggestions for updating related classes and templates are valuable and would likely be required for full integration of the feature into the Django framework.",
