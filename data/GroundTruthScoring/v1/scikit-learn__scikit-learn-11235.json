    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps that are relevant to the issue described. It suggests not deleting 'self.n_samples_seen_' in the '_reset' method, which aligns with the git diff's addition of conditions to handle 'self.n_samples_seen_' without deletion. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to set 'self.mean_' and 'self.var_' to 'None' when 'with_mean=False' and 'with_std=False', which is consistent with the git diff's changes to handle these cases. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to update 'self.n_samples_seen_' in the 'partial_fit' method is in line with the git diff's modifications to that method.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to add a check in the 'fit' method to raise a 'ValueError' if both 'with_mean' and 'with_std' are set to 'False', which is not present in the git diff. This suggestion, while potentially valuable, does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. Furthermore, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff to the 'partial_fit' method, such as the conditions added for incrementing 'self.n_samples_seen_'.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff and offers some actionable advice, but it is incomplete and includes suggestions not supported by the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides some value but is not fully aligned with the git diff.",
