{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_format` function to accept a `lazy` parameter and evaluate lazy strings before using them, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a line to ensure `format_type` is a string. This change would indeed prevent the TypeError described in the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE recommends updating the `date` template filter to evaluate lazy strings before passing them to `get_format`, which is a proactive step to ensure that the issue is resolved at the source. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change needed, which is provided in the git diff. The git diff shows a specific line added to convert `format_type` to a string, which is a direct and minimal change to address the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `date` template filter is not reflected in the git diff, but it is a relevant and potentially useful recommendation to prevent similar issues in other parts of the code. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not match it exactly, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
