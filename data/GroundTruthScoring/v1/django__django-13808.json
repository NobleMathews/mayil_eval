    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff by suggesting modifications to the `DatabaseWrapper` class in `django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py` to handle a new `SERVICE` option. This aligns with the git diff's approach of modifying the connection parameters to support PostgreSQL services. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific changes proposed. The git diff includes conditional logic to handle cases where the `NAME` is empty and the `OPTIONS` dictionary contains a `service` key, whereas the RESPONSE suggests adding a `SERVICE` key directly to the `settings_dict`. The RESPONSE also does not address the changes needed in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`, which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the core issue of supporting PostgreSQL services in Django but does not provide a complete or accurate guide to the changes needed as per the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 for offering some actionable advice and partially matching the git diff but being incomplete and partially relevant.",
