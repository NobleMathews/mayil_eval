    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `AnchorCheckParser` class and modifying the `handle_starttag` method to handle both `#user-content-make-changes` and `#make-changes` style anchors. It also suggests re-enabling the URL rewrite handler for GitHub anchors and ensuring that the `rewrite_github_anchor` function can handle both styles of anchors correctly.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not closely match the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves emitting a new event 'linkcheck-process-uri' and connecting a new function 'rewrite_github_anchor' to this event to handle the rewriting of GitHub anchors. The RESPONSE does mention uncommenting the `app.connect('linkcheck-process-uri', rewrite_github_anchor)` line, which aligns with the git diff, but it does not mention the addition of the new event or the new function that is actually responsible for the rewriting logic.\n\nMoreover, the RESPONSE suggests changes to the `AnchorCheckParser` class, which is not present in the git diff, indicating a different approach to the solution. The RESPONSE also includes a significant amount of code and references to specific lines in a repository, which are not directly related to the git diff provided.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and it introduces elements that are not part of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
