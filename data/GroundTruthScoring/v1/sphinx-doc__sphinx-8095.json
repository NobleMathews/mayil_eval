    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the docstring to avoid using quotes around `default` in the type hint, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by adding a configuration option `napoleon_preprocess_types` and modifying the code to conditionally preprocess types based on this option. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes made in the git diff and instead focuses on altering the docstring format, which is not the solution implemented in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to unrelated code snippets, which do not contribute to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it attempts to address the warning issue, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach.",
