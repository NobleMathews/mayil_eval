    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `AlterField` operation and only using the `RenameField` operation, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff indicates that an additional `AlterField` operation is necessary before the `RenameField` operation to handle the case where `db_column` is not the same as the old field name. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the need for this additional operation, which is crucial for the issue at hand.\n\nMoreover, the RESPONSE includes a section titled 'Code snippets to check' with links to various parts of the Django codebase. While this might be somewhat relevant for a developer looking to understand the broader context, it does not provide actionable guidance for fixing the issue described. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the `generate_altered_fields` method and the `reduce` method in `fields.py`, which are key to resolving the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it recognizes the need to address the unnecessary SQL generation during field renaming. However, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and fails to address the specific changes needed to resolve the issue correctly. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
