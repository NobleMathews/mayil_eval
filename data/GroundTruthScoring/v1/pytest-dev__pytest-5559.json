    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or provides a valid alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing `xfail_strict=true` or setting it to `false`, which does not align with the git diff and does not address the issue of stepwise not working with xfail strict failures. The git diff shows that the check for 'xfail' in report.keywords has been removed, allowing the stepwise plugin to continue working even with xfail strict failures. The RESPONSE also suggests updating `tests/test_foo.py` to remove the `@pytest.mark.xfail` decorator or adjust the reason, which is not related to the git diff or the issue described. The RESPONSE's suggestion to consider removing `pytest-runner` from `setup_requires` is unrelated to the issue at hand and does not provide a solution to the stepwise plugin problem. Lastly, the RESPONSE's mention of `--trusted-host` is not relevant to the issue or the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue of stepwise not working with xfail strict failures.",
