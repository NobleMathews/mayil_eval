    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the 'autodoc_typehints' setting, updating Sphinx, and potentially reporting the issue to the Sphinx project. It also suggests modifying the Sphinx codebase to address the issue but does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows specific changes to the Sphinx extension 'autodoc' to check for the 'autodoc_typehints' setting before using overloaded function signatures. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes needed in the code, as shown in the git diff, and instead provides general advice that would not resolve the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the problem with 'autodoc_typehints' and overloaded functions, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff.",
