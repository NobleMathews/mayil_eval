    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to modify the `set_tight_layout` method in the `Figure` class to set the layout engine to `None` when the argument is `False`. This aligns with the intent of the git diff to address the issue of toggling `set_tight_layout`. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of using a string ('tight' or 'none') instead of `None` to control the layout engine. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the file and method to be modified but does not provide the exact changes needed, such as the introduction of `_tight` variable and the modification of the `set_layout_engine` call. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `set_layout_engine` accepts `'none'` as a valid input, which is a reasonable assumption but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and provides some guidance but does not fully align with the git diff's solution.",
