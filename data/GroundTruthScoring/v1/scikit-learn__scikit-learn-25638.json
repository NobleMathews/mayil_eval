    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `unique_labels` function to handle nullable pandas dtypes and to ensure that the function does not raise a `ValueError` when encountering these dtypes. It also recommends modifying the type checking logic and adjusting the `_unique_multiclass` function if necessary. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows changes to the `is_multilabel` and `type_of_target` functions in `multiclass.py` using `check_array` with specific keyword arguments to handle the conversion of input arrays without raising deprecation warnings or errors. The RESPONSE does not mention the use of `check_array` or the specific keyword arguments that are crucial to the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using pandas type checking functions, which is not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need to handle nullable pandas dtypes without errors, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
