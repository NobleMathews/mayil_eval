{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the `--update` flag for the `makemigrations` management command in Django, which is the issue at hand. It correctly suggests modifying the `add_arguments` method to add the new flag and outlines the necessary checks and updates to the migration file, which aligns with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use `MigrationOptimizer` and to update the migration's name, which is consistent with the git diff. Additionally, it provides a high-level code outline that matches the logic in the git diff, such as retrieving the latest migration, checking if it can be updated, and writing the updated migration file.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the exact code changes shown in the git diff, such as the specific error messages and the detailed implementation of the `write_to_last_migration_files` method. While the RESPONSE does not need to match the git diff exactly, the lack of these details is why it does not score a 10.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that would assist a developer in implementing the `--update` flag, closely matching the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
