    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE offers a solution that is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but does not align with the git diff and lacks actionable content that would lead to the resolution of the problem as per the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `simplify` function without the `evalf` method, which is a relevant suggestion for simplifying expressions in SymPy. However, the RESPONSE does not address the actual problem in the code that is causing the incorrect simplification, which is related to the implementation of the `_eval_evalf` method in the `sympy.core.operations` module.\n\nThe git diff shows that the issue is resolved by modifying the `_eval_evalf` method to ensure that the expression is correctly simplified. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes to the SymPy library itself, which is what the git diff indicates is necessary to fix the issue.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses simplification in SymPy, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It does not help the developer to locate or fix the issue in the SymPy library that is causing the incorrect simplification. As a result, the RESPONSE is scored as a 1.",
