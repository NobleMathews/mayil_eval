    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new `Collation` class and extending Django field classes to accept a `collation` parameter, which is a reasonable approach to implementing custom collations. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows a comprehensive implementation of collation support across various Django database backends and core Django field types. The git diff includes changes to the database features, introspection, schema, and field initialization to support collations, which the RESPONSE does not address.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a high-level overview of how to implement custom collations, but it lacks the depth and specificity of the git diff. It does not mention the necessary updates to the database backend features or the handling of collations in the schema editor as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and references to Django's codebase that are not directly related to the git diff's changes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach to the issue but fails to offer actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. It does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of collation support to the `CharField` and `TextField` or the updates to the database backend features and schema editor. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
