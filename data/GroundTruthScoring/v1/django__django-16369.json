    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue of filtering sitemap items by language. It suggests modifying the `Sitemap` class to generate URLs only for items translated into the requested language, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of the `get_languages_for_item` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the `_items` method to create tuples only for items with a translation in `lang_code`, which is reflected in the git diff's change to the list comprehension within the `_items` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE's suggestion to handle cases where a URL does not exist for a given language by skipping the item or providing a default URL is in line with the git diff's conditional check for `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` in the `_urls` method. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation of the `get_languages_for_item` method or the exact changes to the `_urls` method, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not capture all the details of the git diff, which prevents it from scoring a perfect 10.",
