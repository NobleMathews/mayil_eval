{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of `lambdify` not working with certain `MatrixSymbol` names even when `dummify=True`. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `lambdify` function to handle `MatrixSymbol` names with special characters and suggests using `Dummy` symbols as a replacement for invalid Python identifiers, which is in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests using the `str.isidentifier()` method to check for valid Python identifiers, which is a reasonable approach, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly reference the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the import addition of `MatrixSymbol` and the conditional check for `MatrixSymbol` instances, but it does align with the overall goal of the git diff to handle `MatrixSymbol` names correctly. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
