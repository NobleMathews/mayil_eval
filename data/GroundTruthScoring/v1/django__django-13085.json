    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a method to check if the `.mo` file is outdated compared to the `.po` file, which aligns with the git diff's approach to only compile `.po` files into `.mo` files if they have been modified. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `compile_messages` function, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to this function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff's implementation details. The git diff uses the `pathlib` module for file path operations and introduces a more concise way of handling file paths and checking modification times. The RESPONSE sticks with the `os` module and does not include the use of `pathlib`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the detailed error handling and messaging that the git diff provides, such as the specific message for when a file is already compiled and up to date.\n\nThe RESPONSE also does not address the removal of the `is_writable` function or its modification to avoid altering `mtime`, which is a point mentioned in the issue description. The git diff addresses this by checking writability without modifying the file.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a partial solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and the specific improvements made in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff.",
