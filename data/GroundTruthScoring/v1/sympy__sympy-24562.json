    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `Rational` class constructor and ensuring correct handling of string inputs, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by introducing a new variable `Q` to accumulate the product of the denominators and then assigning it to `q` at the end, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking for changes between Sympy versions 1.8 and 1.11.1 and possibly reverting a change, which is not directly related to the specific fix shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises adding or modifying unit tests, which is good practice but does not address the actual code change needed to fix the issue.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for further investigation, which could be helpful for a developer but does not offer a solution or directly address the fix required as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to resolve the issue effectively.",
