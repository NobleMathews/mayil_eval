    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Message` class constructor to set a default value of an empty string for `extra_tags`, updating the `MessageEncoder.default` method to always include `extra_tags` in the serialized message, and updating the `MessageDecoder.process_messages` method to handle the case where `extra_tags` is an empty string. Additionally, it suggests ensuring that the `Message` class's `_prepare` method sets `extra_tags` to an empty string if it's `None`.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix implemented was much simpler: it only involved changing the condition in the `MessageEncoder.default` method to check if `extra_tags` is not `None` instead of checking its truthiness. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `Message` class constructor and the `_prepare` method is unnecessary and does not align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `MessageDecoder.process_messages` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff, indicating that this change might not be necessary for fixing the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does address the issue of `extra_tags` being incorrectly serialized/deserialized when it's an empty string, but it does so in a way that is more complex and less aligned with the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
