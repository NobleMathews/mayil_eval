    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests general troubleshooting steps such as verifying documentation, checking the Sphinx configuration, and upgrading Sphinx, which are not related to the specific changes in the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file, specifically adjusting the logic to correctly identify and document special members. The RESPONSE, however, directs the developer to check unrelated code snippets in `napoleon/__init__.py`, `autosummary/generate.py`, and `coverage.py`, which do not address the issue of special members not being documented. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention any code changes or provide insights into the underlying problem with the documentation of special members, making it entirely unhelpful for resolving the issue described.",
