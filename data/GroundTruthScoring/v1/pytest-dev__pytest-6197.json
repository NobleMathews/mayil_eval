    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the issue described, which is about pytest incorrectly collecting `__init__.py` files as test cases. Instead, it suggests workarounds that do not resolve the underlying problem, such as removing assertions from `__init__.py` files or using a different pytest version. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable guidance related to the changes shown in the git diff, which involves modifying the pytest codebase to prevent the collection of `__init__.py` files. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to a code snippet that does not exist, further indicating a lack of relevance to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any value in assisting the developer to fix the issue as per the git diff provided.",
