    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `lru_cache` decorator and implementing manual caching using Django's caching framework. While this is a workaround to the issue, it does not align with the git diff provided, which solves the problem by modifying the `getfullargspec` function to `unwrap` the function before inspecting it. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of allowing the use of decorators like `lru_cache` with Django's template library tags. Instead, it provides an alternative that bypasses the use of such decorators entirely. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need for caching but fails to provide a solution that would allow the use of `lru_cache` or similar decorators, which is the essence of the issue described.",
