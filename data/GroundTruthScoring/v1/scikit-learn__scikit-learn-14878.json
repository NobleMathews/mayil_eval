    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests various updates to the `SimpleImputer` class, including handling non-numeric data, reviewing the `check_array` function, and using `X.dtypes` instead of `X.dtype`. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff, which specifically changes the error handling in the `_validate_input` method to raise a more informative error message when a conversion error occurs. The RESPONSE repeats the same point about `X.dtype` and `X.dtypes` multiple times without providing a clear solution, and it does not address the actual change made in the git diff, which is to raise a new `ValueError` with a clearer message and use exception chaining (`raise new_ve from None`). Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a large amount of repeated text, which does not add value to the developer looking to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff.",
