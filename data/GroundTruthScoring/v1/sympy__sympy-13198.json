    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows changes in the 'factortools.py' file, which involve modifying the way coefficients and factors are handled during polynomial factoring to correct the factoring error. The RESPONSE, however, suggests generic troubleshooting steps such as upgrading SymPy, using different arguments with `sp.factor()`, and reporting the issue if it persists. These suggestions do not reflect the specific changes made in the git diff and do not provide a solution to the problem of incorrect polynomial factoring. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippet references that do not pertain to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
