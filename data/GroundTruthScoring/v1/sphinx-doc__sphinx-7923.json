    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying and adjusting the content of `rst_epilog`, ensuring the correct environment for `make gettext`, reviewing `.rst` files for syntax issues, and investigating Sphinx extensions or custom scripts. However, none of these suggestions align with the git diff, which shows a code change in the `append_epilog` function of the `sphinx/util/rst.py` file to correctly handle the line numbers and sources in the `.pot` files.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed to fix the issue, which involves modifying how the `content` object is appended to when `epilog` is present. Instead, it provides general troubleshooting steps that are not directly related to the code change shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE references checking code snippets in `i18n.py`, which is not relevant to the fix required in `rst.py` as per the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue of bad refs in `.pot` files when using `rst_epilog`. It fails to assist the developer in fixing the issue as per the git diff provided.",
