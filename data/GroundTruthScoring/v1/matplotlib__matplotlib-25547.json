    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff. It fails to address the specific issue described and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests handling masked or NaN values in color arrays for `plt.scatter` and provides a code snippet for this purpose. However, the git diff indicates that the issue is related to the `_safe_first_finite` function in `cbook.py` and the `_convert_dx` function in `axes/_axes.py`, which handle the conversion of non-finite elements differently when all elements are non-finite versus when only some are. The RESPONSE does not address these functions or the changes made to them in the git diff, and therefore does not provide relevant guidance to resolve the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that are not related to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a valid, effective alternative solution.",
