{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the `never_cache` decorator being used incorrectly on instance methods and suggests the correct use of `method_decorator` to fix the issue, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly advises importing `method_decorator` from `django.utils.decorators` and `never_cache` from `django.views.decorators.cache`, which matches the git diff's changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides code snippets and references to the relevant parts of the Django codebase, which would be very helpful for a developer looking to understand the context and implement the fix. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not include the additional changes made in the `cache.py` file to add type checks and raise `TypeError` if the decorators do not receive an `HttpRequest` object. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall utility of the RESPONSE in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
