    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of checks and verifications in the codebase, specifically targeting functions that might be related to the issue described. However, it does not provide any actionable solution or code changes that would resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows a specific change in the `rc_context` function within `__init__.py` to prevent the backend from being reset by the context manager. The RESPONSE fails to mention the specific change needed in `rc_context` and instead provides a general debugging approach. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the broader context of the issue, it lacks actionable content that would lead to a resolution and does not closely match the git diff.",
