    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to add a `deselected` parameter to `pytester.RunResult.assert_outcomes()` and includes a pseudo-code example that is somewhat aligned with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE suggests adding `deselected=None` as a default value, which does not match the git diff that specifies `deselected: int = 0`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the exact changes to the `assert_outcomes()` method implementation and the corresponding unit tests as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also omits the changes to the `pytester_assertions.py` file, which are part of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and provides some useful guidance, it is incomplete and does not fully align with the git diff.",
