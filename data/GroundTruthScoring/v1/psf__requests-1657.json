    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed solution to the issue of session hooks being overwritten by request hooks. It suggests modifying the 'merge_hooks' function with a new implementation that ensures the hooks from both the request and session are combined uniquely, which aligns closely with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE's code snippet is slightly different from the git diff but achieves the same goal of properly merging the hooks without overwriting them. The RESPONSE also includes a rationale for the changes and additional code snippets to check, which are relevant to understanding the context of the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that the RESPONSE's implementation details differ slightly from the git diff, such as using set operations to combine the hooks uniquely, whereas the git diff uses a conditional approach to determine which hooks to return. However, this alternative approach is still valid and effective, so the RESPONSE scores a 9.",
