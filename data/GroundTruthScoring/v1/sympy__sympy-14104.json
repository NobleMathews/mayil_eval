    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if `arg.binding` is `None` before performing a comparison in the `__mul__` method to prevent the `TypeError`. This is a reasonable suggestion for avoiding the error, but it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by changing `stringPict` to `prettyForm` in the `_print_DiracDelta` method of the `pretty.py` file, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve correcting the class used for formatting the output. Instead, it focuses on handling `None` values in a multiplication method that is not directly related to the issue described in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses error handling in pretty printing, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section with code snippets to check, which are not directly relevant to the specific issue at hand and do not provide additional value in resolving the TypeError described. The RESPONSE does not directly help the developer locate or fix the issue as per the git diff, so it receives a low score.",
