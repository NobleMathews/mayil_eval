    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the evaluation of an infinite product and suggests adding a special case to handle the specific form of the product. However, the proposed solution is to hardcode a check for the specific form of the product and return `sinc(a)` if the condition is met. This approach is not aligned with the git diff, which suggests a more general solution by refactoring the `_eval_product` method to factor terms before evaluating the product. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying problem in the `_eval_product` method and instead proposes a workaround that would not be scalable or maintainable for other similar issues. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the file and the class where the issue resides, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to refactoring the code for a more general solution. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
