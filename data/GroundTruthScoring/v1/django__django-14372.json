    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `FieldFile.save` method and the use of `validate_file_name` to sanitize the filename. It also correctly identifies the need to update the `pre_save` method to pass only the basename of the file to `FieldFile.save`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific changes made. The git diff shows that `validate_file_name` has been modified to accept an additional parameter `allow_relative_path` and that the `generate_filename` method in `django/db/models/fields/files.py` is where `validate_file_name` is called with `allow_relative_path=True`. The RESPONSE suggests calling `validate_file_name` with `allow_relative_path=False` in the `FieldFile.save` method, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of `pathlib` and the specific checks for absolute paths and path traversal attempts that are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers some actionable advice, it does not closely match the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
