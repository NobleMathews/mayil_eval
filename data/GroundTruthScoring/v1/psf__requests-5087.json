    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code solution that aligns closely with the git diff. It suggests initializing a variable to store the exception and re-raising the stored exception if it exists when accessing `response.content` again. This approach is effectively the same as the git diff, which also introduces a `_error` attribute to store the exception and re-raises it in the `content` property and the `generate` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes the correct location to modify (`Response.content` property) and the correct mechanism to store and re-raise the exception, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific code changes, but it achieves the same result, which is to ensure that the same exception is re-raised on subsequent accesses to `response.content` after an initial error.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional context by suggesting code snippets to check, which could be helpful for the developer to understand the broader context of the issue. However, it does not mention the changes in the `generate` method, which are also part of the git diff, hence the score is not a perfect 10.",
