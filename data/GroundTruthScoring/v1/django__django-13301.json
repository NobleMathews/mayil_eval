    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `get_default_username` function to accept a `database` parameter and to use this parameter when checking for existing usernames. This matches the changes made in the git diff to the `__init__.py` file.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises modifying the `createsuperuser` command to pass the `database` option to the `get_default_username` function, which aligns with the changes in the `createsuperuser.py` file in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests verifying that the `database` option is correctly parsed and stored, as well as ensuring that the `createsuperuser` command uses the `database` option when creating the superuser. These are relevant and necessary steps to ensure the issue is fully resolved, although they are not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific changes to the `get` method within the `get_default_username` function, which are present in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's guidance implicitly covers this by advising to use the `database` parameter when checking for existing usernames.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that would enable a developer to fix the issue effectively, closely matching the git diff. It only misses a direct reference to the specific change in the `get` method call, which prevents a perfect score of 10.",
