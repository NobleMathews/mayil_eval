    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `contribute_to_class` method in the `ImageField` class to conditionally connect the `post_init` signal, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also includes an additional step to disconnect the `post_init` signal when `width_field` and `height_field` are not set, which is not present in the git diff but is a reasonable action to ensure that the signal is not connected unnecessarily. This additional step does not conflict with the git diff and could be considered a good practice, although it is not strictly necessary for solving the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the relevant code snippets and provides a clear explanation of their relevance to the issue. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the RESPONSE includes an extra step of disconnecting the signal, which, while not incorrect, is not reflected in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the value of the RESPONSE.",
