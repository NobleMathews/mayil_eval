{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the file and location within the Django codebase where the issue originates, which is consistent with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the logic that determines when to generate a `ForeignKey` versus a `OneToOneField`, which is the core of the issue and aligns with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also mentions adjusting the condition to generate a `OneToOneField` when a unique constraint is detected, which is a key part of the solution shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the need to add `models.DO_NOTHING` for the `on_delete` parameter, which is included in the git diff. However, it does suggest removing or adjusting the logic that triggers the `fields.W342` warning, which is indirectly related to the `on_delete` behavior.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative approach to the git diff, focusing on the same key elements of the issue and offering a solution that would likely resolve the problem effectively. It does not match the git diff exactly but provides a similar and valid solution.",
