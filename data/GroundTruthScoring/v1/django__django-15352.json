    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of cleansing session IDs from error reports.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing or updating a `cleanse_sensitive_info` function and ensuring that error logging mechanisms call this function to remove session IDs from error messages. While the RESPONSE does address the general idea of cleansing sensitive information from error reports, it does not align with the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows that the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class has been modified to include session IDs in the list of `hidden_settings` and to add a new method `get_safe_cookies` to cleanse cookies, including session IDs. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `hidden_settings` regex or adding a new method for cleansing cookies. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing and integrating changes from a patch, which is a good practice, but it does not provide specific guidance on how to implement the changes in the context of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
