    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the division by zero problem in the `davies_bouldin_score` function by suggesting to check for zeros in `centroid_distances` and replacing them with a small positive value before the division operation. This approach is a viable alternative to the git diff, which also addresses the division by zero issue but uses `np.inf` instead of a small positive value. The RESPONSE's suggestion to replace zeros with `np.finfo(float).eps` is a common practice to avoid division by zero errors and is a valid solution. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, as it suggests using a small positive value instead of infinity, but it achieves the same goal of preventing division by zero and ensuring the function returns a meaningful score. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
