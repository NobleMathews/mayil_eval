    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `post_process` method to ensure each file is only yielded once, which aligns with the goal of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff introduces a mechanism to collect adjustable files and yield them at the end, ensuring that each file is only yielded once with its final, hashed name. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests removing the loop that yields from `processed_adjustable_paths.values()` and instead yielding each item immediately after processing, which contradicts the git diff's approach of collecting and yielding at the end. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes several points that are not supported by the git diff, such as updating the `ManifestFilesMixin`'s `post_process` method and the `save_manifest` method, which are not part of the issue or the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, but these do not add value in terms of fixing the issue as they do not correspond to actionable changes. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant suggestions but fails to align closely with the git diff and introduces changes that are not supported by the git diff.",
