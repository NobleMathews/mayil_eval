    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `format` function in `django/utils/numberformat.py` to handle small decimals correctly. It also correctly identifies the need to respect the `decimal_pos` parameter and to avoid scientific notation for small numbers, which aligns with the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of adding a specific cutoff check to handle numbers smaller than the smallest visible decimal place. Instead, it suggests a more general approach to string formatting and padding with zeros, which may not directly address the problem of small numbers being formatted in scientific notation. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests removing or commenting out the block that checks for scientific notation, but the git diff does not indicate that this block should be removed; it only adds a new condition before the existing scientific notation logic. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not closely match the git diff's specific solution and is therefore incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
