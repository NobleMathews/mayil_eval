    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to check if 'A' and 'B' have the same dimension order and to reorder one of the DataArrays if necessary before performing the in-place addition. This advice is relevant to the issue, as the problem arises from the DataArrays having the same coordinates but in a different order. The RESPONSE also offers a code snippet to reorder the dimensions using `transpose` or `reindex_like`, which is a viable solution to the problem described in the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff adds error handling within the `dataarray.py` file to catch a `MergeError` and provide a more informative error message when in-place operations fail due to automatic alignment issues. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `dataarray.py` file or adding error handling, which is a key aspect of the git diff's solution.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff. It provides a workaround for the issue rather than addressing the underlying problem in the codebase, as the git diff does. The RESPONSE is helpful to a developer looking for a quick fix but does not guide them towards implementing the more robust solution shown in the git diff.",
