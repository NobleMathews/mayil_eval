    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed guide on how to add documentation for the `julian2num` and `num2julian` functions to the Matplotlib project. However, the git diff indicates that these functions are being deprecated in version 3.7, and a new class attribute `__getattr__.JULIAN_OFFSET` is being introduced to replace the `JULIAN_OFFSET` constant. The RESPONSE fails to mention the deprecation or the introduction of the new class attribute, which is a significant oversight given the context of the git diff. Instead, it focuses solely on adding documentation for functions that are being deprecated, which would not be helpful for the developer in addressing the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
