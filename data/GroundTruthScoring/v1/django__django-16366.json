    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable guide to drop support for SQLite versions below 3.21.0, which is the main goal described in the ISSUE. It correctly identifies the need to update the `minimum_database_version` in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/features.py` to `(3, 21, 0)`, which aligns with the git diff that updates the version to `(3, 21)`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests removing any compatibility code for SQLite versions below 3.21.0, which is in line with the git diff that removes the `supports_pragma_foreign_key_check` attribute and its associated conditional logic in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`. This indicates an understanding of the need to remove outdated compatibility checks.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation and communicating the breaking change to users, which, while not directly reflected in the git diff, is a relevant and necessary step in the process of dropping support for older software versions.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes a detailed example of removing skips and conditional checks that are not present in the git diff, and it does not mention the update to `can_defer_constraint_checks` to `True`, which is a change made in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not perfectly align with every aspect of the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
