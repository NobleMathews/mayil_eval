    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the 'min_count' parameter is being correctly passed and modifying the 'sum' function to handle integer dtypes separately. It also recommends ensuring that the 'sum' function checks the dtype and only passes 'min_count' if appropriate, and casting the result to float if necessary.\n\nThe git diff shows that the actual fix involved popping the 'min_count' parameter for 'sum' and 'prod' functions when it is not needed and correcting an attribute assignment from 'sum' to 'prod'.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of popping the 'min_count' parameter and instead suggests a more complex solution involving dtype checks and potential casting. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to modifying the 'sum' function in 'xarray/core/_aggregations.py', which is not the file or approach used in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of 'min_count' causing errors, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
