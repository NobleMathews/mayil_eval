    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `update` function to accept the colorbar instance as an additional parameter and to call `update_normal` on the colorbar instance after setting the new colormap and clim. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which implements a more comprehensive solution by modifying the `Normalize` class to use a callback registry, adding properties with setters to handle changes, and updating the `ScalarMappable` and related classes to respond to these changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to address the core issue of the `Normalize` objects not notifying scalar-mappables on changes, which is the main focus of the git diff. Instead, it offers a workaround that is specific to the example provided in the issue description and does not generalize to the broader problem of cache invalidation in `AxesImage`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and does not offer significant value towards fixing the issue as described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the colorbar update issue, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
