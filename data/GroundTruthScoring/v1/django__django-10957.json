    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive guide on how to deprecate the specified functions in the Django codebase, which aligns closely with the git diff provided. It correctly identifies the functions to be deprecated and suggests replacing them with their updated counterparts. The RESPONSE also includes the removal of Python 2 compatibility layers and updating references in comments and documentation, which is in line with the git diff's approach to adding deprecation warnings and replacing the functions.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention adding deprecation warnings, which is a significant part of the git diff. However, it does suggest removing or updating any deprecation warnings related to these functions, which implies awareness of their existence. The RESPONSE also provides helpful links to the code snippets where changes should be made, aiding the developer in locating the relevant code sections.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would enable a developer to deprecate the functions effectively, with only a minor omission regarding the addition of deprecation warnings. Therefore, it receives a score of 9.",
