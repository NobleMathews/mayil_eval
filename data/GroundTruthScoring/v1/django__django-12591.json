    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but may not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests overriding the `delete_queryset` method in the `SessionAdmin` class to implement non-bulk deletion logic, which is a valid workaround for the issue described. However, the git diff provided shows changes to the `_get_base_actions` method in `options.py` to prevent the admin.E130 system check error by ensuring that global admin actions are not replaced by specialized ones per-admin. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the admin.E130 error or the changes made in the git diff to the `_get_base_actions` method. Instead, it provides an alternative solution that might be useful in a different context but does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to delete session objects in a non-bulk mode, which is part of the broader issue, but it fails to provide guidance on the specific changes required to fix the admin.E130 error as shown in the git diff.",
