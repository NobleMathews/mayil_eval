    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to implement `requests.Session` for connection pooling during link checking in the Sphinx `linkcheck` builder, which is aligned with the issue's request. It suggests confirming the lack of connection pooling with a test case and then modifying the `HyperlinkAvailabilityCheckWorker` class to use a `requests.Session` object, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of using a session object.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made. The git diff shows the creation of a `_Session` class that extends `requests.Session` and overrides the `request` method to handle TLS verification and User-Agent header setup. It also shows the removal of the `ignore_insecure_warning` context manager and the integration of its functionality into the `_Session` class. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes, nor does it address the refactoring of the `_retrieval_methods` function into a method within the `HyperlinkAvailabilityCheckWorker` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is not entirely accurate, as it suggests using `self.session.head` and `self.session.get` with a `config` parameter, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the evaluation.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a partial solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and accuracy in matching the specific changes required to resolve the issue.",
