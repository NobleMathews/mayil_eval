    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to rename the `algo` parameter to `engine` in the `layout` function and to update the docstring accordingly. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to search for any usage of the `layout` function with the `algo` parameter and update it to use `engine` instead, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `set_layout_engine` function is compatible with the changes, which is also reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful, although not necessary for the evaluation. The RESPONSE does not directly mention updating the type documentation, which is hinted at in the issue description when it mentions 'how the parameter should be documented / typed.' However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate.",
