    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is related to the `to_string` method not handling the sexagesimal representation of `hourangle` correctly after pickling and unpickling, which is accurate. However, the RESPONSE's proposed solution focuses on implementing or reviewing `__setstate__` and `__getstate__` methods, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `to_string` method and other parts of the code to fix the issue, not related to pickling state methods. The RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the use of `functools.partial`, the change from `is` to `==` for unit comparison, and the restructuring of the `to_string` method to handle different cases more effectively. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. It does, however, correctly identify the component (`to_string` method) where the issue resides, which is why it receives a score of 1 instead of 0.",
