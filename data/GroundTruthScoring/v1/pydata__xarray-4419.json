    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. It suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the `xr.concat` function without providing specific instructions on what changes to make. The RESPONSE also includes links to various code snippets, but these are not directly related to the solution and do not offer clear steps to resolve the issue. The git diff provided a specific change to the `concat.py` file that would preserve the original variable order, which the RESPONSE fails to mention or align with. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the file and function to be modified, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
