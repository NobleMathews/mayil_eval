    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `lookup_allowed` method to handle cases where a foreign key is used as a primary key, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff modifies the condition within the `lookup_allowed` method to check against `model._meta.parents.values()`, `model._meta.auto_field`, and `getattr(prev_field, \"to_fields\", [])`, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests appending to `relation_parts` if the field is a primary key and has a `remote_field`, which is a different approach and does not address the specific changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the proposed solution, which does not add actionable value in the context of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
