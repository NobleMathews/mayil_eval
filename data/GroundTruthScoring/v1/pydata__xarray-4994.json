    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding the `date` attribute to the `DatetimeAccessor` class and implementing the `date` property to return the date part of the datetime object. This aligns with the issue's request for a `date` attribute and provides actionable advice on how to implement it. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of raising an AttributeError when accessing the `date` attribute on a `CFTimeIndex` object and instead suggests implementing functionality to return the date part. The RESPONSE also does not include the addition of the `date` property to the `Properties` class, which is present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, it does not fully align with the git diff's solution and is incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
