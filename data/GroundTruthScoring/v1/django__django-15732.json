    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a method for removing the `unique_together` constraint by altering the model's `Meta` class and creating a migration to remove the constraint using `RemoveConstraint`. However, the git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the Django backend schema code to handle the deletion of composed indexes and unique constraints more accurately, especially when multiple constraints exist on the same fields. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue in the Django backend code, which is the focus of the git diff. Instead, it provides a workaround at the model and migration level, which may not be effective given the nature of the issue described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it deals with the removal of constraints, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
