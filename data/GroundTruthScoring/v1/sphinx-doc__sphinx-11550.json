    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests avoiding multiline lambdas or refactoring them into single-line lambdas or regular functions. However, this advice does not align with the git diff, which provides a code update to handle multiline lambdas correctly within the Sphinx autodoc extension. The git diff introduces a new function `_get_arguments` to parse the original code for an object and returns an 'ast.arguments' node, along with other changes to handle the specific case of multiline lambdas in properties. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes needed in the Sphinx extension and instead suggests a workaround that is not reflected in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
