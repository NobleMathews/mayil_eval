    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general troubleshooting steps for issues related to Sphinx documentation not generating links for parameterized types, such as verifying the Sphinx configuration and checking for updates or known issues. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core issue described in the original issue. The git diff shows code changes to the Sphinx source code that directly address the problem of linking parameterized types like `Literal` in the generated documentation. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests checking the Sphinx configuration and upgrading Sphinx, which are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not part of the solution and do not provide actionable value in the context of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
