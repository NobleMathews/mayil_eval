    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests aligning the default 'init' parameter value of 'non_negative_factorization' with 'NMF' by setting it to 'None', which is consistent with the git diff. It also correctly identifies the need to implement a deprecation warning, which is reflected in the git diff where a FutureWarning is added. The RESPONSE further suggests updating the '_parameter_constraints' dictionary and adding a conditional check to handle 'init=None', which is in line with the git diff's approach of adding a conditional to handle 'init=\"warn\"'. The RESPONSE also advises users to explicitly set 'init=\"random\"' to preserve current behavior, which is a helpful suggestion for maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific change of the default value from 'random' to 'warn' in the 'non_negative_factorization' function signature, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a detailed explanation and code snippets that are not directly related to the actionable steps needed to resolve the issue, which could potentially distract from the main solution. Despite these minor discrepancies, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
