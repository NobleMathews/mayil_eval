    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a review of the `exists()` method and proposes a modification based on the presence of `q.distinct` and slice marks (`q.high_mark` and `q.low_mark`). While this is somewhat aligned with the issue's description of optimizing `.exists()` for distinct, non-sliced querysets, it does not match the git diff's approach. The git diff specifically modifies the condition to check for `q.distinct` and `q.is_sliced`, not `q.high_mark` or `q.low_mark`. The RESPONSE fails to mention `q.is_sliced` and instead introduces `q.high_mark` and `q.low_mark`, which are not part of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide a concrete code change but rather a general strategy, lacking actionable content. The provided code snippets are somewhat relevant but do not directly address the change needed in the `exists()` method as per the git diff.",
