    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__repr__` method of the `Partition` class and storing the input type during initialization to change the printing behavior. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution involves changing the `FiniteSet` representation to a set literal `{}` directly in the return statements of various functions and classes throughout the SymPy library. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to `singularities`, `stationary_points`, `intersection`, `objects`, and other methods across multiple files. Instead, it focuses on a specific implementation detail (modifying `__repr__` and storing input type) that is not part of the git diff's approach. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer an effective alternative solution.",
