    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of the issue and suggests a modification to the `RoundFunction` class's `eval` method to handle nested `floor` and `ceiling` expressions. It also recommends adding test cases to verify the correct behavior. However, the RESPONSE's proposed solution does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff adds a specific condition to handle instances of `floor` and `ceiling` directly within the `eval` method, whereas the RESPONSE suggests a more generic check for instances of `cls`, which could be any `RoundFunction` and not specifically `floor` or `ceiling`. This could lead to incorrect behavior for other rounding functions that are not `floor` or `ceiling`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the actual code change that was made in the git diff, which is to return `ipart + spart` when `spart` is an instance of `floor` or `ceiling`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to return `cls(arg.args[0])` when `arg` is an instance of `cls` is a different approach and does not directly address the issue of nested `floor` and `ceiling` functions not fully evaluating. The RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice and partially addresses the issue, but it is incomplete and only partially relevant, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
