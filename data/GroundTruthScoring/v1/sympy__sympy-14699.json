    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `orientnew` method in the `ReferenceFrame` class to handle the `indices` parameter, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `indices` parameter should be passed to the `ReferenceFrame` constructor within the `orientnew` method, as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and includes code snippets, which are helpful for understanding where the changes should be made. It also correctly states that no changes are required in the `ReferenceFrame` constructor since it already handles the `indices` parameter.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a suggestion to ensure that the `indices` parameter is properly documented in the `orientnew` method docstring, which is a valuable addition for maintaining the codebase, even though it is not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, providing a near-perfect solution to the issue described.",
