{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the `normalize` parameter in the `confusion_matrix` function, which is the core of the issue. It correctly suggests modifying the function signature to include the `normalize` parameter and implementing the normalization logic within the function. The RESPONSE also advises updating the documentation and adding unit tests, which are good practices for contributing to an open-source project like scikit-learn.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed code changes closely align with the git diff, including the normalization logic and the handling of different normalization options ('true', 'pred', 'all', None). The RESPONSE also correctly suggests raising a ValueError for invalid `normalize` values, which is in line with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the changes to the `plot_confusion_matrix` function in `sklearn/metrics/_plot/confusion_matrix.py`, which are present in the git diff. However, since the RESPONSE focuses on the primary issue of adding the `normalize` parameter to the `confusion_matrix` function and provides a comprehensive solution for that, it is still highly relevant and valuable. The RESPONSE's omission of the `plot_confusion_matrix` changes does not significantly detract from its utility in assisting a developer to fix the issue, hence the score of 9.",
