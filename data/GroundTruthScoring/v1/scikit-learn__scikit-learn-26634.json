    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that partially aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_fit_transform` method to handle the case where `update_H` is `False` and `H` is provided by setting `self._n_components` to `H.shape[0]`. This is in line with the git diff, which also adjusts the handling of `n_components` when `H` is provided. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of the 'auto' option for `n_components` nor the deprecation warning for the default value change, which are significant parts of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the changes to the error messages and the addition of the `Hidden` class, which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE is relevant and provides a partial solution but does not fully capture the scope of changes made in the git diff.",
