    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying a function called `generate_skip_report` and potentially implementing a `resolve_relative_path` function. However, the git diff provided does not mention or modify any `generate_skip_report` function, nor does it implement a `resolve_relative_path` function. Instead, the git diff modifies the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function to use `item.reportinfo()` for obtaining the correct file path and line number, and then formats the `longrepr` with the correct path. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the need to correct the file path in the skip report, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score for its partial relevance but lack of alignment with the git diff.",
