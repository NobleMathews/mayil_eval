    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__init__` method and using a `uniqueLocation` function to remove duplicate locations, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach of sorting and deduplicating the positions in the `__iter__` method. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific change of using a sorted set comprehension within the `__iter__` method, which is the key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking and potentially modifying other methods (`PoFileParser._process_comment()` and `Message.__init__()`), which are not part of the git diff. While these suggestions may be relevant to the broader issue, they do not directly address the specific change made in the git diff. The RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice, but it is incomplete and only partially relevant, as it does not focus on the `__iter__` method where the actual change is made according to the git diff.",
