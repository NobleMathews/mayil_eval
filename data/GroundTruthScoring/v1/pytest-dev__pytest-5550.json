    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the pytest version compatibility, ensuring correct configuration, and considering reporting the issue to the pytest development team if the problem persists. It also suggests a temporary workaround of manually modifying the XML file or using a script to post-process it. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution involves modifying the `junitxml.py` file to wrap the test suite XML nodes with a `<testsuites>` root tag. The RESPONSE does not address the code change needed in the `junitxml.py` file and instead focuses on configuration and potential bugs, which is not aligned with the git diff. The mention of manually modifying the XML file is somewhat relevant as a workaround, but it does not provide a direct solution to the issue as the git diff does. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in guiding the developer to make the necessary code changes to fix the issue.",
