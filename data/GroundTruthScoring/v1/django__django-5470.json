    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and be relevant given the issue and the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `setup` function to use a new setting `GLOBAL_SCRIPT_PREFIX` and updating various functions and settings to use this new prefix. While this approach could potentially solve the issue, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `setup` function is modified to accept a `set_prefix` parameter, which is used to conditionally set the script prefix using `set_script_prefix`. Additionally, the `get_wsgi_application` function in `django/core/wsgi.py` is updated to call `django.setup(set_prefix=False)`. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying `get_wsgi_application` or the use of the `set_prefix` parameter, which are key elements of the git diff. The RESPONSE also introduces a new setting `GLOBAL_SCRIPT_PREFIX`, which is not present in the git diff and adds complexity that may not be necessary. The RESPONSE does not directly address the issue of setting the script prefix in `django.setup()` for use outside of requests, which is the core of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
