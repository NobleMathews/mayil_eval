    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding 'datetime64' to the ECSV_DATATYPES tuple and ensuring that the EcsvHeader class handles the 'datetime64' type when reading and writing ECSV files. While this suggestion is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff does not modify the ECSV_DATATYPES tuple; instead, it introduces a version check to allow backward compatibility for older files that used datatypes not included in the ECSV standard. The RESPONSE does not address the versioning aspect or the backward compatibility workaround implemented in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and would not resolve the issue as described.",
