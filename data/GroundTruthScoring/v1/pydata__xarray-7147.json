    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the issue and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if `cftime` is installed and modifying the `CFDatetimeCoder.decode` method to handle exceptions, which is not directly related to the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves wrapping the `decode_cf_variable` call in a try-except block and raising a more informative error message when an exception occurs. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach but instead suggests modifying the `CFDatetimeCoder.decode` method and handling exceptions differently, which is not aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the need for a more informative error message, which is in line with the git diff's intent to include the variable name in the error message. However, the RESPONSE's approach to achieving this is different and does not provide a clear, actionable solution that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
