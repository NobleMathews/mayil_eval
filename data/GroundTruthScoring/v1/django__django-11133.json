{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `content` setter in the `HttpResponse` class to handle `memoryview` objects by converting them to bytes, which is highly relevant to the issue described. The RESPONSE provides clear guidance on how to implement the change, including a code snippet that demonstrates the necessary modification. This aligns with the git diff's approach of handling `memoryview` objects in the `make_bytes` method by checking if the value is an instance of `memoryview` and converting it to bytes. The RESPONSE's alternative approach of placing the check in the `content` setter is a valid and effective solution that achieves the same result as the git diff, which is to ensure `memoryview` objects are properly converted to bytes. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, which modifies the `make_bytes` method, but it offers a viable alternative that would resolve the issue. Therefore, it is scored as a 7 for providing a relevant and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff's objective.",
