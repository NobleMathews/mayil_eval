    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of case sensitivity in glossary terms within Sphinx documentation. It suggests reviewing the `doc/glossary.rst` file for case sensitivity issues and modifying the `_note_term` method in `sphinx/domains/std.py` to handle case sensitivity properly. This aligns well with the git diff, which shows changes made to the `std.py` file to address the case sensitivity issue by removing the `lowercase=True` parameter from the `XRefRole` and changing the `note_object` method to use the original `termtext` instead of `termtext.lower()`. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific lines of code changed in the git diff, but it does provide a link to the relevant section of the codebase, which is helpful. The RESPONSE's suggestion to implement a custom solution or workaround if necessary is also a valid point, although it was not needed in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
