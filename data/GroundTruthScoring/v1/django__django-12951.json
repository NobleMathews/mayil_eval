    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a workaround for the issue by suggesting the use of a Q object to wrap the Exists expression and other conditions, which is a valid approach to solving the problem. However, the RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed in the When class's __init__ method, as shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the code should be modified to handle the case where both a condition and lookups are provided, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does provide a corrected code snippet for the user's specific example, which is helpful, but it does not guide the developer on how to fix the underlying issue in the Django codebase. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that may be relevant for understanding the context of the issue, but it does not directly help in fixing the issue as per the git diff.",
