    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of troubleshooting steps that are generally related to Sphinx documentation issues but do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the `sphinx.ext.autodoc.mock` module to correctly set the `__name__` and `__qualname__` attributes of mocked objects, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestions to verify `autodoc_mock_imports`, upgrade Sphinx, use `autodoc_class_signature`, check class definitions, disable interfering extensions, or manually document inheritance do not address the specific problem of the mocked classes' base section documentation. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are not directly related to the changes made in the git diff and do not offer a solution to the reported issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored low for its lack of alignment with the git diff and for not providing a viable alternative solution.",
