    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the issue with the `Mod` function and the conflict with Fortran's intrinsic function but fails to provide actionable steps that align with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `autowrap` function or the underlying code generation process, which is a correct direction, but it does not offer specific guidance on how to implement these changes. The git diff, on the other hand, provides concrete changes to the `fcode.py` and `codegen.py` files to handle the `Mod` function correctly and set the Fortran standard to 95, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests that `Mod` is being imported twice, which is not the case according to the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the solution provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable and specific content needed to resolve the issue, warranting a score of 2.",
