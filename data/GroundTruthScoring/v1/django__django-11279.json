    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach to the issue by suggesting modifications to the `BaseConstraint` class and related operations to support string formatting in the `name` attribute. However, it does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `options.py` file, specifically adding a new method `_format_names_with_class` and modifying the `contribute_to_class` method to handle the interpolation of `app_label` and `class` for constraints and indexes. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests changes to the `BaseConstraint` class, `AddConstraint`, and `RemoveConstraint` operations, which are not part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE is related to the issue of allowing `app_label` and `class` to be specified in the name argument for constraints and indexes, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
