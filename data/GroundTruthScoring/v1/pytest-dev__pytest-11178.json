    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but may not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if `pytest.approx` supports comparison with `None` and to consider implementing a check to handle `None` values gracefully. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which adds a check to ensure that both `approx_value.expected` and `other_value` are not `None` before proceeding with the comparison. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement this check in the code, which is a significant part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the test case or modifying `pytest.approx` to handle `None` values, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff focuses on modifying the `_repr_compare` function to prevent the `TypeError`. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, such as the conditional check within the comparison loop, and therefore only partially aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
