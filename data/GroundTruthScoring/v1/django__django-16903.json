    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests checking if the primary key is set before inserting a new record and using `force_update=True` instead of `force_insert=True`, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff shows a modification to the `_save_parents` method, adding an `updated_parents` parameter to track the update status of parent models and prevent duplicate primary key errors. The RESPONSE does not address this solution or provide a viable alternative. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `bulk_create` with `ignore_conflicts=True`, which is not relevant to the issue described and does not appear in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE fails to offer meaningful assistance in resolving the issue and does not align with the git diff, warranting a low score.",
