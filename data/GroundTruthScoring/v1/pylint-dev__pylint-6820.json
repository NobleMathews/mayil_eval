    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the user should be informed about the correct argument and that Pylint should provide an error message indicating the unrecognized argument. However, it does not provide a solution to the actual issue of the CLI silently failing when an incorrect argument is used. The RESPONSE also incorrectly directs attention to the `load_plugin_modules` method and the emission of a `bad-plugin-value` message, which is not related to the issue at hand. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `PREPROCESSABLE_OPTIONS` dictionary to handle abbreviations and incorrect spellings by adding a third element to the tuples indicating how many letters should match. The RESPONSE does not align with this approach and does not offer a viable alternative solution. It does, however, correctly identify the incorrect CLI argument used by the user, which is somewhat relevant to the issue, hence the score of 2.",
