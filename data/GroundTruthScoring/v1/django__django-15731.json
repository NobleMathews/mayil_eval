    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the @wraps decorator from the functools module to ensure that the correct signature is exposed for the bulk_create method. This aligns with the git diff, which also introduces the use of @wraps. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly focuses on decorating the bulk_create method specifically and suggests ensuring it has the correct signature, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff shows that the @wraps decorator is applied in a more generic way to all queryset methods through the create_method function within the _get_queryset_methods class method, not just bulk_create. The RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, which involve removing the manual assignment of __name__ and __doc__ and instead using @wraps to handle all metadata for dynamically created manager methods. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary details about checking code snippets and the structure of the Manager class, which are not relevant to the specific fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
