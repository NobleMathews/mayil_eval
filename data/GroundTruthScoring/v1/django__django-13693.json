    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `get_child_arguments` function to ensure that all elements of the `args` list are converted to strings, which aligns with the git diff's approach of converting `WindowsPath` objects to strings to prevent the `TypeError` when running `django-admin runserver` on Windows with Python versions less than 3.8.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggested code change is to convert all elements in `sys.argv` to strings, which is slightly different from the git diff's approach of specifically converting the `exe_entrypoint` and `script_entrypoint` to strings. However, this difference does not detract from the effectiveness of the RESPONSE's solution, as it achieves the same goal of preventing `WindowsPath` objects from causing a `TypeError`.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the TODO comments about removing the `str()` conversion when dropping support for Python 3.7, which are present in the git diff. These comments are important for future maintainability and indicate the temporary nature of the fix. Despite this omission, the RESPONSE still provides a clear and actionable solution that would resolve the issue effectively.",
