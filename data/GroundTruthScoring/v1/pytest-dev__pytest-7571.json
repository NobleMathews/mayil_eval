    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the `caplog` fixture's `__exit__` method or equivalent teardown logic should be correctly restoring the log level, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach of restoring log levels. However, the RESPONSE does not accurately reflect the changes in the git diff, which involves adding a new attribute `_initial_handler_level` to store the initial handler level and then using it to restore the handler level in the `_finalize` method. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use a context manager with `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods is not supported by the git diff, and it does not provide a direct solution to the issue. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the pytest changelog and using pytest hooks, which are general advice but do not offer specific actionable steps to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
