    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of why there might be difficulties in converting SymPy's `Max` and `Min` functions to other languages, focusing on the symbolic nature of these functions and the potential lack of equivalent capabilities in the target languages. However, it does not offer any actionable guidance or solutions that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the actual solution involved adding mappings for `Max`, `Min`, and other functions to the `known_functions` dictionary in the `rcode.py` file, which is part of SymPy's R code printing functionality. The RESPONSE fails to address this specific solution or provide any alternative that would help in resolving the issue. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in discussing the nature of the problem, it lacks actionable content and does not match the git diff.",
