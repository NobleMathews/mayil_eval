    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying configuration settings and considering an upgrade or reporting a bug if the issue persists. While these are general troubleshooting steps, they do not address the specific code changes needed to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. The git diff provides a concrete solution by modifying the 'sphinx/domains/python.py' file to handle the 'python_use_unqualified_type_names' configuration correctly when 'autodoc_typehints' is set to 'description'. The RESPONSE fails to mention any code changes or modifications to the Sphinx source code, which is the core of the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with the 'python_use_unqualified_type_names' setting but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
