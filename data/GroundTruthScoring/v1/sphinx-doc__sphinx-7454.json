    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the intersphinx extension is loaded and the intersphinx_mapping is correctly set up, which is a prerequisite for linking to external documentation but does not address the specific issue of making 'None' clickable in the signature. The RESPONSE also suggests upgrading Sphinx, which is not relevant to the issue since the problem is with the current version's handling of 'None' and not with the version itself. The RESPONSE does not provide any code changes or specific guidance on how to modify the code to fix the issue, unlike the git diff which provides a specific change to the '_parse_annotation' function to handle 'None' differently by setting the 'reftype' to 'obj' instead of 'class'. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described.",
