    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps and considerations that are somewhat relevant to the issue of the `Value()` function crashing with `DecimalField` on SQLite. It correctly identifies the need to apply `SQLiteNumericMixin` to the `Value` class, which aligns with the git diff provided. However, the RESPONSE also includes several additional suggestions that are not directly related to the git diff, such as checking the `SQLiteDecimalToFloatMixin`, verifying the `create_decimal_from_float` function, and considering the use of `FixDecimalInputMixin`. These suggestions, while potentially useful for a broader investigation, do not directly address the specific change made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests updating Django, which is not related to the git diff's solution. The code snippets provided are somewhat helpful, but they include references to PostgreSQL and GIS models, which are not relevant to the issue at hand. Overall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that aligns with the git diff but also includes extraneous information that does not contribute to resolving the specific issue described.",
