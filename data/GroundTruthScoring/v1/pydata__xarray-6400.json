    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and optimizing the `array_repr` function in `xarray/core/formatting_html.py`, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff indicates changes in `xarray/core/formatting.py`, `xarray/core/indexing.py`, and `xarray/core/options.py`, which are not addressed in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does suggest optimizing the HTML representation and adjusting the level of detail based on the size of the data array, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach of using a threshold to determine when to summarize data. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It also incorrectly refers to a file (`formatting_html.py`) that is not part of the git diff and does not exist in the repository. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and lacks actionable content that would help resolve the issue as described. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
