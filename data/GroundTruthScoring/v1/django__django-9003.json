{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using an OrderedDict or relying on dictionaries maintaining insertion order in Python 3.6+ to ensure determinism, which aligns with the git diff's change of initializing self.alias_map with an OrderedDict. This change is directly aimed at addressing the non-deterministic behavior mentioned in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional guidance on modifying the combine() method to handle circular references and suggests adding logging or debugging to trace modifications to change_map. While these suggestions do not directly match the git diff, they are relevant and could be considered good practices for resolving the issue and preventing similar issues in the future.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific assertion error or the exact location of the combine() method, which is why it does not score higher. However, it does provide actionable advice that is relevant to the issue and aligns with the git diff's approach to making the behavior deterministic.",
