    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat relevant to the issue described. It suggests updating the `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` setting and ensuring that the `set_cookie` and `set_signed_cookie` methods handle the `samesite` parameter correctly. This aligns with the issue's requirement to handle the `samesite` attribute explicitly due to Chrome's new cookie policy. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which specifically updates the `set_cookie` method to accept 'none' as a valid option for the `samesite` parameter and raises a ValueError if the `samesite` value is not one of 'lax', 'none', or 'strict'. The RESPONSE also suggests setting the default value to `'Lax'` or `'Strict'`, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the error message to include 'none' as an option, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing custom middleware or views, which, while potentially useful, is not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and direct relevance to the changes shown in the git diff.",
