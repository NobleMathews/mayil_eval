    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the test functions `check_class_weight_balanced_classifiers` and `check_class_weight_balanced_linear_classifier` are included in the test suite and provides a code snippet to add to the `_yield_classifier_checks` function. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes related to including test functions in a test suite or modifying the `_yield_classifier_checks` function. Instead, the git diff adds an error message to the `assert_allclose` function within the `check_class_weight_balanced_linear_classifier` function to provide a more informative error message when the test fails.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the actual issue of improving the error message in the test assertion, and instead, it focuses on an unrelated aspect of test discovery and inclusion, which is not mentioned in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
