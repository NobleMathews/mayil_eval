    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `__new__` method of the `Pow` class to handle the case where the base is `0` and the exponent is `-oo`, and it suggests adding the exact condition that is present in the git diff:\n\n  if base is S.Zero and exp is S.NegativeInfinity:\n      return S.ComplexInfinity\n\nThis matches the git diff's addition:\n\n  if b is S.Zero and e is S.NegativeInfinity:\n      return S.ComplexInfinity\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises to ensure that `S.Zero` and `S.NegativeInfinity` are imported if not already available, which is a necessary step for the fix to work, although the git diff does not explicitly show this import because it might already be present in the file.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it includes additional advice to review the documentation and the `ComplexInfinity` class, which, while potentially useful, are not part of the git diff's solution. However, these additional points do not detract from the accuracy and relevance of the main solution provided.",
