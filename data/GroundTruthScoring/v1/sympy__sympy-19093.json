    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE suggests that the problem is with the `__add__` method of the `BlockDiagMatrix` class and provides a general approach to fix an addition operation issue. However, the git diff indicates that the problem was more complex and involved multiple changes across various files in the sympy library, including modifications to error handling, matrix expressions, and the handling of block matrices, determinants, and inverses. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of checks for square blocks, handling of 1x1 block matrices, and the use of `_sympify` to ensure proper handling of matrix elements. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
