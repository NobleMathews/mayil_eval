    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and fails to offer any actionable guidance or meaningful information that would assist the developer in resolving the issue. The RESPONSE suggests updating the `.pylintrc` configuration file or command-line arguments, which is not related to the changes in the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the `expand_modules.py` and `pylinter.py` files, including the addition of a new function `_is_in_ignore_list_re` and a new command-line option `ignore-paths`. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes or provide any insights into modifying the code to fix the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests upgrading Pylint or reviewing the `_is_ignored_file` function, which does not exist in the provided git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and misguided, offering no accurate guidance to aid in resolving the issue.",
