{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the changes needed to support DataFrames in `OneHotEncoder` and `OrdinalEncoder` without converting to a contiguous array, which is the core of the issue. It suggests modifying the `_BaseEncoder` class to handle pandas DataFrames column by column and updating the `fit` and `transform` methods accordingly. This approach is aligned with the git diff, which also modifies the `_check_X` method to handle DataFrames differently from other array types and processes each column individually to preserve data types.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes as seen in the git diff but offers a conceptually similar solution by suggesting the creation of new helper methods (`_fit_column` and `_transform_column`) to process each column individually. This alternative approach is valid and could be effective in achieving the same goal as the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the specific implementation details and code changes that are present in the git diff, such as the addition of the `_get_feature` method and the detailed changes within the `_fit` and `_transform` methods. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a clear direction, it is not as detailed and precise as the git diff, which justifies a score of 7.",
