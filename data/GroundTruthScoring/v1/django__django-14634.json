    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new mixin that combines deletion and success message functionalities, which is a relevant approach to the issue of showing a success message on successful object deletion. It also correctly identifies the need to use Django's messaging framework to add the success message to the request, which is in line with the goal of the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `BaseDeleteView` is being modified to include `FormMixin` and a new `post` method, along with `form_valid` and `form_invalid` methods. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests overriding the `delete` method and does not mention the use of `FormMixin` or the `post` method. This indicates that the RESPONSE is not directly implementing the solution as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a partial solution by suggesting the use of a success message mixin, but it does not address the changes to the `BaseDeleteView` class or the introduction of form handling in the deletion process as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
