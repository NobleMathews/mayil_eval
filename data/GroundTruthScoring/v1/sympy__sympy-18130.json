    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue might be with the `diophantine` solver not being able to find solutions for the equation `n**2 - 1 = m`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the `diophantine.py` file, where a multiplication by `g` was missing in the expression `e*sqc**g*z0**2`. The RESPONSE does not mention this detail or provide any guidance on modifying the code to fix the issue. Instead, it suggests checking the `diophantine` function and the conditions in the `intersection.py` file, which is not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a special case for quadratic expressions, which is not supported by the git diff and does not address the specific problem. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and lacks actionable content that would help the developer fix the issue.",
