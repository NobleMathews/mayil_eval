    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `write` method in `django.core.management.base.py` to handle encoding errors gracefully by replacing characters that cannot be encoded with a suitable replacement character. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which shows that the actual fix implemented was to replace the horizontal ellipsis character (`\n2026`) with three periods (`...`) across various files in the Django codebase. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of the ellipsis character causing crashes on Windows due to encoding issues with code page 437. Instead, it suggests a broader change to the encoding handling in Django's output methods, which is not supported by the git diff. The git diff indicates that the preferred solution was to simply replace the problematic character in the output strings, rather than altering the encoding behavior of Django's output methods. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
