    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes suggested in the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests checking various functions and methods such as `sin`, `exp`, `simplify`, `fu`, `sqrtdenest`, and `trigsimp`, but it does not provide specific actionable guidance on what changes need to be made to the code. The git diff, on the other hand, shows specific changes to the `exptrigsimp` function in `trigsimp.py` and the `expander` function in `simplify.py` to address the issue of simplification failing to recognize `sin` expressed as exponentials. The RESPONSE fails to mention these specific changes or provide an alternative solution that would lead to the same result. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue as it does not provide clear, actionable steps or align with the git diff's approach.",
