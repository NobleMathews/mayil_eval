    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_get_deps_info` function to conditionally include `joblib` based on the version of `sklearn`. This approach is more complex than necessary, as the git diff indicates that `joblib` should simply be added to the list of dependencies without any version checks. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the file and function to modify (`sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py` and `_get_deps_info`), but it introduces unnecessary version checking logic. The RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff, which shows a straightforward addition of `joblib` to the dependencies list. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of adding `joblib` but fails to provide the simple and direct solution reflected in the git diff.",
