    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `DEFAULT_PYLINT_HOME` constant in `pylint/constants.py` and using `platformdirs.user_data_dir()` instead of `platformdirs.user_cache_dir()`. However, the git diff shows that the actual change was made in `pylint/config/__init__.py` using `appdirs.user_cache_dir()` instead of `platformdirs.user_data_dir()`. The RESPONSE does not mention the `appdirs` library or the correct file to be modified. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating documentation and implementing a migration strategy, which is not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of making pylint XDG Base Directory Specification compliant, it does not provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and links to check, which are not directly related to the git diff provided.",
