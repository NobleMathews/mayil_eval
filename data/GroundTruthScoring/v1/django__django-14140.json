    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `deconstruct` method in the `Q` class to handle instances of `Exists` and other non-subscriptable children, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff simplifies the deconstruct method by always using args to pass the children and only using kwargs for the connector and negated properties if they differ from the default. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check if a child has its own `deconstruct` method and to call it if so, is not reflected in the git diff and introduces complexity that the git diff avoids. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear, actionable solution that aligns with the git diff's simplification strategy. Therefore, it only partially addresses the issue and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach.",
