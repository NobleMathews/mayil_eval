    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `ResolverMatch.__init__` method to unwrap `functools.partial` objects and modifying the `ResolverMatch.__repr__` method to display the unwrapped function and its arguments. This approach is in line with the issue's requirement to handle `functools.partial` objects more effectively in the `__repr__` output.\n\nThe git diff provided does not modify the `__init__` method but instead directly checks for `functools.partial` in the `__repr__` method and adjusts the output accordingly. While the RESPONSE's approach is different, it is a valid alternative that achieves the same goal of improving the `__repr__` output for `functools.partial` objects.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it introduces additional instance variables (`_partial_func`, `_partial_args`, `_partial_kwargs`) and modifies the `__init__` method, which the git diff does not do. However, these changes are relevant and could be considered an enhancement to the original solution, as they provide a structured way to handle `functools.partial` objects within the class.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses points for not matching the git diff exactly and for potentially introducing more complexity than the git diff's solution. However, it still provides a clear, actionable, and relevant alternative approach to resolving the issue.",
