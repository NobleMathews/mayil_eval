    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests overriding the `value_to_string` method for `JSONField` to ensure it returns a string representation of the JSON data, which is a relevant approach to the issue. It also correctly identifies that the `handle_field` method in `xml_serializer.py` needs to be modified to handle `JSONField` values properly. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the need to import the `json` module, which is crucial for the solution and is included in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes needed for the `_handle_object` method, which are part of the git diff and necessary for the complete solution. The RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and does not cover all the necessary changes. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff.",
