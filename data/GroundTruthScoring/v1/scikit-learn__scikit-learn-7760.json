    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable recommendations that are relevant to the issue of ensuring that `get_params` and `set_params` work correctly with properties that do processing. It suggests modifying the `get_params` and `set_params` methods to handle private attributes and properties correctly, which is aligned with the issue's concern about the common tests passing incorrectly configured estimators. The RESPONSE also recommends adding a test case to check the functionality of `get_params` and `set_params`, which is in line with the git diff that adds a new test `check_set_params`. However, the RESPONSE does not directly reference the changes made in the git diff, such as setting `longMessage = True` in the `TestCase` class or the specific implementation details of the `check_set_params` function. It also includes a somewhat lengthy and unnecessary explanation of where to find relevant code snippets, which does not directly contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue, warranting a score within the 4-6 range.",
