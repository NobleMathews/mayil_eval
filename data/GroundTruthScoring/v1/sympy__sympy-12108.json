    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions that closely align with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the same file and methods as the git diff, and the proposed changes are in line with the git diff's approach to use operators instead of function names for logical expressions. The RESPONSE also emphasizes the importance of correct parenthesization, which is crucial for maintaining the correct evaluation order in the output string.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the `_print_And`, `_print_Or`, and `_print_Not` methods in `sympy/printing/str.py` to use the `&`, `|`, and `~` operators, respectively. This matches the git diff's changes, which also replace the function names with these operators in the str printer. Additionally, the RESPONSE highlights the necessity of proper parenthesization, which is addressed in the git diff by adjusting the precedence values and ensuring the correct use of parentheses in the modified methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly provide the exact code changes from the git diff but offers a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use the `parenthesize` method for correct parenthesization is aligned with the git diff's approach, which also ensures proper operator precedence.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `precedence.py` file, which are part of the git diff and necessary for the correct functioning of the modified printer methods. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the main focus is on the logical expression printing behavior, which is effectively addressed.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a nearly complete solution that would enable a developer to fix the issue with minimal additional guidance. The RESPONSE's emphasis on parenthesization and operator usage is particularly valuable and aligns closely with the git diff's approach.",
