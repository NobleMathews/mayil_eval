    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general best practices and troubleshooting steps for working with Django URL patterns, which are somewhat relevant to the issue at hand. It advises ensuring that `kwargs` is a dictionary and that the `name` argument is a string, which aligns with the issue's description of a TypeError when `kwargs` is not a dict. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or code change to address the issue, unlike the git diff, which includes a code snippet to raise a TypeError if `kwargs` is not a dict. The RESPONSE also includes a lot of additional advice that, while generally useful, does not directly address the issue described. It does not mention modifying the `_path` function to include a type check for `kwargs`, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue, providing some relevant advice but lacking a direct and actionable solution.",
