    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed approach to ensure that the RenameModel operation with db_table defined is a noop. It suggests modifying the database_forwards and database_backwards methods to check if db_table is set and perform a noop if it is, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves checking if the old and new db_table values are the same and returning early if they are, without any mention of self.db_table. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the SQLite and Postgres backend schema implementations, which is a valid point but not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue's intent but does not match the git diff's solution. It provides actionable advice but does not fully align with the git diff's changes, hence a score of 4 is appropriate.",
