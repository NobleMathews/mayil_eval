    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests uncommenting the line `# ax2.set_ylim(bottom=0)` to ensure that the radial scale starts at 0 for both subplots. However, this suggestion does not align with the git diff, which involves changes to the `autoscale_view` method in the `_base.py` file to handle the autoscaling of views more appropriately, especially for log scales and sticky edges.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets in the matplotlib repository, but these snippets are not directly related to the changes made in the git diff. The git diff modifies the internal behavior of the autoscaling mechanism, while the RESPONSE focuses on user-level code adjustments and does not address the underlying issue described.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, it does not assist the developer in fixing the issue and warrants a score of 0.",
