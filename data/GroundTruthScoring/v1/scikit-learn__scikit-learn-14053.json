    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `feature_names` parameter matches the number of features the `DecisionTreeClassifier` was trained on, which is a valid point but does not address the root cause of the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to handle the case where `tree_.feature` contains `_tree.TREE_UNDEFINED`, which is the actual cause of the `IndexError` as shown in the git diff. The git diff shows that the code has been modified to check if the index `i` is not `_tree.TREE_UNDEFINED` before accessing `feature_names[i]`. The RESPONSE fails to identify this key aspect of the solution and instead focuses on the length of `feature_names`, which is not the issue here. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the `export_text` function and the `feature_names` parameter, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
