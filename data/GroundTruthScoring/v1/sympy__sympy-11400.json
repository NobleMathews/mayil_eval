    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the addition of a custom implementation for the `sinc` function in the `known_functions_C89` and `known_functions_C99` dictionaries and updating the `_print_sinc` method. This aligns with the git diff's approach of handling the `sinc` function by providing a custom print method. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of using a `Piecewise` function to handle the `sinc` function within the `_print_sinc` method itself. Instead, it suggests implementing the `sinc` function in C and updating the `_print_sinc` method to use this custom C implementation. While this is a valid alternative approach, it does not directly align with the git diff's solution, which does not involve modifying the `known_functions_C89` and `known_functions_C99` dictionaries or creating a separate C implementation of `sinc`. The RESPONSE also includes additional information about code snippets to check, which is helpful but not directly related to the git diff's changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers actionable advice but does not fully match the git diff's approach.",
