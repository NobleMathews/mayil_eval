    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `tripcolor` function to handle the `clim` parameter correctly. It correctly identifies the need to set `vmin` and `vmax` before calling `_scale_norm`, which is in line with the git diff's approach to handling normalization. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific changes made to the code. The git diff shows changes to the instantiation of `TriMesh` and `PolyCollection` with the inclusion of `alpha`, `array`, `cmap`, and `norm` parameters, as well as the removal of separate setters for these properties. The RESPONSE does not mention these changes and instead focuses on handling the `clim` parameter, which is not directly addressed in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests popping `clim` from `kwargs` and setting `vmin` and `vmax` accordingly, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also instructs the user to modify their code to use `vmin` and `vmax` instead of `clim`, which is not a change suggested by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff.",
