    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of making the session cookie age dynamic. It suggests subclassing `SessionBase` and overriding the `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods, which is in line with the git diff that also modifies these methods to use a new `get_session_cookie_age` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to implement the logic for determining the session cookie age dynamically and to replace the default `SessionStore` with the custom subclass in the Django settings.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the creation of the `get_session_cookie_age` method, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Instead, it suggests implementing the dynamic logic directly within the `get_expiry_age` and `get_expiry_date` methods. While this approach could work, it is not as clean as the git diff's solution, which abstracts the logic into a separate method that can be called from multiple places. This abstraction is beneficial for maintainability and reusability.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section with code snippets to check, which is not directly related to the solution but provides additional context for where the changes should be made in the codebase. This is helpful but not as critical as the solution itself.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that is close to the git diff's approach, but it misses the abstraction provided by the `get_session_cookie_age` method. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
