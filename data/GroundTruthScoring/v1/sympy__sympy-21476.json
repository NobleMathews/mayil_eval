    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the KeyError is due to a type mismatch between the keys in a dictionary and the type of the `sys` variable. It recommends ensuring that the keys used in the `RELATIONS` dictionary or any other relevant dictionary are consistent with the type of the `sys` variable and provides general advice on how to handle the type mismatch.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff. The git diff shows a comprehensive update to the `CoordSystem` class and related methods, including changes to how relations are stored and how transformations are calculated. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes or provide actionable guidance that would lead to the modifications shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies that there is a type mismatch issue, which is part of the problem described in the ISSUE. However, it lacks actionable content that would help resolve the issue in the way the git diff does. It does not mention the need to update the structure of the relations dictionary or the transformation methods, which are key elements of the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable guidance needed to align with the git diff and fully address the issue described.",
