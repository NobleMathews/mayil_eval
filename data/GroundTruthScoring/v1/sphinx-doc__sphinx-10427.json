    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `autodoc_preserve_defaults` setting is respected for class methods and verifying the handling of class methods in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. It also recommends ensuring that the `DefaultValue` class is used consistently for all method types, including class methods, and updating the logic if it is not. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not provide actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows specific changes to the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/preserve_defaults.py` file, including the handling of class methods and the assignment of the `__signature__` attribute. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or files, and instead, it provides general advice and points to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
