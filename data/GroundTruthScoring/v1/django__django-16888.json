    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general overview of steps that could be taken to investigate and potentially resolve the issue with the `DecimalField` in Django. However, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests checking and adjusting the `max_digits` attribute, validating queries, and reviewing recent changes, but it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as modifying the `get_db_prep_save` method and the use of `to_python` for value conversion. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer to review related code, but it does not provide a clear solution or directly address the traceback and the `decimal.InvalidOperation` error described in the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff.",
