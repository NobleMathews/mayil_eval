    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 4 indicates that the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `_eval_is_zero` method in the `Pow` class to handle cases where `self.exp.is_infinite` and `self.base` is not finite, which is aligned with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the additional conditions for when `self.base.is_finite` and `self.exp.is_finite` or when `self.exp.is_infinite` and `self.exp.is_extended_real`. \n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests modifying `_eval_is_extended_positive` to return `None` when `self.base` is zero and `self.exp` is not an extended positive number, which is not directly addressed in the git diff. The git diff does not include changes to `_eval_is_extended_positive`, so this part of the RESPONSE is not relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nThe RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to ensure that `zoo / n` returns `zoo` when `n` is finite, which is related to the issue description but does not reflect the changes in the git diff.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing the assumptions system to infer `finite=True` when `integer=True` or `real=True`, which is a broader suggestion that goes beyond the scope of the git diff and the specific issue described. While this suggestion is valuable, it does not provide actionable guidance in the context of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant suggestions but lacks the specificity and full alignment with the git diff necessary to resolve the issue completely.",
