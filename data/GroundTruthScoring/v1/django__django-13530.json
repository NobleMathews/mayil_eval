    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `KeyTransform` and `KeyTextTransform` classes are correctly handling SQL generation and modifying the `ArrayAgg` class to handle ordering with JSON field key transforms. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `as_sql` method in various classes, replacing it with `compiler.compile`, which is a more specific and direct solution to the problem. The RESPONSE does not mention this change or provide a similar solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests testing with a queryset that uses `ArrayAgg` with `KeyTransform`, which is relevant, but it does not provide actionable guidance on how to fix the issue. The RESPONSE also mentions checking for deprecation warnings or backward-incompatible changes in Django 3.1, which is not directly related to the git diff or the issue at hand. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant context but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
