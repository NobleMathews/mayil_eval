    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests updating the `lookup_allowed` method signature to include the `request` parameter and to replace the use of `self.list_filter` with `self.get_list_filter(request)`. Additionally, it advises ensuring that all calls to `lookup_allowed` pass the `request` object as an argument, which is in line with the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update any third-party code that overrides `lookup_allowed` to include the `request` parameter in the method signature. This is a relevant consideration given the context of the issue, which mentions that the method is overridden in the wild.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the addition of warnings for the deprecation of the current signature of `lookup_allowed`, which is included in the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is addressed effectively. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate.",
