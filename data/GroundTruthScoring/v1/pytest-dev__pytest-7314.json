    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to initialize the 'letter' variable with a default value at the beginning of the `pytest_report_teststatus` function, which aligns with the git diff's approach to ensure that 'letter' is always assigned before being referenced. However, the RESPONSE suggests using a placeholder value like 'X' or '?', which does not match the git diff's approach of setting 'letter' to 'F' and then changing it based on the test outcome. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the handling of aliases and the restructuring of the if-blocks to handle different test outcomes, which are significant parts of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant information about checking code snippets in various directories, which does not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in addressing all aspects of the issue.",
