    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the error message in `makemessages.py` to include more information, which aligns with the git diff's approach to improving the error message clarity. However, the RESPONSE also suggests creating the `locale` directory if it does not exist and updating the `LOCALE_PATHS` setting to include the directory where `manage.py` is located by default. These additional suggestions are not reflected in the git diff and are not necessary to resolve the issue as described. The git diff only modifies the error message to be more informative, without making changes to the directory structure or settings. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers some actionable advice but includes unnecessary steps that do not match the git diff.",
