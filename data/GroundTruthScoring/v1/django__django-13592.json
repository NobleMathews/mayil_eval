    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue described. The git diff shows changes to the Django model fields to ensure that the correct integer field types are used, including the addition of a SmallIntegerField class and modifications to the PositiveBigIntegerField and PositiveSmallIntegerField classes to inherit from the correct parent classes. The RESPONSE, however, suggests creating a custom intermediate model and does not address the changes made in the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a custom intermediate model for the ManyToManyField, which is a different approach from what is shown in the git diff. The git diff modifies the Django model field classes to ensure the correct field types are used, which would inherently fix the issue with the ManyToManyField not respecting the PositiveBigIntegerField. The RESPONSE does not mention or align with any of the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the SmallIntegerField class or the modifications to the inheritance of the PositiveBigIntegerField and PositiveSmallIntegerField classes. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff or the issue described.",
