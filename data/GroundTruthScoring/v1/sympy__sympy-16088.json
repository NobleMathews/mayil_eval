{
    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to use `_factor_sum_int` from `sympy/core/exprtools.py` for handling `Sum` and `Integral` objects, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a clear actionable solution that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows extensive changes across multiple files, including `exprtools.py`, `integrals.py`, `beam.py`, and `simplify.py`, which are not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to import `_factor_sum_int` and modify the `simplify` function is a high-level overview and lacks the detailed changes shown in the git diff, such as the addition of examples, notes, and the specific implementation of `_factor_sum_int`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the `beam.py` file or the adjustments to the import statements in the `simplify.py` file. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and detailed alignment with the git diff necessary to assist a developer in fixing the issue.",
