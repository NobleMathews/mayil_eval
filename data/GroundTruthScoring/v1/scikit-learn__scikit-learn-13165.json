    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by guiding the developer to the correct location in the code and suggesting a method to enforce monotonicity of bin edges. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `KBinsDiscretizer` class within the `fit` method and provides a code snippet to enforce monotonicity. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of removing bins with too small a width (i.e., <= 1e-8) and issuing a warning. Instead, it suggests enforcing monotonicity by iterating over the bin edges and applying a maximum function, which is a different solution to the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes links to the codebase, which could be helpful for locating the relevant sections of code, but these are not part of the git diff solution. The RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers a potential alternative solution, but it does not match the git diff's approach of handling bins with small widths, which is a key aspect of the issue. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
