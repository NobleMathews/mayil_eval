    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is partially relevant to the issue. It suggests modifying the `get_language_from_path` function to return the `LANGUAGE_CODE` when no language prefix is detected, which aligns with the git diff's approach of handling the language fallback. However, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff's changes, such as the removal of the `get_fallback_language` method and the adjustments to the `process_request` and `process_response` methods in `django/middleware/locale.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a hypothetical solution that is not entirely consistent with the git diff, as it does not address the changes made to `django/urls/resolvers.py` and `django/utils/translation/__init__.py`. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could potentially lead the developer to focus on areas that do not require modification. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat helpful but incomplete and only partially aligns with the git diff.",
