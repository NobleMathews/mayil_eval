    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py` file to ensure that the language selected by the user during the `sphinx-quickstart` process is properly set in the generated `conf.py` file. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `sphinx/cmd/quickstart.py` file or the `conf.py_t` template. Instead, the git diff shows changes to various other files within the Sphinx project to ensure that the language is set to 'en' by default and to handle language settings more consistently across the project. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader topic of setting the language in Sphinx configurations, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE receives a score of 1.",
