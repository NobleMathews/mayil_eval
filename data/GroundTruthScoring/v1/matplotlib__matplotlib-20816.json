    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests creating a context manager within the `CallbackRegistry` class to temporarily disable callbacks, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of a `blocked` context manager. The RESPONSE also correctly advises modifying the `process` method to check if callbacks are disabled, which is in line with the git diff's implementation that processes signals unless they are blocked. The RESPONSE's guidance to restore the state of callbacks after the context manager exits is also aligned with the git diff's use of a `finally` block to restore the original callbacks. However, the RESPONSE names the context manager `disabling_callbacks` instead of `blocked` as in the git diff, and it does not mention the ability to block a specific signal, which is a feature included in the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE's suggestion to create a context manager within the `CallbackRegistry` class is directly relevant to the git diff, which introduces a `blocked` context manager for the same purpose. The RESPONSE's advice to modify the `process` method aligns with the git diff's implementation that skips processing blocked signals. The RESPONSE's instruction to restore the original state of callbacks after the context manager exits is consistent with the git diff's use of a `finally` block to ensure callbacks are restored. The RESPONSE's omission of the ability to block a specific signal and the different naming of the context manager are minor discrepancies that do not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
