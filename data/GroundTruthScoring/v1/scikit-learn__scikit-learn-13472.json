    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the core issue with the `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` not correctly handling the `sample_weight` when the initial estimator is a pipeline. It suggests modifying the `fit` method to ensure that `sample_weight` is passed correctly. This aligns with the git diff's intent to handle the `sample_weight` parameter more effectively.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully capture the complexity of the solution presented in the git diff. The git diff includes additional error handling to differentiate between a TypeError due to an estimator not supporting sample weights and a ValueError due to input checking failure. The RESPONSE simplifies the solution by only suggesting to pass `sample_weight` as a named argument without addressing the error handling nuances.\n\nMoreover, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the solution and could potentially confuse the developer. The RESPONSE does not directly reference the correct file (`gradient_boosting.py`) and instead refers to `_gb.py`, which may not be the correct file in the context of the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a partial solution by addressing the passing of `sample_weight` but lacks the complete error handling strategy and precise file reference that the git diff provides. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and partially relevant.",
