    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a Sphinx extension to preserve the original constant names in function signatures, which is aligned with the goal of the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a concrete implementation or code that would directly solve the problem. Instead, it offers a high-level overview and a simplified example that does not reflect the complexity of the actual solution required, as seen in the git diff.\n\nThe git diff shows a detailed implementation involving the creation of a new Sphinx extension file `preserve_defaults.py` that includes a new configuration value, a function to update the default value information, and the setup function to connect everything. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific details or the approach taken in the git diff, such as using the `ast` module to parse and unparse the source code to preserve the default argument values.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it suggests creating an extension and connecting to an autodoc event, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the necessary code or detailed instructions that would enable the developer to implement the feature as done in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly helpful and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
