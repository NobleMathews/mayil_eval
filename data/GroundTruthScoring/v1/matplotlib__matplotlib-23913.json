    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the feature request to make the legend draggable at creation time. It correctly suggests modifying the __init__ method of the Legend class to accept a new keyword argument 'draggable' and setting its default value to 'False' for backward compatibility. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to call the 'set_draggable' method if 'draggable' is 'True'.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns closely with the git diff, which shows the addition of the 'draggable' keyword in the documentation and the __init__ method, as well as the call to 'self.set_draggable(state=draggable)'. The RESPONSE's suggested code changes are effectively the same as those in the git diff, with the only difference being the RESPONSE's inclusion of an if statement to check the value of 'draggable', which is not necessary since the 'set_draggable' method can be called directly with the 'draggable' value. This minor discrepancy does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the end result is the same.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional context by linking to relevant code snippets in the repository, which could be helpful for developers looking to understand the existing codebase and how the draggable functionality is currently implemented. This additional information is not required to fix the issue but could be valuable for a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a highly relevant solution that closely matches the git diff and would effectively resolve the issue described.",
