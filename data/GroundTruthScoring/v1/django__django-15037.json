    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_create_fk_sql` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py`, which is not related to the issue described. The issue is about the `inspectdb` command not handling foreign keys to specific fields correctly, and the git diff shows changes in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` to address this. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue. It also incorrectly identifies the file and method to be modified, leading the developer away from the correct location of the fix. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests implementing unit tests, which, while generally a good practice, does not directly address the issue at hand and is not part of the git diff provided.",
