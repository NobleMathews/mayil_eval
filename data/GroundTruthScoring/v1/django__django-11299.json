    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not directly address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to the incorrect SQL generation due to the use of fully qualified field names in a `CheckConstraint` when combining OR and AND clauses. The RESPONSE provides general advice on ensuring the `CheckConstraint` is defined correctly and suggests manually editing the migration file, which is not directly related to the actual problem or the solution provided in the GIT DIFF.\n\nThe GIT DIFF shows a specific change in the Django source code, where an additional parameter `simple_col` is passed to the `_add_q` method to ensure the correct handling of column references. The RESPONSE does not mention or suggest any changes to the Django source code or the internal handling of column references, which is the core of the solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some relevant general advice, such as testing the migration in a local development environment and ensuring that the database backend-specific behavior is accounted for, which is why it receives a score higher than 0. However, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue of incorrect SQL generation due to the use of fully qualified field names in the `CheckConstraint`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 2.",
