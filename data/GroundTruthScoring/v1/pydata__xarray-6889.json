    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of general troubleshooting steps that could be applied to issues with MultiIndex handling in xarray, such as using `align`, `reset_index`, `set_index`, and `reindex_like` functions, as well as updating to the latest versions of xarray and pandas. However, these suggestions do not directly address the specific issue described, which is related to the failure of alignment after using `xr.concat` on a dataset with a MultiIndex.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which shows a change in the `_dataset_concat` function where `dim_names` is replaced with `unlabeled_dims`. This indicates that the issue was resolved by changing the way dimensions are handled during the concatenation process, specifically by excluding unlabeled dimensions from the variables to merge.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to identify or suggest modifying the `_dataset_concat` function or any similar actionable change in the code. Instead, it provides a high-level overview of potential areas to investigate without specific instructions on how to implement a fix. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and lacks the precision and relevance needed to assist the developer in resolving the issue effectively.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
