    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of steps to implement optimization for `QuerySet.union().exists()` in Django, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff shows specific changes to the `as_sql` method in the `Subquery` and `Exists` classes, as well as modifications to the `exists` method in the `Query` class to handle the optimization for combined queries using `union`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests adding a new method `optimized_union_exists` and modifying the `exists` method in a way that is not supported by the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to modify the SQL compiler in a manner that is not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is related to the ISSUE, it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's solution, and the proposed changes are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
