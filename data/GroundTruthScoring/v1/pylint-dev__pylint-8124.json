    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests disabling the 'useless-import-alias' check globally or for specific lines using comments. This approach does not align with the git diff, which introduces a new configuration option 'allow-reexport-from-package' to handle the issue more precisely. The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described, which is to allow explicit reexports by alias from a package __init__.py without disabling the check entirely. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
