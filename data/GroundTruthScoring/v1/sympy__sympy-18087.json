    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking and modifying the `trigsimp` function and related simplification logic to handle complex numbers correctly. However, the git diff provided shows changes in the `exprtools.py` file, specifically in the handling of Rational numbers and the `as_expr` method. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as using `S.Zero` instead of `0` and modifying the way expressions are constructed with `Mul`. The RESPONSE also provides a list of code snippets to check, but these are not relevant to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or a viable alternative solution to the issue described.",
