    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 1 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff. It suggests general troubleshooting steps for logistic regression issues, such as checking the encoding of the target variable, verifying the use of the correct method to obtain probabilities, and adjusting model parameters. However, these suggestions do not address the specific issue of incorrect predictions with `multi_class='multinomial'` for binary outcomes in the LogisticRegression model.\n\nThe git diff shows that the actual solution involves modifying the `predict_proba` method to handle the binary outcome case correctly when `multi_class='multinomial'` is used. It includes a workaround for the 1D decision function case by creating a 2D decision array. The RESPONSE fails to mention or suggest any changes to the `predict_proba` method or any other code modifications that would resolve the issue.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests reviewing the code around a URL that is not provided in the issue description, which could lead the developer in the wrong direction. The RESPONSE does not provide any insights into the actual code changes needed, as shown in the git diff, and therefore does not offer real value in the context of the git diff.",
