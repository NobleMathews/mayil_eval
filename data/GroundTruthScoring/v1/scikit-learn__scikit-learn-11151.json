{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using `pytest.warns` to catch expected warnings and asserts them, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows changes in the `estimator_checks.py` and `testing.py` files, where it modifies the handling of warnings and exceptions. The RESPONSE does not align with these changes and instead suggests a different approach using pytest features and modifying the Travis CI configuration, which is not part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests reviewing and updating code to use current alternatives for deprecated functions, adjusting algorithm parameters, and ensuring numerical stability. These suggestions are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which focuses on the handling of warnings within the test suite.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some relevant advice regarding the handling of warnings in tests, which is related to the issue. However, it does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not provide the necessary actionable content to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
