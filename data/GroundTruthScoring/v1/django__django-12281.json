    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the error message for `admin.E130` to include information about the source of the duplicate action name, which aligns with the git diff's implementation of a more informative error message. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation of using a `collections.Counter` to identify duplicates, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `AdminSite` class has a method to check for duplicate action names and raises an error when duplicates are found. This is not directly addressed in the git diff, but it is a reasonable assumption given the context of the issue. The RESPONSE also recommends reviewing and possibly updating the documentation, which is a valuable suggestion but not directly related to the code changes in the git diff. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are helpful for locating relevant files but do not offer direct guidance on the changes needed. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff, but it is incomplete and does not fully capture the specific changes made in the git diff.",
