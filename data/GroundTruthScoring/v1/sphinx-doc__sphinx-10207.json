    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issues described in the ISSUE section nor does it align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates changes to the Sphinx documentation generator, including updates to the LaTeX builder, autodoc extension, and handling of typing and deprecation warnings. The RESPONSE, however, provides a generic JavaScript solution for adding a keyboard shortcut to focus on a search box, which is unrelated to the changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE discusses modifying the Sphinx extensions to handle instance attributes and abbreviate long dictionaries, which are also not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issues presented.",
