    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating or identifying a migration file with a `RenameModel` operation and updating `ForeignKey` references and `AlterField` operations in subsequent migration files. While this approach is related to the issue of renaming models, it does not address the core problem of Django not detecting case changes in model names, which is the focus of the issue. The git diff provided shows changes in the Django source code to handle case sensitivity in model names by using `name_lower` and `label_lower` properties. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Django source code or the specific changes shown in the git diff, which are necessary to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it deals with model renaming but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
