    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue by suggesting modifications to the `degrees_to_dms` function and the `signed_dms` property in the `Angle` class. The RESPONSE's suggestion to handle the case when `d` is zero and the angle is negative in the `degrees_to_dms` function is actionable and relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of deprecating the `dms_to_degrees` and `hms_to_hours` functions and modifying the `__new__` method of the `Angle` class to handle tuple inputs directly. Instead, the RESPONSE focuses on modifying existing functions without deprecation, which is a different approach from the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for the developer, but it does not directly address the deprecation and alternative creation methods for angles as suggested by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is partially relevant and offers actionable advice but does not fully match the git diff's approach.",
