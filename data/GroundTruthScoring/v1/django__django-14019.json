    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to standardize the `__repr__` methods across different classes, which is relevant to the issue of making `__repr__` methods consistent. However, the RESPONSE suggests a new implementation using a `standard_repr` function, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `__repr__` methods in the `Index`, `UniqueConstraint`, `ExclusionConstraint`, and `CheckConstraint` classes, without introducing a new shared function. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying each `__repr__` method individually and ensuring the output format is consistent across classes. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the exact changes to the `__repr__` methods as shown in the git diff, such as the use of `repr()` for certain attributes and the removal of unnecessary quotes around string representations. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the need for consistency, it does not provide the specific actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach.",
