    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to receive a score above 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `conf.py` file with various settings related to `autodoc` and pinning the Sphinx version, which are general troubleshooting steps for Sphinx documentation issues. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix involves modifying the `visit_Subscript` and `visit_Tuple` methods in the `sphinx/pycode/ast.py` file to correctly handle tuple default arguments in docstrings. The RESPONSE does not address the specific code changes needed and instead provides general advice and links to unrelated code snippets. Therefore, it does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
