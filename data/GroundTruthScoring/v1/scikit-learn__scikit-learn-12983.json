    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `fit` method to check if the `init` estimator supports sample weights and to reshape the output of the `init` estimator's `predict` method. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes involve deprecating old estimators and loss functions, moving loss functions to a new module, and updating import statements to reflect these changes. The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead provides an alternative solution that is not supported by the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding test cases, which is not reflected in the git diff either. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue as described.",
