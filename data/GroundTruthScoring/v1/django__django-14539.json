    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and be relevant given the issue and the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct function, `urlize`, and the correct file, `django/utils/html.py`, where the issue is located. It correctly suggests that the `trim_punctuation` method needs to be modified and that HTML escaped strings should not be included in the URL during processing. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide specific, actionable changes that align with the git diff. Instead, it suggests checking the `handle_word` method and updating regular expressions, which are not part of the solution in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to the `Urlizer` class, which does not exist in the provided git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the correct approach of adjusting the slicing of the `middle` variable and the calculation of `trail` as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore, it receives a low score.",
