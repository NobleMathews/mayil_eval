    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable steps to add support for `item_comments` in the syndication framework, which is the core issue described. It suggests modifying the `add_item` method in the `SyndicationFeed` class and the `add_item_elements` method in the `Rss201rev2Feed` class, which is a reasonable approach to the problem. However, the git diff provided as the solution only modifies the `get_feed` method in `views.py` to include the `comments` attribute without altering the `SyndicationFeed` or `Rss201rev2Feed` classes. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of directly adding the `comments` attribute in the `get_feed` method. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is relevant and provides actionable advice, it does not align closely with the git diff's solution and is more complex than necessary. This warrants a score within the 4-6 range, and a score of 4 is appropriate as the RESPONSE does not directly address the git diff's simpler solution.",
