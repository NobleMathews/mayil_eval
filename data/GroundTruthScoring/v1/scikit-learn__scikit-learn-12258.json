    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests adding a check to zero out the diagonal of the precomputed distance matrix within the `silhouette_samples` function, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the check, which is actionable and directly addresses the issue. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `np.fill_diagonal(X, 0)` to zero out the diagonal, which is different from the git diff's approach of raising an error if non-zero diagonal elements are found. While the RESPONSE's solution is a valid alternative and would prevent incorrect silhouette scores, it does not match the git diff's method of handling the issue, which is to raise an error and inform the user. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a highly relevant and actionable solution that achieves a similar result to the git diff but through a different approach.",
