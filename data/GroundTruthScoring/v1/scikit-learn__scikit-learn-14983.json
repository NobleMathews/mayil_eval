    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests overriding the `__repr__` method in both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes to return the expected string representation. This approach is different from the git diff, which modifies the `_build_repr` function to correctly handle `None` values and potentially other `cvargs` that were not being represented. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying issue that the `_build_repr` function may not be handling all necessary attributes, especially those passed via `cvargs`. Instead, it provides a hardcoded `__repr__` method, which may not be flexible or maintainable if new parameters are added to the classes in the future. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to fix the `__repr__` output, but it does not align with the git diff's approach to make the representation dynamic and maintainable. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
