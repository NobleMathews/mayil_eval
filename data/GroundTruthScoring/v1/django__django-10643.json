    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests customizing the `get_search_results` method in the `ModelAdmin` to handle UUID fields differently when the database backend is Oracle. This approach is a workaround that could potentially solve the issue but does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `lookups.py` file to add a mixin and several new lookup classes that handle the stripping of hyphens from UUIDs when the database backend does not have a native UUID datatype. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `lookups.py` file or creating new lookup classes, which are key elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the problem of searching for UUIDs with or without dashes in the admin search field. However, it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach of registering new lookups for the `UUIDField`. The RESPONSE's alternative solution is not as robust as the git diff's solution, which would provide a more integrated and reusable fix within the Django framework. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it offers a workaround that could be used but does not closely match the git diff's solution or provide a similarly effective alternative.",
