    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of ZeroDivisionError in the _sparse_fit method for SVM with empty support_vectors_. It suggests checking if n_SV or n_class is zero to avoid division by zero and creating an empty csr_matrix with the appropriate shape if that is the case. This aligns with the git diff, which also introduces a condition to handle the case when n_SV is zero by creating an empty csr_matrix. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the file and method where the change should be made and provides a code snippet that would prevent the ZeroDivisionError.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes an additional check for n_class being zero, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff only checks for n_SV being zero. While this additional check does not conflict with the git diff, it is not necessary based on the issue description, which only mentions the problem occurring when support_vectors_ is empty. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using floor division (//) for dual_coef_indices.size // n_class, which is not present in the git diff and is not necessary since the division is already being avoided by the condition check.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a highly relevant solution that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes an unnecessary check and a suggestion for floor division that are not part of the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 7 as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but includes additional elements not present in the git diff.",
