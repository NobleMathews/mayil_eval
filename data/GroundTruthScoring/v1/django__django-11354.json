    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is aligned with the git diff or provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `RawSQL` snippet to include the correct table name for the `title` field, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `resolve_expression` method to ensure that parent model fields used in raw SQL are resolved correctly, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the `QuerySet.count()` method failing with raw SQL annotations on inherited model fields. Instead, it focuses on the syntax of the `RawSQL` annotation, which is not the root cause of the issue. The RESPONSE does provide a link to the relevant code in the Django repository, but the advice given does not help to resolve the issue as described or as fixed in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
