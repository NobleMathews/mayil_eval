{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `read_manifest` method to catch `PermissionError` and raise a more informative error message, which is in line with the issue's request for more granular error handling. The provided code snippet adds an except block for `PermissionError` and raises a detailed error message, which is a viable alternative to the git diff's approach of catching `FileNotFoundError` instead of `OSError`. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, but it addresses the underlying issue of providing better error handling and informative messages when permission issues occur, which is the core problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant, providing a clear solution that would help developers understand and fix the permission-related problem. However, it does not score a perfect 10 because it does not exactly match the git diff's approach of changing the caught exception type, but it still effectively resolves the issue at hand.",
