    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, considering the effectiveness and relevance of the suggested solution.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `KeyboardTransform` class in the `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py` file, which is aligned with the git diff that introduces a new `KeyboardTransform` class in the same file. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to split the keystrokes and wrap them individually in `<kbd>` tags, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to handling the :kbd: role transformation.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention creating a new file `transforms.py` as shown in the git diff, nor does it suggest setting up the extension in the `__init__.py` file, which is a crucial step in the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a pseudo-code implementation that does not match the actual implementation in the git diff. The git diff includes a regular expression pattern to split the keystrokes and a more complex logic for handling the transformation, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it lacks the complete details and specific implementation steps present in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant.",
