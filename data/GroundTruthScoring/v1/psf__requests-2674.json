    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the goal of the `requests` library to abstract away `urllib3` exceptions and provide its own set of exceptions. It also correctly suggests that `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from `urllib3` should be caught and re-raised as `requests` exceptions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically addresses the `ClosedPoolError` from `urllib3` and re-raises it as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The RESPONSE instead discusses `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`, which are not mentioned in the git diff. While the RESPONSE provides a general approach to handling exceptions in the `requests` library, it does not provide actionable advice for the specific issue of `ClosedPoolError` that the git diff addresses. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in the context of the git diff.",
