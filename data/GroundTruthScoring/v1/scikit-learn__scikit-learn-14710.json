    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue of the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` not working with string targets when early stopping is turned on. It suggests checking if the targets are strings and converting them to integers using the `self.classes_` attribute, which is aligned with the git diff's approach of using `self.classes_` to convert `y_small_train` and `y_val` to the correct format.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests using `np.searchsorted(self.classes_, y_small_train)` and `np.searchsorted(self.classes_, y_val)` for the conversion, which is a valid alternative to the git diff's use of `self.classes_[y_small_train.astype(int)]` and `self.classes_[y_val.astype(int)]`. Both methods achieve the same result of converting string labels to integer labels.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the exact condition `is_classifier(self)` used in the git diff to determine when to perform the conversion. Instead, it checks the dtype of `y_small_train` and `y_val` directly. While this is a reasonable approach, it is not a direct match to the git diff's condition. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes an unnecessary parameter `sample_weight_small_train` and `sample_weight_val` in the method signature, which are not part of the issue or the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a clear solution that is effective and closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not a perfect match due to the differences in the condition used for conversion and the inclusion of unnecessary parameters.",
