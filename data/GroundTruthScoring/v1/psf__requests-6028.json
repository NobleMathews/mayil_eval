{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several general troubleshooting steps for proxy authentication issues, such as verifying the structure of the `proxies` dictionary, using the `HTTPProxyAuth` class, and checking the `trust_env` parameter. It also suggests using a session object to explicitly set the proxies, which is not directly related to the git diff but could be a valid approach to solving proxy issues in some cases.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not address the specific change made in the git diff, which involves appending the authentication credentials to the `netloc` if they are present. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `prepend_scheme_if_needed` function or any related code changes. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers some general advice that could be helpful, it does not align closely with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that could be relevant to the issue, but these do not directly relate to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's solution to the issue, which involves handling the authentication credentials in the URL netloc.",
