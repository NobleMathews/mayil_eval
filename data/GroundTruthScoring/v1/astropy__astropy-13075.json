    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing the feature of exporting a `Cosmology` object to an HTML table with MathJax formatting, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a complete implementation of the HTML I/O functionality, including the registration of the reader, writer, and identifier for the HTML format, as well as the specific functions `read_html_table` and `write_html_table`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a high-level overview and does not provide the specific code changes that are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Parameter` class to include a `mathjax_format` attribute, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes unnecessary steps such as adding MathJax scripts to the HTML file, which is already handled in the git diff's implementation of `write_html_table`. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide the specific implementation details necessary to resolve the ISSUE.",
