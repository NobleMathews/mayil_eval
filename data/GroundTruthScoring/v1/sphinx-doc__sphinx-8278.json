    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking for a Sphinx extension or configuration option, creating a custom Sphinx extension, and modifying the `format_default_values` method or similar functions. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual solution involves modifying the `ast.py` and `inspect.py` files within the Sphinx codebase to ensure that numeric literals are unparsed correctly, preserving their original format (hexadecimal, in this case). The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the internal Sphinx code to address the issue. Instead, it suggests a different and unrelated approach that does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help the developer in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
