    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general explanation of why subquery expressions are included in the `GROUP BY` clause and offers some generic advice on how to control the `GROUP BY` clause in Django queries. However, it does not align with the git diff provided, which shows modifications to the Django ORM's internal methods to add an optional `alias` parameter to the `get_group_by_cols` method across various classes. The RESPONSE does not suggest modifying the Django ORM internals or provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same effect as the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests using `annotate()` and `values()` to control the `GROUP BY` clause, which is a valid approach in some cases but does not address the specific issue of the ORM automatically including subquery expressions in the `GROUP BY` clause when chaining annotations. The RESPONSE also mentions the possibility of using raw SQL or `.extra()`, which is not reflected in the git diff and does not provide a direct solution to the problem.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue of modifying the ORM's behavior regarding subquery expressions in the `GROUP BY` clause. Therefore, it receives a low score for its relevance and utility in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
