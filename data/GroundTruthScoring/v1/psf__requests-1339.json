    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the __setitem__ method in the CaseInsensitiveDict class to handle case-insensitive key comparison and updating values. This aligns with the git diff's approach to modifying the CaseInsensitiveDict to address case-insensitivity issues. However, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff's implementation, which involves a more comprehensive overhaul of the CaseInsensitiveDict class, including inheriting from collections.MutableMapping and implementing additional methods like __getitem__, __delitem__, __iter__, __len__, lower_items, __eq__, copy, and __repr__. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the copy method to use OrderedDict is not present in the git diff, and the git diff does not include changes to the __setitem__ method as described in the RESPONSE. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the need to handle case-insensitive key storage and updates, it does not match the git diff's complete solution and introduces elements not found in the diff. As such, it is partially relevant and actionable but incomplete in the context of the git diff.",
