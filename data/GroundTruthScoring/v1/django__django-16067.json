    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `DecimalValidator`'s `__call__` method and the `DecimalField`'s `to_python` method to normalize the value before performing validation checks. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also modifies the `DecimalValidator`'s `__call__` method, but it does not match the specific implementation in the git diff. The git diff adds a condition to handle the case where the digit tuple is not zero before adding the exponent to the digits, whereas the RESPONSE suggests normalizing the value in all cases. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `to_python` method is not reflected in the git diff, which indicates that the issue can be resolved within the `DecimalValidator` alone. The RESPONSE does provide actionable advice and includes a test case to verify the fix, which is valuable. However, it does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue and introduces changes to a method that the git diff does not alter. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and receives a score of 4.",
