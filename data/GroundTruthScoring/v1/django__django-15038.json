    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable steps that closely align with the git diff. It correctly suggests verifying the existence of the migration file before writing the new squashed migration file and raising a CommandError if the file already exists, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets that are relevant to the issue and the git diff, enhancing the developer's understanding of where the changes should be made.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions that are not present in the git diff, such as modifying the `squashmigrations` command to include a `replaces` attribute and handling circular dependencies. While these suggestions are relevant to the broader context of the issue, they are not part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not perfectly align with the git diff but still provides highly relevant and actionable guidance that would significantly aid the developer in resolving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the import of the `os` module, which is a minor omission but does not detract significantly from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's focus on preventing overwriting of existing migration files and raising a CommandError is directly in line with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
