    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests avoiding the use of `pyplot.clf()` within the `onchanged` callback and instead recommends clearing specific axes or updating the data of existing artists. It also advises using `fig.canvas.draw_idle()` to update the figure. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of widget input being blocked, they do not align with the git diff provided, which specifically adds a `self.canvas.release_mouse(ax)` call in the `matplotlib/figure.py` file to address the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention or suggest anything related to releasing the mouse capture from the axes, which is the core change in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides general advice on handling widget updates and redrawing in Matplotlib, which is only tangentially related to the specific problem of input blocking described in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but these do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the specific problem at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
