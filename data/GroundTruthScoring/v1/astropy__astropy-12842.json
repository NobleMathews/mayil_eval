    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding 'datetime64' and 'timedelta64' to the ECSV_DATATYPES tuple in `astropy/io/ascii/ecsv.py` and ensuring that the `EcsvHeader` class can handle these data types appropriately. While this suggestion is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE, which involves reading ECSV files with a 'datetime64' column, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `core.py` file, specifically modifications to the `TimeInfo` and `TimeDeltaInfo` classes, and does not indicate any changes to the `ECSV_DATATYPES` or the `EcsvHeader` class. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the error message mentioned in the ISSUE, but it fails to provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's changes. As such, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, indicating that it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
