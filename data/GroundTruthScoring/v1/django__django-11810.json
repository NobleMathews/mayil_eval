    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `self._chain()` is correctly implemented to return a new QuerySet instance and to verify that `self._chain()` uses `self._clone()` to create a new QuerySet instance. It also suggests replacing `obj = self._chain()` with `obj = self._clone()` in the `select_related` and `prefetch_related` methods if necessary. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix involved importing the `copy` module and using `copy.deepcopy` to ensure that the `select_related` attribute of the QuerySet is deeply copied when cloning the QuerySet. The RESPONSE does not mention the need for a deep copy or the use of the `copy` module, which is a critical part of the fix according to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative to the actual fix needed. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of cloning and mutation of the QuerySet, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not offer a complete solution to the problem.",
