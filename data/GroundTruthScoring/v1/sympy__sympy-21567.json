    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the implementation of the `_eval_expand_trig` method for both `csch` and `sech` classes, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows a more complex implementation that handles not only the addition of angles but also the multiplication of an angle by an integer coefficient. The RESPONSE's solution is simpler and does not cover these cases. While the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the need for an expansion method, it does not provide a complete solution that matches the git diff's complexity and thoroughness. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff.",
