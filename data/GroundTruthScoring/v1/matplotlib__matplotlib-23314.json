    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the issue as being within the `Axes3D` class in the `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d` module and suggests modifying the `draw` method to check the visibility of the `Axes3D` object before proceeding with the drawing logic. This is exactly what the git diff does, adding a visibility check at the beginning of the `draw` method. The RESPONSE also correctly advises that if the object is not visible, the method should return immediately, which is in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE further suggests ensuring that the `set_visible` method correctly sets the visibility attribute, which is a valid point, although it is not directly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that matches the git diff's solution. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions for checking code snippets and running tests, which, while valuable, are not part of the git diff. However, these suggestions do not detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.",
