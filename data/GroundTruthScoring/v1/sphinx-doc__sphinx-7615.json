    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff provided, which represents the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the `visit_literal_block` method in `sphinx/writers/latex.py` or `sphinx/writers/html5.py` and modifying the regular expression or string handling logic to comply with the RST specification for backslash rendering. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the `get_tokens` method in `sphinx/transforms/__init__.py` to handle smart quotes and backslashes differently based on the version of docutils. The RESPONSE does not mention the `get_tokens` method or the handling of smart quotes, which are key elements of the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the issue of backslash rendering, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also suggests adding test cases, which is a good practice but is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is not entirely unhelpful, as it does encourage looking into the rendering process, but it fails to identify the correct location and nature of the fix.",
