{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of trailing whitespace in the `DatasetGroupBy` text representation. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `__str__` or `__repr__` method within the `DatasetGroupBy` class to remove the trailing whitespace. The RESPONSE also provides a general example of how the code might look before and after the change, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests looking for either `__str__` or `__repr__` method, while the git diff specifically modifies the `__repr__` method. However, this does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the guidance provided would lead to the same outcome as the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the code snippet that might contain the relevant method, which is helpful, although not necessary for the fix. The RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 because it includes additional guidance about checking code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff, but this information is not incorrect or misleading. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and would assist the developer in fixing the issue effectively.",
