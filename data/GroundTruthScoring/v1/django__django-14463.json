    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general overview of how to implement comments for tables and columns in Django models, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, it does not align closely with the GIT DIFF, which contains specific changes to various Django files to support comments in the database schema.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests modifying the Django model fields to accept new arguments for comments and updating the ORM and migration framework accordingly. It also mentions updating the `inspectdb` command and documentation. While these suggestions are on the right track, they are not specific enough and do not provide actionable code changes or detailed guidance that matches the GIT DIFF.\n\nThe GIT DIFF shows detailed modifications to the Django core files, including the addition of new features flags in the database backends, updates to the schema editor, and changes to the introspection modules for different databases. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes or provide alternative solutions that would achieve the same result.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but lacks the actionable content and detailed alignment with the GIT DIFF necessary to score higher.",
