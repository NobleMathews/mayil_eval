    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue described. It suggests checking the initialization of the `mask` attribute, ensuring that `handle_mask` is correctly handling `None` masks, and modifying the `_arithmetic` method to handle `None` masks appropriately. These suggestions are in line with the git diff, which modifies the `_arithmetic_mask` method to handle cases where one operand's mask is `None`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the issue is with the mask handling logic in the arithmetic operations and provides a code snippet that could potentially resolve the issue, which is similar to the approach taken in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests a more general approach to handling `None` masks with any callable, not just `np.bitwise_or`, and it includes additional steps such as updating the `mask.setter` and adding unit tests, which are not part of the git diff. These additional steps are not necessary to fix the issue but are good practices. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not a perfect match due to the additional suggestions.",
