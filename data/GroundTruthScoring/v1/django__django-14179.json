    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_origin_verified` method in `CsrfViewMiddleware` to handle the `DisallowedHost` exception by returning `False` when the exception is caught. This is in line with the git diff, which also introduces a try-except block to handle the `DisallowedHost` exception. The RESPONSE's solution is slightly different from the git diff in that it returns `False` immediately upon catching the exception, while the git diff continues to check `request_origin` against `self.allowed_origins_exact` and other conditions before returning. However, this difference does not significantly deviate from the intent of the git diff, which is to handle the `DisallowedHost` exception appropriately. The RESPONSE also provides relevant code snippets for context, which is helpful for the developer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and actionable, closely matching the git diff's approach to the issue.",
