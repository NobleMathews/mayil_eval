{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the handling of keyword arguments in custom template tags and suggests modifying the `parse_bits` function in `django/template/library.py`. The RESPONSE also correctly points out the need to raise the correct error message when a keyword argument is provided multiple times, which is in line with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a detailed solution that includes code changes to the `parse_bits` function, which are similar to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly suggests checking if the parameter is not in `params` and not in `kwonly` and if `varkw` is None, then raise a `TemplateSyntaxError`. This is aligned with the git diff, which changes the condition to check against `kwonly` instead of `unhandled_kwargs`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional error handling for when a keyword argument is provided multiple times, which is not part of the git diff. While this is a valuable addition and relevant to the issue, it is not reflected in the git diff provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not perfectly align with the git diff but still offers a viable and effective solution to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for further checking, which is helpful but not directly related to the git diff's changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional elements not present in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
