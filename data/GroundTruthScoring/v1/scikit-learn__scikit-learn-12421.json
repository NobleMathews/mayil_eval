    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and offers actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the problem with the `core_distances_` attribute and suggests checking and updating the `_compute_core_distances_` function to ensure that points that will never be core are assigned `np.inf`. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that `max_eps` is set correctly and that the core distances are properly returned and used in the `fit` method. These suggestions are relevant and would help in resolving the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff in several aspects:\n\n1. It mentions the need to ensure that `max_eps` is set to `np.inf` or a sufficiently large value, which is consistent with the git diff where `self.core_distances_[self.core_distances_ > self.max_eps] = np.inf` is added to the `fit` method.\n\n2. It suggests checking the `_compute_core_distances_` function, which is indeed modified in the git diff to handle the assignment of `np.inf` to points that will never be core.\n\n3. The RESPONSE advises adding a check after the core distances are computed, which is similar to the git diff's approach of modifying the core distance computation.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of the heap management comment, the addition of comments explaining the differences from the original OPTICS, and the restructuring of the `_calculate_optics_order` function. While these changes are not directly related to the core issue of `core_distances_`, they are part of the overall solution in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which are not part of the git diff but could be helpful for a developer looking to understand the context of the changes needed.",
