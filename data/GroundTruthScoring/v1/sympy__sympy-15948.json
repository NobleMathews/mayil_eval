    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance or solutions that align with the git diff. It vaguely outlines the issue and suggests a general approach without specific instructions or code changes. The git diff, however, contains specific modifications to multiple files within the SymPy library, addressing the issue with matrix expressions and substitutions. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these changes or provide a similar alternative solution. Therefore, it does not offer any value in assisting a developer to fix the issue described.",
