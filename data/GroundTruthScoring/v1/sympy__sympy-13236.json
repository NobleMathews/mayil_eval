    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests checking the implementation of the `equals` method and the `_eval_simplify` method, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the assumptions system, the expression tools, the modulo operation, and the evaluation of composite numbers, prime numbers, and even numbers in various classes. The RESPONSE fails to address these specific changes and instead provides a general overview of potential areas to investigate without any direct reference to the modifications shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does mention the modulo operation in relation to the `_facmod` method, but this is not the focus of the git diff, and the RESPONSE does not provide any specific guidance on how to address the issue with the factorial function not simplifying correctly when taking the modulus with n or k. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to the `equals` method as part of the `Symbol` class, which is not relevant to the issue or the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the factorial function and the modulo operation, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
