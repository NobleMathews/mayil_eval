    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to modify the `JSONReporter` class to include the score in the JSON output when the `--score=y` option is used. It suggests updating the `display_messages` method and the `serialize_stats` method to correctly calculate and format the score. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `include_score` attribute should be set based on the `--score=y` command-line argument.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in several ways. The git diff introduces a new `JSON2Reporter` class rather than modifying the existing `JSONReporter`. The RESPONSE does not mention the new `JSON2Reporter` class or the `CONFIDENCE_MAP` which is part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `serialize_stats` method, but the git diff shows a more comprehensive change, including the introduction of a new `JSONMessage` TypedDict and the handling of absolute paths and confidence levels.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of including the score in the JSON output, but it does not match the git diff's approach of creating a new reporter class and does not account for all the changes made in the git diff.",
