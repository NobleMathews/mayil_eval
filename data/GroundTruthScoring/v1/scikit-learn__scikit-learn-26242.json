    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff in several aspects. It correctly suggests updating the `_parameter_constraints` dictionary in the `BaseWeightBoosting` class to allow `None` as a valid value for `base_estimator`, which is reflected in the git diff. It also correctly identifies the need to handle the `base_estimator=None` case without raising an `InvalidParameterError`, which is addressed in the git diff by modifying the `_validate_estimator` method. The RESPONSE further suggests deprecating the `base_estimator` parameter in favor of the `estimator` parameter, which is consistent with the git diff's warning message about the deprecation. However, the RESPONSE suggests setting the `estimator_` attribute to a default `DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)` when `base_estimator` is `None`, which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff sets the `estimator_` to `default` without specifying what the default is. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests removing checks that raise `InvalidParameterError` when `base_estimator` is `None`, which is not explicitly shown in the git diff, but the changes made in the git diff would prevent such an error from being raised. Lastly, the RESPONSE advises updating the `fit` method to handle `base_estimator=None`, which is not directly addressed in the git diff, but the changes made would affect the behavior of the `fit` method indirectly. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes some additional suggestions not present in the git diff.",
