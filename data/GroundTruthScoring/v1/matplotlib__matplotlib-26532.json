    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the location of the issue within the `Poly3DCollection.__init__` method in the `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py` file. It provides clear instructions to replace the incorrect `edgecolors in None` with the correct `edgecolors is None`, which is exactly what the git diff shows as the necessary change. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that the `shade` parameter is correctly used and that it does not cause a `TypeError`, which is in line with the git diff's intent to fix the TypeError caused by the typo. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the code snippet where the typo is present, which is helpful for locating the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance that directly aligns with the git diff.",
