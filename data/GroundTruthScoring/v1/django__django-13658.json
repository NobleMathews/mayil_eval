{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that `self.prog_name` is correctly initialized and provides a code snippet to handle cases where `sys.argv[0]` might be `None`. While this is a good practice, it does not directly address the issue described, which is about passing the already-computed `prog` argument to `CommandParser`. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `CommandParser` instantiation to use `self.prog_name`, which is the core of the issue and the main change in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing all usages of `self.argv[0]` and `sys.argv[0]` throughout the codebase, which is beyond the scope of the specific issue and the git diff provided. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it touches on the initialization of `self.prog_name`, but it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
