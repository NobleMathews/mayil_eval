    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the call to `all_pix2world` to pass a 2D array with the correct dimensions, which is a workaround rather than a direct fix to the code. While this advice could potentially avoid the error, it does not address the underlying issue in the code that causes the `IndexError` when a scalar is passed. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the condition in the `_return_single_array` function to handle the case when `xy.shape` is an empty tuple, which represents a scalar input. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, as it does not suggest changing the code to handle scalar inputs correctly. Instead, it advises the user to change their input format, which is only a temporary solution and does not contribute to fixing the bug in the software repository. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the nature of the error but lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's solution.",
