    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to replace ad-hoc checks for `sample_weight` with the `_check_sample_weight` function in the specified classes' `fit` or `partial_fit` methods. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to import `_check_sample_weight` from `sklearn.utils.validation` if it's not already imported, which is in line with the git diff that adds the import statement for `_check_sample_weight`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests removing redundant imports of `check_consistent_length` and `check_array` if they were only used for validating `sample_weight`, which is a logical step following the refactoring but is not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, but it provides a valid and effective alternative approach to achieve the same result, which is to use `_check_sample_weight` consistently across the codebase. The RESPONSE also includes relevant code snippets and notes on potential updates to tests, which is valuable for ensuring consistency and correctness after the changes. The RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it does not include the specific change to the `fit` method shown in the git diff, which replaces the ad-hoc checks with a single call to `_check_sample_weight(sample_weight, X, DOUBLE)`. However, the RESPONSE's guidance is highly relevant and would effectively lead a developer to make the necessary changes to resolve the issue.",
