    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `desc()` method from the `UniqueConstraint` definition in the `Foo` model's `Meta` class, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the code has been modified to handle ordered expressions by ignoring the ordering when validating the `UniqueConstraint`. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes made in the git diff and instead suggests a workaround that would change the intended behavior of the `UniqueConstraint` by removing the ordering altogether. This does not fix the issue but rather avoids it, which is not a solution to the problem described in the ISSUE. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for further investigation, but these do not offer direct actionable steps to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
