    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `set_output` method in the `ColumnTransformer` class to handle the `remainder` transformer when it is an estimator, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests calling `_safe_set_output` on the `remainder` transformer if it is not \"passthrough\" or \"drop\", which matches the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is very similar to the git diff, with the addition of a check for the existence of the `remainder` attribute using `hasattr(self, 'remainder')`. This is a minor difference and does not detract from the effectiveness of the solution. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that the `remainder` attribute is correctly initialized and adding tests to verify the fix, which are good practices but not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It offers a clear solution that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes additional suggestions not present in the git diff, such as ensuring the correct initialization of the `remainder` attribute and adding tests, which, while valuable, are not part of the git diff's solution.",
