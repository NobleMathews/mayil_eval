    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying methods such as `_cast_to_float64`, `sag_solver`, and checking for unnecessary copies and dtype conversions, which are not mentioned or implied in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the `ridge_regression` and `_ridge_regression` functions, adding a new function `_get_valid_accept_sparse`, and modifying the handling of input checks and sparse matrix formats. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes or provide guidance related to them.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes several points that are not relevant to the issue at hand, such as removing code related to the `SVM` module and classes like `_BaseRidgeCV`, `_RidgeGCV`, `_BaseRidge`, and `RidgeClassifierCV`, which are not part of the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE also references checking commit history and related PRs or issues, which is not actionable in terms of code changes required to fix the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable insight or meaningful information that would assist a developer in fixing the issue based on the git diff provided.",
