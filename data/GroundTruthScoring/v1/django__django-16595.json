    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`, which aligns with the git diff's approach to include `AlterField` in the condition. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to check if `is_same_field_operation` returns `True` before merging the operations, which is consistent with the git diff's logic.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation. The git diff modifies the condition to include both `AlterField` and `RemoveField` in a single `isinstance` check, while the RESPONSE only mentions `AlterField`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests implementing merging logic, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff simply returns the `operation` if the conditions are met, without additional merging logic.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a placeholder for merging logic and a comment to implement the actual merging based on requirements, which is not directly supported by the git diff. The git diff does not provide any merging logic and assumes that returning the operation is sufficient.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue, but it does not perfectly align with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it is scored a 7.",
