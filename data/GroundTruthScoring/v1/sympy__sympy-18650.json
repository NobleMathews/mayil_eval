    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to simplification logic when raising `sqrt(8)` to the power of `Rational(2, 3)` and correctly states that the expected result should be `2`. However, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the `_eval_power` method in the `Rational` class and other related simplification logic, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the changes were made in the `sympy/core/power.py` file, specifically adding a condition to handle cases where the exponent is a `Rational` and the base is a number raised to a `Rational` power. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or file but instead points to a broader review of the `Rational` class and simplification logic. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be related to the issue but does not offer actionable guidance on the specific changes needed to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
