    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff by suggesting to ensure that the parent's primary key (PK) is properly assigned to the child before saving the child object. This is in line with the git diff's addition of code to set the child's FK field to the parent's PK if it is not None. However, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff as it suggests modifying the `Child` model's `save` method, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff modifies the `save` method in `base.py` and adds a condition in `related.py` to clear the remote field object when the data is None. The RESPONSE does not mention the latter part, which is a significant aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could potentially lead to confusion. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a somewhat relevant but incomplete solution to the issue.",
