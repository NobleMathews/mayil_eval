    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the feature of contributing additional global variables for `skipif`/`xfail` in pytest, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff shows that a new hook function `pytest_markeval_namespace` is being added to the `hookspec.py` file, and modifications are made to the `skipping.py` file to integrate the new hook and update the globals dictionary used for evaluating conditions. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying the pytest configuration and decorators, and using a `global_variable` marker, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly mention the need for documentation and tests, which is in line with the ISSUE, but it fails to provide specific, actionable steps that match the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff or the ISSUE. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
