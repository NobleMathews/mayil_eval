    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are highly relevant to the issue of UnicodeDecodeError when loading debug templates. It suggests checking for non-UTF-8 characters, ensuring the template is saved with UTF-8 encoding, and opening the file with the correct encoding specified, which directly aligns with the git diff's approach of specifying the encoding as 'utf-8' when opening the files. Additionally, the RESPONSE offers an alternative solution involving error handling in the `_get_lines_from_file` function, which is not present in the git diff but could be a valid approach to handling encoding issues. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the Django release notes or the template's change history, which is a reasonable step for understanding the context of the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes additional suggestions not present in the diff, but these suggestions are relevant and could be effective in resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its relevance and the provision of clear, actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
