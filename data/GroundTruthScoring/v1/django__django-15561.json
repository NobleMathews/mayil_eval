{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` to include a check for the `choices` attribute and skip SQL generation if the only change is to this attribute. However, the git diff provided shows a different approach to the issue. The git diff modifies the `_field_should_be_altered` method in `django/db/backends/base/schema.py` and adds a `non_db_attrs` attribute to the `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of centralizing the list of non-database affecting attributes and checking them in a base method. Instead, it suggests a solution specific to the SQLite backend, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of unnecessary SQL generation for database-transparent changes, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
