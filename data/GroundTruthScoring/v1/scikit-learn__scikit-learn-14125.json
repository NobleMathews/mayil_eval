    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests searching the codebase for occurrences of `SparseSeries` and replacing them with `Series` with sparse values, which is a reasonable approach to handle the deprecation of `SparseSeries`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which specifically addresses the issue by modifying the `type_of_target` function to include a check for both `SparseSeries` and `SparseArray` and raises a ValueError if either is encountered. The RESPONSE fails to mention the need to handle `SparseArray` and does not provide specific guidance on updating the `type_of_target` function, which is the core of the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating test cases and checking Travis CI logs, which, while potentially useful, are not directly related to the code change required to fix the issue. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that may need to be reviewed, but these are not directly related to the git diff provided. Overall, the RESPONSE offers some general advice that could be relevant to handling the deprecation of `SparseSeries` but does not provide actionable guidance closely aligned with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
