    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the presence of `tests/__init__.py` and ensuring it contains the necessary package declaration code, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of module discovery. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific regression issue described, which is related to the existence of `conftest.py` affecting package discovery with importlib and pythonpath mode. The git diff provided shows a change in the `insert_missing_modules` function in `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`, which involves handling `ModuleNotFoundError` by creating a dummy module when `sys.meta_path` is empty. The RESPONSE fails to mention or address this specific solution or provide any alternative that would resolve the issue. It also incorrectly references a code snippet that is not part of the git diff or the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant and lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
