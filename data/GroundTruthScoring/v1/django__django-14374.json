    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to update the usage of `now()` and related functions to the modern recommended approach, which is the core of the issue. It correctly identifies the need to replace `datetime.utcnow()`, `datetime.utcfromtimestamp()`, and `datetime.utctimetuple()` with timezone-aware equivalents. The RESPONSE also includes an updated `now()` function that aligns with the git diff's approach of using `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` when `settings.USE_TZ` is `True`. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation and examples to reflect the new usage, which is part of the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not cover all the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of `from calendar import timegm` and the adjustments to the `http_date` function usage. It also does not mention the specific updates to the `sitemap` and `feedgenerator` files, among others, that are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a significant portion of the solution, it is not exhaustive in covering all the changes in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
