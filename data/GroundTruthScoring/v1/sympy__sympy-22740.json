    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests rewriting the Heaviside function with Min using Piecewise and then simplifying the expression before lambdifying it, which aligns with the solution discovered by the user in the ISSUE description. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the use of 'simplify_logic' to handle ITE constructs, which is in line with the git diff that introduces a 'print_cond' function to handle ITE conditions within the Piecewise printer. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made to the '_print_NDimArray' method in the git diff, but this is not central to the specific problem of lambdifying Heaviside(Min(x, y)). The RESPONSE's suggestion to simplify the Piecewise expression is a valid alternative to the git diff's approach of modifying the printer, as both aim to resolve the issue of incompatible ITE constructs. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for providing a clear, actionable, and highly relevant solution to the ISSUE.",
