    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing changes between versions of pytest and reverting or fixing the behavior if a regression is found. It also recommends verifying the interaction between the `--pdb` flag and skipped tests. While these are reasonable steps in a general debugging process, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by refactoring the check for skipped tests into a separate function `_is_skipped` and using this function to conditionally skip teardown in the presence of the `--pdb` flag. The RESPONSE does not mention refactoring or the introduction of a new function, nor does it address the specific changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
