    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the ISSUE described. It suggests adding a `_from_testcase` attribute to the `Atomic` class, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of the same attribute. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the `TestCase` class to set this attribute to `True`, which is in line with the git diff's intent to differentiate transactions created by `TestCase`. Furthermore, the RESPONSE proposes updating the `__enter__` method to check for the `_from_testcase` attribute, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to the `__enter__` method logic. The RESPONSE also suggests implementing a stack to keep track of active transactions, which is exactly what the git diff does by adding the `atomic_blocks` list to the `BaseDatabaseWrapper` class. Lastly, the RESPONSE's mention of adjusting the durability check and ensuring that `TransactionTestCase` does not set the `_from_testcase` attribute is relevant and aligns with the git diff's changes to the durability check logic. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to the `__exit__` method and the removal of the `_ensure_durability` flag, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance, it does not capture all aspects of the git diff, resulting in a score of 7.",
