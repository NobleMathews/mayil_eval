    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps and potential code changes to resolve the issue with Sphinx documentation generation and cross-referencing classes with ambiguous unqualified names. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the 'make_xref' method in 'sphinx/domains/python.py' and an update to 'sphinx/util/docfields.py', which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'resolve_xref' method and setting a configuration value, which are not part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of resolving unqualified names, it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
