    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying Python and PyTest versions for compatibility with the walrus operator and refactoring the test to avoid using the walrus operator within the assertion. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant by addressing the use of the walrus operator, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a comprehensive update to the PyTest assertion rewriter to handle the walrus operator correctly, including handling variable reassignment and ensuring the correct behavior of assert statements. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide a similar level of detail in its guidance. Instead, it suggests a workaround by avoiding the walrus operator, which does not align with the git diff's approach to fixing the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
