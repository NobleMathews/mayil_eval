    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with internationalization in Django, suggesting checks and potential modifications in various parts of the Django framework. It correctly identifies that the issue is related to Django's handling of language codes with script and region subtags and provides a series of steps to investigate and potentially resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific regex pattern in the `language_code_prefix_re` variable within `trans_real.py`, which is the core of the git diff solution. The git diff shows a precise change in the regex pattern to allow for language codes with up to two subtags (script and region), which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does offer some actionable advice, such as checking the `LocalePrefixPattern` class and reviewing the `process_response` method, which could lead the developer in the right direction. However, it lacks the specificity and direct relevance to the regex pattern change shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not provide a complete solution to the issue described.",
