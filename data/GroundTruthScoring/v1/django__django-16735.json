    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying settings and reviewing Django release notes, which are general troubleshooting steps but do not address the specific issue described. It also suggests adding a non-prefixed pattern for the admin URL as a workaround, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach of modifying the `language_prefix` method to correctly handle the `prefix_default_language` setting. The RESPONSE does not mention updating the `get_language` function to `get_supported_language_variant` from `django.utils.translation`, which is a key part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with `i18n_patterns` and `prefix_default_language`, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
