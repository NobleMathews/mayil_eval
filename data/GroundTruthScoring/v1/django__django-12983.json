    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provide a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and precise solution to the issue with the `slugify` function in `django/utils/text.py`. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `slugify` function and provides the exact change that needs to be made to the code, which is to adjust the `strip` method call to remove leading and trailing spaces, dashes, and underscores. This change is in direct alignment with the git diff provided, which also modifies the `slugify` function to strip leading and trailing dashes and underscores. The RESPONSE even includes the correct file path and the context of the code that needs to be changed, making it highly actionable and relevant. The RESPONSE is effectively the same as the git diff, providing the developer with the exact guidance needed to resolve the issue.",
