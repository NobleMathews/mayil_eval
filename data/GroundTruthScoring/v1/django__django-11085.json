    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the 'magic' attribute has a 'contribute_to_class' method or wrapping it in a descriptor that does, and modifying the 'PageBase' metaclass to add the 'magic' attribute back into the dictionary after the call to 'super().__new__'. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of custom metaclasses not being able to access the attribute dict, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the Django model base class itself, where it separates attributes with and without 'contribute_to_class' into different dictionaries before creating the new class, and then adds the contributable attributes back to the class. The RESPONSE does not address modifying the Django model base class, which is the core of the issue and the solution provided in the git diff. Instead, it suggests a workaround that involves modifying the custom metaclass and using a descriptor for the 'magic' attribute, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the handling of attributes in metaclasses, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
