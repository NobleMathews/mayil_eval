    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing PR #10758 and potentially reverting or modifying changes, ensuring correct use of the walrus operator, modifying the test function to avoid using the walrus operator, and testing with different pytest versions. However, it does not provide any specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which includes detailed code changes to the pytest assertion rewriting mechanism. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippet checks that do not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable insight or meaningful information that would assist the developer in fixing the issue as per the git diff.",
