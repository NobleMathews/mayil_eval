    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an index on the `parent_id` column and changing the `on_delete` behavior to `models.CASCADE`, which are not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the deletion process in Django's ORM, specifically optimizing the handling of field updates during deletion and adding a `lazy_sub_objs` attribute to deletion handlers to improve performance. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or offer a similar solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing custom delete methods or signals and testing changes, which are general good practices but do not align with the specific changes in the git diff. The code snippets provided in the RESPONSE are also not directly relevant to the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
