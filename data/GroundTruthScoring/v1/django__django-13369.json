    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is relevant and actionable, closely aligning with the git diff or achieving similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the expression to explicitly specify the `output_field` as an `IntegerField`, which is a valid and actionable solution to the issue described. This approach directly addresses the error message that indicates a need to set the `output_field` due to mixed types in the expression. While the git diff shows a change in the Django source code to handle the combination of IntegerField types, the RESPONSE offers an alternative solution that can be implemented by the developer in their own code without modifying the Django source. This alternative is effective and relevant, as it would resolve the FieldError by ensuring that the expression has a consistent output type. The RESPONSE does not directly modify the Django source code as the git diff does, but it achieves the desired result of fixing the issue, which is why it receives a high score. However, it does not score a perfect 10 because it does not match the git diff's approach of updating the Django source code to handle the type combination internally.",
