{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately instructs the developer to update the default value of `n_estimators` from 10 to 100 in the RandomForest classes, which is the main issue described. It correctly identifies the need to modify the RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor classes in the `_forest.py` file, which is consistent with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also appropriately suggests updating the documentation and comments to reflect the change, as well as checking for any tests that rely on the default value. Additionally, it advises adding an entry to the changelog or release notes, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to add a deprecation warning for the change from 10 to 'warn' and then to 100, which is included in the git diff. However, this omission does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the main goal of changing the default value is still achieved. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
