    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the addition of a deprecation warning to the `classes_` property in the `DecisionTreeRegressor` class, which aligns with the ISSUE's requirement to deprecate the `classes_` attribute. It also correctly identifies the need to ensure the deprecation warning is only triggered when accessing the `classes_` property, not when calling the `fit` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `_classes` attribute in the parent class and adding a test case in `test_tree.py`, which is relevant to the ISSUE.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff. The git diff shows changes in the `export.py` and `tree.py` files, including the use of the `is_classifier` function to conditionally set `class_names` and `self.tree_`, as well as restructuring the `fit` method and adding deprecation warnings for `classes_` and `n_classes_` properties. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these specific changes, nor does it address the restructuring of the `fit` method or the addition of the `is_classifier` checks. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track with deprecation, it does not capture the full scope of changes presented in the git diff, which includes more than just adding a deprecation warning.",
