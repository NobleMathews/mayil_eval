    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is somewhat aligned with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `generate_index_entries` function to categorize special character entries under a single \"Symbols\" category, which is in line with the git diff's intent to sort index entries correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, such as adjusting the `keyfunc` to sort entries with a new tuple structure that separates symbols from alphanumeric characters. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring unique anchors for each \"Symbols\" section and updating navigation links, which are not part of the git diff but could be considered relevant to the broader issue of handling multiple \"Symbols\" sections. The RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or directly reference the `keyfunc` modifications, which are central to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and does not fully address the issue as resolved by the git diff.",
