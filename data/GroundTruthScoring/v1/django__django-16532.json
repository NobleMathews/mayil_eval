    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps involving the explicit definition of a 'through' model for the ManyToManyField relationship and the creation of new migrations to handle the renaming of the 'Incident' model to 'Folder'. While this approach could theoretically resolve the issue of duplicate model names in M2M relationships, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a simplification of the database_forwards method by using a new method called '_alter_many_to_many', which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the specific traceback error provided in the issue description and instead offers a more complex solution that involves manual intervention and additional migrations. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to solve the problem of renaming models in M2M relationships, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
