    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of missing parameter validation for the 'n_neighbors' parameter in the NearestNeighbors estimator. It suggests updating the '__init__' method and the 'kneighbors' method to include type checks for 'n_neighbors' and to raise a TypeError if it is not an integer. This aligns well with the git diff, which also adds checks for 'n_neighbors' to ensure it is an integer and raises appropriate errors if not. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it uses 'isinstance(n_neighbors, numbers.Integral)' instead of 'np.issubdtype(type(n_neighbors), np.integer)', but the intent and outcome are effectively the same. The RESPONSE also includes a helpful error message, which is in line with the issue's request for a more helpful error message. The RESPONSE does not include the additional check for 'n_neighbors <= 0' that is present in the git diff, which is why it does not score higher. However, the RESPONSE is still highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
