{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to implement the feature request using __slots__ in the `SafeData` and `SafeString` classes, which is exactly what the git diff shows. It correctly identifies the need to define __slots__ as an empty tuple in both classes to prevent the creation of __dict__ for instances, which aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE also advises checking the codebase for any instances where attributes are set on `SafeString` or `SafeData`, updating the test suite, and running the full test suite to ensure no other parts of the codebase are affected, which are all prudent steps in the implementation process. Additionally, it suggests measuring the memory savings to confirm the improvement, which is relevant to the issue's description of memory usage concerns. The RESPONSE also correctly notes that the code snippet provided already uses __slots__, indicating that the feature request is implemented in the snippet. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes a link to a code snippet that is not part of the git diff or the issue description, which is not necessary for the solution but does not detract from the overall quality of the RESPONSE.",
