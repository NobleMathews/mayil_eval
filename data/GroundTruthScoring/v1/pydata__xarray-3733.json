    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the `polyfit` method in xarray, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff provided. The git diff shows a comprehensive implementation of the `polyfit` method, including handling of Dask arrays, and updates to multiple files such as `__init__.py`, `computation.py`, `dask_array_ops.py`, `dataarray.py`, `dataset.py`, `duck_array_ops.py`, and `nputils.py`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, offers a simplified version of the implementation and does not include the necessary changes to multiple files as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the addition of the `polyval` function, which is included in the git diff. The RESPONSE also lacks the detailed handling of edge cases, missing values, and compatibility with the rest of the xarray API that is evident in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content and does not provide a solution that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide the necessary guidance to implement the feature as comprehensively as the git diff does.",
