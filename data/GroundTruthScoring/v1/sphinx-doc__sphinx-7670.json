    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the steps needed to add support for C++20 requires clauses in the Sphinx C++ domain, which is in line with the git diff provided. It correctly identifies the need to update the `ASTRequiresClause` class, modify the `ASTTemplateDeclarationPrefix` class, and update the `_parse_requires_clause` method and `describe_signature` methods, which are all reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code example for the `describe_signature` method in the `ASTRequiresClause` class, which is similar to the changes seen in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests writing unit tests and updating documentation, which are good practices but not directly shown in the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes or the level of detail seen in the git diff, such as the specific modifications to the `ASTDeclaration` constructor or the handling of the `trailingRequiresClause`. It also does not mention the changes to the `_parse_template_declaration_prefix` method to return an optional `ASTTemplateDeclarationPrefix`, which is present in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it is not as detailed and does not cover all the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
