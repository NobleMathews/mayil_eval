    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to add support for fixtures compression in the `dumpdata` command, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests adding a new command-line argument for specifying the desired compression format and updating the file opening logic to handle compression, which aligns with the git diff's approach to handling different compression formats.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff includes the addition of import statements for gzip, os, bz2, and lzma, as well as conditional checks for the availability of bz2 and lzma, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the git diff provides a more detailed and specific implementation for handling different file extensions and issuing warnings for unsupported extensions, which is not covered in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does mention the need to handle cases where the compression library is not available and to provide user-friendly messages for unsupported formats, which is a good practice and somewhat aligns with the git diff's approach. However, the RESPONSE's code snippet does not reflect the actual changes in the git diff, such as the detailed handling of different compression formats and the specific warnings.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and is partially relevant but lacks the completeness and specificity of the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it provides a starting point but does not fully align with the git diff's solution.",
