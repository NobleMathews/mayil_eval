    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately instructs the developer to search the codebase for instances of the specific exceptions that are now aliases of OSError and to replace them with OSError. This aligns with the git diff, which shows the replacement of IOError, EnvironmentError, and other exceptions with OSError or specific subclasses of OSError where appropriate.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises simplifying exception handling blocks that catch multiple exceptions now unified under OSError, which is consistent with the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating any related documentation or comments, which is a good practice though not explicitly shown in the git diff. This does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE as it is a relevant and useful suggestion for maintaining codebase clarity.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific subclasses of OSError used in the git diff, such as FileExistsError and BrokenPipeError, but this is a minor omission as the main focus is on replacing the aliases with OSError, which the RESPONSE covers effectively.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a comprehensive and accurate guide for addressing the issue described, closely matching the approach taken in the git diff.",
