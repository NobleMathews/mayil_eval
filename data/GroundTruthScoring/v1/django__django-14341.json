    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue described, which is the use of the cursor after it has been closed. It provides a clear and actionable solution by suggesting to move the 'return bool(cursor.rowcount)' line inside the 'with' block, which is exactly what the git diff shows as the necessary change. The RESPONSE also includes a corrected code snippet that reflects the change proposed in the git diff, ensuring that the cursor is not used after closure. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which could help the developer locate the issue and understand the context of the change. The RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and addresses the issue comprehensively, making it deserving of a score of 10.",
