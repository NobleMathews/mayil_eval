    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue of decorated inherited methods not inheriting documentation in Sphinx.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the MyClass implementation by using `update_wrapper` from `functools` to wrap the `my_method` and `my_other_method` functions after applying `lru_cache`. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the `getdoc` function in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to handle inherited decorated methods and updates the calls to `getdoc` in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to pass additional arguments (`self.parent` and `self.object_name`). The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff and instead provides an alternative that is not supported by the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the actual fix required, which involves changes to the Sphinx extension code, not the user's MyClass implementation. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a valid alternative solution.",
