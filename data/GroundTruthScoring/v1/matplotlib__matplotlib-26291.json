    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue by suggesting to force a draw of the figure before calling `inset_axes` to ensure that the renderer is initialized. This approach is relevant and could potentially resolve the issue of the renderer being `None` at the time `inset_axes` is called. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff, which adds a check for `None` and initializes the renderer within the `__call__` method of `AnchoredLocatorBase`. However, the RESPONSE's alternative solution of forcing a draw on the figure is a valid workaround that addresses the root cause of the issue, which is the renderer not being available. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a different but effective approach to solving the problem. It does not score higher because it does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the library code, but it is still a viable solution that could be implemented by the user without changing the library.",
