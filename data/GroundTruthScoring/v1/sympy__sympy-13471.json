    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It suggests handling the 'L' suffix in Python 3 by stripping it before converting the string to an integer, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to replace the use of 'long' with 'int' in Python 3, which is implied by the git diff since 'long' is not used there.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by suggesting a version check to maintain compatibility with Python 2, which is not present in the git diff. This is a reasonable suggestion, as it ensures that the code will work correctly in both Python 2 and Python 3 environments. However, the git diff does not include this check, possibly because the codebase may have dropped support for Python 2, or it is assumed that the code will only run in a Python 3 environment.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue. While these snippets are not directly related to the fix provided in the git diff, they show an understanding of the broader context of the issue and provide additional locations in the codebase that the developer might want to review. This does not directly contribute to solving the issue but shows a thorough approach.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, with the addition of a version check that is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly due to the version check, but it achieves a similar result and is relevant to the issue described.",
