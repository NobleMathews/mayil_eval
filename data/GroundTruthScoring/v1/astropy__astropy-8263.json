    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue might be due to a regression in `astropy` version 3.1 and provides general advice on checking for unnecessary conversions and opening an issue on the `astropy` GitHub repository. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows a specific change in the `astropy/units/core.py` file to handle a case where a unit with a single base and a negative power needs to be re-sorted. The RESPONSE fails to identify the specific problem in the code related to negative powers and does not suggest modifying the `CompositeUnit` initialization to handle this case. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the implementation of the changes shown in the git diff. It does, however, correctly identify the area of the codebase that is likely causing the issue, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
