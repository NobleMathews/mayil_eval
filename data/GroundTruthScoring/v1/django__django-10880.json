    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the location of the issue in the `as_sql` method of the `Count` class and suggests adding a space after 'DISTINCT' when `distinct=True`. The provided code snippet matches the git diff, ensuring that the space is added correctly. The RESPONSE also includes additional guidance on checking the relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to understand the context better, although this additional information is not strictly necessary to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes extra guidance and does not specify the exact file path, but it effectively addresses the issue and provides a solution that would resolve the problem described. Therefore, it receives a high score.",
