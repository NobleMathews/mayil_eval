    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `:noindex:` option to suppress the automatic addition of the constructor signature to the generated heading when using `autoclass` in Sphinx. However, this suggestion does not align with the git diff provided, which introduces a new configuration option `autodoc_class_signature` with the value 'separated' to control the inclusion of the constructor signature in the class header. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as modifying the `ClassDocumenter` class to handle the new configuration option and updating the `get_doc` method to handle documentation for `__init__` and `__new__` methods differently based on the configuration. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
