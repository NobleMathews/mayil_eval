    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to replace the custom implementation of the `escape()` function with the standard library's `html.escape()` and to ensure that the `SafeString` wrapper is still applied. The RESPONSE also addresses the concern about the change in the escaped character for the apostrophe and suggests documenting this change, which is in line with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE does not include the import statement for the html module, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also provides additional guidance on testing and updating documentation, which, while not present in the git diff, is relevant and useful for the developer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff, with a minor deduction for the slight omission.",
