    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described. Instead, it offers general advice on ensuring that reStructuredText documentation ends with a blank line, which is somewhat related to the warning message described in the issue. However, the RESPONSE fails to address the specific problem in the Python script or the Sphinx extension that is causing the warning. The git diff provided shows that the solution involves appending a blank line to the end of the docstring within the Sphinx autodoc extension, which the RESPONSE does not mention or suggest. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves a similar result. The links to code snippets in the RESPONSE are not directly related to the issue at hand and do not provide a clear path to resolving the warning message. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks actionable content that matches the git diff.",
