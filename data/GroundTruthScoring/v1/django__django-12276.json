{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary changes to address the issue. It suggests moving the `use_required_attribute` method from `ClearableFileInput` to `FileInput` and modifying it to not add the `required` attribute when initial data is present, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to ensure that `ClearableFileInput` does not override the `use_required_attribute` method from `FileInput`, aligning with the removal of the method in the git diff. The RESPONSE includes code snippets and references to the relevant lines in the repository, providing a developer with a clear path to implement the fix. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes additional information about checking other code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff.",
