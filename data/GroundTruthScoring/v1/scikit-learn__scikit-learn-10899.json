    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to address the issue of setting the `idf_` attribute on a `TfidfTransformer` object, which is the core of the issue described. It correctly identifies the need for `use_idf` to be set to `True` and for the length of the `idf_` vector to match the size of the `vocabulary_` attribute. The RESPONSE also suggests using the `idf_` setter method, which aligns with the git diff that introduces setter methods for the `idf_` attribute in both `TfidfTransformer` and `TfidfVectorizer` classes.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific validation that is added in the git diff for the `TfidfVectorizer` class, which checks if the length of the `idf_` vector matches the vocabulary size and raises a ValueError if it does not. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not fully aligned with the git diff, as it does not show the use of the setter method or the validation that should occur when setting the `idf_` attribute. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the git diff or the issue at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not perfect due to the missing details about the validation and the use of the setter method as implemented in the git diff. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
