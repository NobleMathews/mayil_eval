    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `collect_const()` function in `sympy/simplify/radsimp.py` to handle `Rational` numbers correctly when `Numbers=True`. However, the git diff provided shows changes made to the `Factors` class in `sympy/core/exprtools.py`, specifically to handle rational coefficients in the `__init__` method. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests changes to a different file and function. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described in the git diff, which is about handling rational coefficients in the `Factors` class. However, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of `collect_const()` not collecting rationals, but it does not provide the correct location or method to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
