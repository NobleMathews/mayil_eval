    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section. The issue is related to the handling of `pending_xref_condition` nodes in Sphinx, and the git diff provides a solution by modifying the `sphinx/transforms/post_transforms/__init__.py` file to properly handle these nodes. The RESPONSE, however, suggests that the problem lies with the `sphinx-qt-documentation` plugin and provides a generic and incorrect solution that involves modifying the `missing_reference` function in the plugin, which is not aligned with the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant suggestions and code snippets that do not contribute to resolving the issue. There is no actionable guidance that matches the git diff or provides a valid alternative approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and misguided, offering no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
