    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying various parts of the Django codebase to ensure that `STATIC_URL` is not modified if it is a fully qualified URL. It also suggests ensuring that `STATIC_URL` ends with a slash and checking the application of `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix was much simpler and did not involve changes to multiple files or the checks mentioned in the RESPONSE. The git diff indicates that the fix was to remove the URLValidator check and adjust the condition to not apply a prefix to absolute paths and URLs starting with 'http://' or 'https://'.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of simplifying the condition in the `_add_script_prefix` function. Instead, it suggests a broader and more complex set of changes across multiple files, which is not supported by the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the issue of `STATIC_URL` being incorrectly modified, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not highly effective in assisting a developer to fix the issue as per the git diff.",
