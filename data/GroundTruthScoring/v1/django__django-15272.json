{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the `optimizemigration` management command, which is the issue at hand. It correctly outlines the steps to import necessary classes, create the command class, define arguments, and implement the handle method to optimize the migration. The RESPONSE also includes a simplified version of the `handle` method, which closely matches the logic in the git diff, such as loading the migration, optimizing it, and writing the optimized migration back to disk. The RESPONSE correctly advises on handling the `--check` flag and verbosity output, which are also present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the exact code for handling exceptions and edge cases, which are present in the git diff, but it does mention the need to handle them, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE is highly actionable and provides nearly all the necessary guidance to implement the command as per the git diff. The inclusion of code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the codebase adds value and context for the developer.",
