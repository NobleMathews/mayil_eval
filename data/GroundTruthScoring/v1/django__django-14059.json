    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__init__` method to raise a `TypeError` if a field is specified in both `args` and `kwargs`, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the check should be done before calling `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)`, which is consistent with the git diff's placement of the check before the remaining kwargs are processed.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE specifies the modification for the `Article` model specifically, while the git diff shows a change in the base model file `django/db/models/base.py`. This is a slight deviation from the git diff, which applies the change more generally to all models, not just `Article`. Despite this, the RESPONSE's approach is still valid and would resolve the issue for the `Article` model.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is very similar to the git diff, with the exception of using `self.__class__.__qualname__` instead of `cls.__qualname__`. This difference is minor and does not significantly impact the effectiveness of the solution.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides additional value by suggesting code snippets to check, which could be helpful for developers looking to understand the context of the issue within the codebase.",
