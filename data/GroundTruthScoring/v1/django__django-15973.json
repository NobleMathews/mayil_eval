    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps that could help troubleshoot the issue described, such as ensuring the correct reference to the 'through' model, checking the 'INSTALLED_APPS' setting, and verifying the 'ForeignKey' fields in the 'through' model. These suggestions are relevant to the issue and could potentially lead to a solution. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff, which modifies the autodetector.py file to resolve the AttributeError by using 'field.remote_field.through' instead of 'remote_field_model'. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Django internals or the autodetector, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat helpful, it does not align closely with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
