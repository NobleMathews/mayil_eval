    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `handle_app_config` method in `sqlsequencereset.py` to raise a `CommandError` if no sequences are found and the backend supports sequence reset. It also suggests adding a check for `connection.ops.supports_sequence_reset` before raising the `CommandError` and updating the error message accordingly.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE addresses the issue of informing the user when no sequences are found, it does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff adds a simple conditional check to print a message to `stderr` when no sequences are found, rather than raising a `CommandError`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to raise an error is a significant deviation from the git diff's solution and could lead to a different user experience, as raising an error would halt the execution of the command, whereas printing a message would not.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE introduces the idea of checking if the backend supports sequence reset, which is not part of the git diff or the original issue description. While this could be a useful feature, it is not directly related to the issue at hand, which is to inform the user when no sequences are found.\n\nThe RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it does address the issue of informing the user but does not align with the git diff's approach and introduces additional changes that are not requested in the issue description.",
