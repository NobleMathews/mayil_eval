    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to receive a score above 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying that `self.random_state` is a number and raising a `ValueError` if it is not, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff does not include any checks or exceptions for the type of `self.random_state`. Instead, it modifies the way the random state is handled by always using `check_random_state(self.random_state)` to initialize `rng` and then conditionally setting a `_random_seed` attribute if warm starting is not used or the model is not already fitted.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests extracting a random seed from a `RandomState` instance and using it for `train_test_split`, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff uses a new attribute `_random_seed` for the random state in `train_test_split` and other places where a random seed is needed.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to ensure that `self.random_state` is set to an integer or `None` when initializing the `GBDT` class, which is not related to the changes in the git diff.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the changes made in the git diff. The git diff focuses on modifying the handling of the random state within the `fit` method, not on checking or raising errors based on the type of `self.random_state`.",
