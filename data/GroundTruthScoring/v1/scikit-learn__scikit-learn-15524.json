    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff adds a property '_pairwise' to the GridSearchCV class to allow cross-validation to see 'precomputed' metrics, which directly addresses the issue of using a precomputed metric with KNeighborsClassifier in a nested cross-validation setup. The RESPONSE, however, suggests modifying the code to use a pipeline and does not mention or address the addition of the '_pairwise' property. This suggests a different approach that does not reflect the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff or achieves similar results in the context of the issue described.",
