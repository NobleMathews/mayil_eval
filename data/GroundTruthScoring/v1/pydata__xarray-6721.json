    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general suggestions for inspecting and potentially modifying various parts of the xarray codebase to ensure that data is not loaded into memory when accessing the `chunks` attribute. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to the incorrect attribute access in the `get_chunksizes` function. The git diff provided shows that the fix involves changing `v.data` to `v._data` within the `get_chunksizes` function to prevent loading the entire dataset into memory. The RESPONSE fails to mention this specific change or provide a similar alternative solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE does suggest ensuring that `Dataset.chunks` uses the `encoding` attribute from the underlying DataArrays to determine chunk sizes, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance on how to implement this or how it relates to the specific problem of loading the entire dataset into memory.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a list of code snippets to check, which are not directly related to the issue at hand. The provided links and line numbers do not correspond to the actual code that needs to be modified according to the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. It does not provide the specific guidance needed to resolve the issue, and the additional suggestions and code snippets do not add value in the context of the git diff.",
