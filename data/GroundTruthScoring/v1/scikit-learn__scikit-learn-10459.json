    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE closely aligns with the git diff by suggesting updates to the `check_array` function to accept a string for the `force_all_finite` parameter with the new option 'allow-nan'. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the `_assert_all_finite` function to handle the new option by setting `allow_nan=True` when `force_all_finite` is 'allow-nan'. Additionally, the RESPONSE correctly states that the `_assert_all_finite_element_wise` function should be called with the correct `allow_nan` argument, which is in line with the git diff changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly updates the documentation of `check_array` to reflect the new behavior of the `force_all_finite` parameter. It accurately states that no changes are required in the `_assert_finite_or_nan` function, as it is a private function and not described in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention unnecessary changes to unrelated functions or files, which is consistent with the git diff. It also provides a clear and actionable guide for reviewing and updating calls to `check_array` within preprocessing methods, which is relevant to the issue.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score is that it includes a mention of the `_assert_all_finite_element_wise` function, which does not appear in the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE, as the main focus is on the `check_array` and `_assert_all_finite` functions, which are correctly addressed.",
