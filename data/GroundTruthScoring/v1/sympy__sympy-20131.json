{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a method `validate_graph` to check for cycles and modifying existing methods to use this validation. While the idea of validating the graph is somewhat relevant to the issue of detecting inconsistencies, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding warnings within the `vel` method when inconsistencies are detected. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of warnings, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests raising an exception or returning a value indicating an invalid graph, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff instead adds checks within the existing `vel` method to detect cycles and multiple valid neighbors, and then provides warnings to the user. The RESPONSE also suggests using a topological sort algorithm and handling DAEs, which are not part of the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
