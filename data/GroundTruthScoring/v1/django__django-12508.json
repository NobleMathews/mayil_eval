    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new argument `-c` or `--command` to the `dbshell` command to execute SQL directly, which is in line with the ISSUE's request for a feature to run specific SQL directly with `dbshell`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows a comprehensive implementation that includes modifications to the `CommandError` class to support a `returncode` attribute, updates to exception handling in `run_from_argv`, and extensive changes to the database client classes to support additional parameters. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes and instead provides a high-level overview with pseudo code that does not reflect the actual changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the task at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
