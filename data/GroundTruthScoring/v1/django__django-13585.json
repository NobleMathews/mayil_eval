    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT` setting to reflect a 3-month lifetime in seconds, which is not directly related to the issue of token incompatibility between Django versions. While this change might be necessary for the developer's specific use case, it does not address the core issue of interpreting the token creation time correctly. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `_num_seconds` method and implementing a compatibility check in the `check_token` method to differentiate between tokens generated with different Django versions. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a clear implementation for these suggestions, and the provided code snippets are generic and incomplete. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which specifically adds a check for legacy tokens and adjusts the timestamp calculation for pre-Django 3.1 tokens. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that would lead to a solution similar to the one in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
