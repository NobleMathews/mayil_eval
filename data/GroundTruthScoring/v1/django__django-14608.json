    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ErrorList` class to accept an additional parameter for the error type and then using this modified class in the `non_form_errors` method in `django/forms/formsets.py`. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the `ErrorList` class. Instead, it directly modifies the instantiation of the `error_class` within the `full_clean` method of the `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` by adding an `error_class` parameter with the value 'nonform'.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of directly modifying the `error_class` instantiation and instead proposes a broader change to the `ErrorList` class, which is not supported by the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes extensive instructions on updating documentation and writing tests, which, while important, are not part of the git diff and do not directly address the code changes needed to resolve the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of adding a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
