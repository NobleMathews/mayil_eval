{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the URL generation for readonly ForeignKey fields in a custom Admin Site and suggests modifying the `get_admin_url` function to include the `current_app` parameter, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also provides an example of how the `reverse` function should be used, which is consistent with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further by providing additional context and examples from other parts of the Django admin codebase where the `current_app` parameter is used correctly. This additional information is helpful and relevant to the issue, although it is not strictly necessary to fix the specific problem described.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may need to be reviewed, which is useful for a developer looking to ensure that the entire admin site behaves consistently. However, these links are not directly related to the specific change in the git diff, which is why the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue and offers additional context that could be valuable to the developer in fixing the issue and ensuring consistency across the admin site.",
