    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `imageset` function to correctly include the constant part of the complex number in the output, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of the `imageset` function dropping the constant `1` in the output when using complex numbers. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly identifies the file to be modified as `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py` and suggests changes to the handling of the intersection with real numbers, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the actual changes are made in the `sympy/sets/handlers/functions.py` file and involve modifying the `_set_function` to handle the canonical shift and modulus operation for complex numbers correctly. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It also includes a large amount of irrelevant information, such as code snippets and links to various parts of the codebase that are not directly related to the fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
