    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE begins by misunderstanding the issue, suggesting that the `RangeSlider` is designed for a single value rather than a range, which is incorrect. The `RangeSlider` is indeed meant to handle a range of values, and the issue is with initializing it with specific values, not with its fundamental design. The RESPONSE then correctly identifies that the `IndexError` is due to an incorrect assumption about the `poly.xy` array size but fails to provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or addresses the core issue effectively.\n\nThe proposed solution in the RESPONSE does not match the git diff and introduces a check for the value being a tuple, which is not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `poly.xy` array in a way that does not reflect the changes in the git diff. The git diff shows that the code needs to handle both 'vertical' and 'horizontal' orientations and update the handle positions accordingly, which the RESPONSE does not address.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It does not address the orientation handling, which is a key part of the git diff, and it introduces changes that are not supported by the git diff, such as the tuple check. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
