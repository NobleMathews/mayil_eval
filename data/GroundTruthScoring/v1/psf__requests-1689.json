    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `str = unicode` declaration in `compat.py` and modifying the `prepare_content_length` function to use `str()` instead of `builtin_str()`. However, the git diff shows that the correct solution is to use `builtin_str()` to cast the content length to a string, not to remove the `str = unicode` declaration or to use `str()`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises checking the `super_len` function to ensure it returns an integer, which is not addressed in the git diff but is not necessarily incorrect advice. It's a reasonable step to ensure that the length is an integer before converting it to a string.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but it does not directly help in resolving the issue as the git diff does. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the nature of the problem (the Content-Length header being a unicode object), but it fails to provide the correct actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
