    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding two new configuration options (`html_add_permalinks_html` and `viewcode_source_html`) and modifying the HTML writer to use these options when generating permalinks and source code links. This approach is somewhat aligned with the issue's request for customizable HTML links for permalinks and source code links. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff provided, which implements a different solution by deprecating the `html_add_permalinks` option and introducing `html_permalinks` and `html_permalinks_icon` options instead. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the necessary migration function or the deprecation warnings that are part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also includes a reference to modifying `sphinx/ext/linkcode.py`, which is not part of the git diff and does not address the issue's focus on permalinks customization. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a complete or effective alternative solution.",
