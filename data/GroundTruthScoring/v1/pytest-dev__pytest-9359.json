    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff. It does not address the specific issue of the error message printing extra code lines in Python 3.9 due to a change in how line numbers are calculated for decorated functions and classes. The RESPONSE suggests generic steps such as reviewing code snippets and checking function return values, which are not relevant to the issue at hand. It also suggests updating pytest or using a different traceback option, which are not solutions reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves adjusting the line number calculation to account for decorators in Python 3.8 and newer, which the RESPONSE does not mention at all.",
