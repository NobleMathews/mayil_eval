    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the `autodoc_typehints` setting in `conf.py` to `'both'` or `'signature'`, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `autodoc/typehints.py` file where the `inspect.signature` function is modified to include `type_aliases` from the Sphinx configuration. This change is meant to address the issue of `autodoc_type_aliases` not working when `autodoc_typehints` is set to `'description'`. The RESPONSE does not address this specific change or provide a similar solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not offer actionable guidance on how to use these snippets to resolve the problem. The links are somewhat relevant as they point to areas in the code that handle type aliases and type hints, but they do not provide a clear path to a solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the settings related to the issue, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
