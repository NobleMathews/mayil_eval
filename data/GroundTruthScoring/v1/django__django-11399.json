    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of the steps needed to resolve the issue with the `lazy` class preparation caching in Django. It correctly identifies the need to change an instance variable to a class variable, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests replacing `self.__prepared` with `lazy._prepared`, which is a valid alternative to the git diff's approach of using `self.__class__.__prepared`. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating all references to the instance variable within the `lazy` class to reference the new class variable. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on where to find the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly, as it suggests using a different variable name (`lazy._prepared` instead of `self.__class__.__prepared`). Despite this, the RESPONSE's alternative is still a valid and effective solution to the issue, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
