    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 4 indicates that the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the changes needed to implement the feature of adding an option to input/output column units for fixed width tables in the `astropy.io.ascii.FixedWidth` reader and writer. It suggests extending the `FixedWidth` class to accept a new keyword argument for specifying the presence of a row of unit specifiers and modifying the `FixedWidthHeader` and `FixedWidthData` classes to handle the additional row for units when reading and writing.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a more comprehensive approach, including the addition of a `header_rows` attribute to handle multiple header rows, updates to the `write` method to handle the new header rows, and changes to the `__init__` methods of various classes to support the new functionality. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a `units_row` keyword argument and the associated methods does not match the approach taken in the git diff, which uses `header_rows` instead.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice, such as updating the splitter class and adding tests, which are relevant to the issue. However, it lacks the specific details and code changes shown in the git diff, such as handling the header rows in the `get_cols` method and the detailed implementation of the `write` method in the `FixedWidthData` class.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not provide a complete or accurate guide to implementing the feature as shown in the git diff. It offers a different approach that is not as effective or relevant as the one in the git diff, resulting in a score of 4.",
