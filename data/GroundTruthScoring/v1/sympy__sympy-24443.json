    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifications to the `_image()` function to ensure that `gens` is correctly initialized and to update the condition and assignment for checking if `r[i]` is in the list of generators of the domain. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue with the `_image()` function, it does not provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a complete refactoring of the `_check_homomorphism` function, including the removal of the problematic condition and assignment, and the introduction of a new approach using `symbols_to_domain_generators`. The RESPONSE does not mention this new approach or the refactoring of the function, and instead focuses on modifying the existing code structure, which is not in line with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not offer a solution that would effectively resolve the issue as the git diff does.",
