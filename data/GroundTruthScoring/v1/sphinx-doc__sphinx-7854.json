    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the Sphinx configuration file to recognize the 'optimize' attribute and using a macro to conditionally define the attribute for Sphinx documentation. However, this does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the Sphinx source code to support parsing of parameterized GNU style attributes directly.\n\nThe git diff indicates that the actual solution involves modifying the Sphinx source code to handle parameterized GNU style attributes by introducing a new class (ASTBaseParenExprList) and updating the ASTGnuAttribute and ASTParenExprList classes to use this new class. The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead offers a workaround that does not solve the underlying issue in the Sphinx codebase.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets to check, which could be misleading because the actual changes required are not in those snippets but are shown in the git diff provided. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or provides a viable alternative solution.",
