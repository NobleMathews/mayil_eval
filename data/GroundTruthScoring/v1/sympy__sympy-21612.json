    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'convert_frac' function in the file '_parse_latex_antlr.py' to fix the issue with parsing nested LaTeX fractions. However, the git diff provided indicates that the actual change was made in the 'sympy/printing/str.py' file, specifically modifying the condition within an if statement to include instances of 'Pow' along with 'Mul'. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests changes to a different file and a different function than what was actually modified. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach, as it does not address the same part of the codebase or the same logic that was changed in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
