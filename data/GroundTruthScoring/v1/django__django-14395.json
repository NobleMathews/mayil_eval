{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear explanation of the issue with the `CacheHandler.all` method and offers a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the problem of mass initialization of caches leading to I/O lags and suggests a modified `cache_all` method that includes an `initialized_only` parameter to control the behavior of cache initialization. This solution is similar to the git diff, which also introduces an `initialized_only` parameter and modifies the `all` method to conditionally return initialized caches. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it provides a more detailed explanation and an alternative way to implement the solution, but it achieves the same result and is relevant to the issue. Therefore, it deserves a high score for its utility in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
