    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to update the `parse_http_date` function to handle two-digit years correctly according to RFC 7231 and RFC 2822. It suggests replacing the hardcoded logic with a dynamic comparison against the current year, which aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that closely matches the git diff, with the correct logic for determining the century of a two-digit year. The only minor discrepancy is the use of `datetime.datetime.now(tz=tz).year` instead of `datetime.datetime.utcnow().year`, which does not significantly impact the correctness of the solution. The RESPONSE also correctly advises placing the updated logic within the existing try-except block and testing the function afterward. The inclusion of a link to the relevant code snippet in the repository is a helpful addition for the developer. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
