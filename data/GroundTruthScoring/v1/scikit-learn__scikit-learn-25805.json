    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several checks and verifications that are generally good practice when dealing with data shapes and function arguments in Python. However, it does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is related to the `check_consistent_length` function causing an error when using `CalibratedClassifierCV` with `eval_set` for a LGBM model. The git diff shows that the solution to the issue was to remove the check for consistent length within the `fit` method of `CalibratedClassifierCV`. The RESPONSE does not suggest modifying or removing this check, nor does it provide any alternative solution that would resolve the specific error encountered. Instead, it provides generic advice that, while potentially helpful in other contexts, does not align with the necessary changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the `fit_params` and the shapes of the data, but it lacks actionable content that would resolve the issue described. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
