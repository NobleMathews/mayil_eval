    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable suggestions, such as verifying the initial guess, ensuring correct substitution and differentiation, checking variable assumptions, plotting the function, and adjusting the numerical solver's settings. These are general troubleshooting steps that could be applied to various issues with numerical solvers like `nsolve`. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff, which include clarifying the documentation regarding the use of `mpmath.findroot`, the behavior of functions near the root, and the handling of the function's numerator and denominator. The RESPONSE does not mention the new alternative provided in the git diff, which suggests that users may try using the numerator of the function if the verification of the solution fails. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader context of the issue with `nsolve`, but it lacks direct alignment with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it scores a 3 as it provides some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
