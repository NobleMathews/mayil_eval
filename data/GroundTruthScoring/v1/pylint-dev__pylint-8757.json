    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general investigation into the handling of the `--jobs` argument and the behavior of parallel linting, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates specific changes to the `similar.py` and `parallel.py` files, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests checking for proper imports and print statements in the modules, which is not related to the issue of different outputs with different job counts. The RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of `self.close()` in `similar.py` and the modification of the comment in `parallel.py`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff.",
