    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to change the 'lexer' parameter from 'python3' to 'text' within the 'pastebin.py' file, which is the exact change made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests testing the '--pastebin' option to confirm the resolution of the HTTP Error 400, which is a sensible step to ensure the fix is effective. The only reason the RESPONSE does not score a 10 is that it includes a list of code snippets to check, which are not relevant to the issue at hand. However, the main instructions for fixing the issue are accurate and align with the git diff, so the score is a 9.",
