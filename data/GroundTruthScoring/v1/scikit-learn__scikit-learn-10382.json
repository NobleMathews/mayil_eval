    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section nor does it align with the git diff provided. The ISSUE describes a problem with the TfidfVectorizer's dtype argument being ignored, and a secondary issue with improving the error message in the FitFailedWarning. The RESPONSE, however, provides generic advice that is not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. It suggests updating the TfidfVectorizer class and the *SearchCV classes without specific guidance on how to address the dtype issue or the error message improvement. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests using the '%r' format specifier, which is contrary to the git diff that replaces '%r' with '%s' and the use of 'format_exception_only'. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant advice about storing full tracebacks in 'cv_results_', which is not part of the git diff or the issue described. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
