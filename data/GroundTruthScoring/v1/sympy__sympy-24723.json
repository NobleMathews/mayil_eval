    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests locating and modifying the `MultivariateNormal` class in the `sympy/stats/joint_rv_types.py` file, which is incorrect as the issue is with the `MatrixNormal` class in the `sympy/stats/matrix_distributions.py` file. The git diff provided shows the necessary changes in the `matrix_distributions.py` file, not the `joint_rv_types.py` file. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. It also incorrectly references the `MultivariateNormal` class and provides links to unrelated code snippets, which would not help the developer fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in resolving the issue and does not match the git diff.",
