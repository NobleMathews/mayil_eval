    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the issue of the ambiguous 'status' column reference and suggests specifying the table alias along with the column name to resolve the ambiguity. This is somewhat relevant to the issue at hand, as it addresses the ambiguity problem. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the Django ORM's query construction code to handle alias collisions in GROUP BY clauses, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the user's query, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and lacks the necessary detail to be considered a helpful solution to the issue described.",
