    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the changes needed to address the issue of adding `genindex`, `modindex`, and `search` to the `toctree` without causing warnings. It suggests modifying the `TocTree` directive to recognize these special references and avoid emitting warnings, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach to handling generated document names differently from other documents.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable code changes that match the git diff. Instead, it offers a general description of what needs to be done without delving into the details of how to implement these changes in the codebase. The git diff, on the other hand, provides precise modifications to the code, including the addition of a set of generated document names and conditional checks to prevent warnings for these documents.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff or the issue at hand, which could potentially lead the developer astray. While the RESPONSE is on the right track by recognizing the need to handle special documents differently, it lacks the actionable and detailed guidance present in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 3 for being somewhat relevant but not offering the level of detail and specificity needed to assist the developer effectively.",
