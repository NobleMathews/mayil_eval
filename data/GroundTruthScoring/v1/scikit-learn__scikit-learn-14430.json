    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the use of the `pickle` module with `cloudpickle` or `dill` to serialize objects containing `lambda` expressions. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution implemented in the codebase was to refactor the code to remove the use of `lambda` expressions, thus making the objects serializable with the standard `pickle` module. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the implemented solution. Instead, it suggests a workaround that does not address the root cause of the issue, which is the use of `lambda` expressions that are not serializable by `pickle`. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff. Therefore, it should receive a score of 0.",
