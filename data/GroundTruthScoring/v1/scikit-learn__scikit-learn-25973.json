    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis and actionable steps that are highly relevant to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to use `check_cv` to convert the `cv` parameter into a cross-validator object, which is in line with the git diff's addition of `cv = check_cv(self.cv, y, classifier=is_classifier(self.estimator))` in the `fit` method. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that `LeaveOneGroupOut`'s `split` method returns correct splits and that `SequentialFeatureSelector` iterates over the splits properly, which is relevant to the issue but not directly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE further advises on handling indices from the splits when accessing elements in `X` and `y`, which is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff but is a valid concern when dealing with cross-validation splits. Lastly, the RESPONSE suggests checking the score aggregation function for error handling, which is not part of the git diff but is a reasonable step to take when debugging the `IndexError` described in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly replicate the git diff changes but offers a comprehensive approach to resolving the issue, including the use of `check_cv` as seen in the git diff. It also provides additional troubleshooting steps that could be valuable in diagnosing and fixing the problem, even though they are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to the `_get_best_new_feature_score` method, which are part of the git diff, but it does address the broader context of the issue with cross-validation splits. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance, guidance, and alignment with the git diff, while acknowledging that it does not include all specific changes from the git diff.",
