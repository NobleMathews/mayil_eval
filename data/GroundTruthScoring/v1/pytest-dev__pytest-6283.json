    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue of log duplication due to a logging call within a `@pytest.mark.skipif` condition. The RESPONSE suggests generic troubleshooting steps such as checking the logging configuration and the implementation of the functions, which are not directly related to the issue. It also suggests using a fixture to configure logging or disabling log capturing as a workaround, which does not solve the underlying problem. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of a dummy handler to prevent the `logging.basicConfig()` call, which is the solution presented in the git diff. The only slightly relevant part of the RESPONSE is the suggestion to investigate if pytest's log capturing mechanism is interacting with the logging module unexpectedly, which is somewhat related to the issue but does not provide a clear solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 1 for being somewhat relevant but lacking actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
