    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `RadioSelect` widget rendering a blank option even though `blank=False` is set on the `ForeignKey` field. The solution proposed in the RESPONSE involves modifying the `TestRun` model to set `null=False` and overriding the `__init__` method of `TestRunForm` to set the `choices` attribute of the `data_file` field's widget to exclude the blank option.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `TestRun` model, nor does it suggest overriding the `__init__` method of `TestRunForm`. Instead, the git diff modifies the `formfield` method in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to pass the `blank` attribute to the form field, and it adjusts the logic in `django/forms/models.py` to handle the `empty_label` based on the `blank` attribute and the type of widget used.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which is to handle the `empty_label` within the Django framework's form field logic rather than in the user-defined form or model. The RESPONSE's solution is a workaround that might work but does not address the issue at the framework level as the git diff does. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers an alternative approach that is not as effective as the changes shown in the git diff.",
