    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting a review of the `bulk_update` method and ensuring that `F` expressions are resolved correctly. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the `bulk_update` method to handle `F` expressions by calling `resolve_expression`. However, the RESPONSE suggests an alternative approach that involves modifying the loop that iterates over the objects and fields, which is different from the git diff's approach of modifying the type check condition. The RESPONSE's example fix does not align with the git diff, which simply changes the type check from `isinstance(attr, Expression)` to `not hasattr(attr, 'resolve_expression')`. The RESPONSE's approach could be a valid alternative, but it is more complex and not as concise as the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that may be helpful for understanding the context but do not directly contribute to the solution. Overall, the RESPONSE offers a partially relevant solution with some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
