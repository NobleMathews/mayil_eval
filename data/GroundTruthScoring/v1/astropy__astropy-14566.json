    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `TimeDecimalYear.set_jds` method to handle `MaskedColumn` inputs, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff does not modify the `set_jds` method but instead adds a check for Quantity inputs in various time formats and refactors some comments and documentation strings. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `_check_val_type_not_quantity` function or the handling of Quantity inputs with time units.\n\nThe RESPONSE does identify that there is an issue with the `Time` class when using `format='decimalyear'` with `MaskedColumn` data, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE's suggestion to handle `MaskedColumn` by checking if `val1` and `val2` are instances of `MaskedColumn` does not reflect the changes in the git diff and does not address the specific problem described in the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff and does not effectively address the issue described.",
