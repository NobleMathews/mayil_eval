    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the regular expression `_re_polynomial` to include 'R', 'RR', 'C', and 'CC', which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on how to handle the splitting of variable names, which is a necessary step for the `preprocess` method to work correctly with the updated regular expression. This matches the git diff's approach of adding separate cases for 'R', 'RR', and 'C', 'CC' in the `preprocess` method. The RESPONSE does not include the exact code changes for handling 'R', 'RR', 'C', 'CC' as separate cases in the `preprocess` method, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that variable names are split correctly is a valuable addition to the solution and aligns with the git diff's intent to handle these domains properly.",
