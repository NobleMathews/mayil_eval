    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_or_set` method to use `self.has_key` to check if the key exists before setting it, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff introduces a sentinel value `_missing_key` to differentiate between a cache miss and a stored `None` value, which is a more nuanced approach than simply checking if the key exists. The RESPONSE's suggestion to remove the check for `val is self._missing_key` and replace it with `self.has_key` does not align with the git diff and would not solve the issue as effectively. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to other methods such as `get_many`, `incr`, and `incr_version`, which also use the `_missing_key` sentinel. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes an update to an `aget_or_set` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff, and it is unclear if this method exists or is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to update test cases, but overall, it does not provide a solution that is as effective as the one in the git diff.",
