    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which specifically changes the exception caught from OSError to UnreadablePostError in the CSRF middleware to handle a broken connection before POST data is fully read. Instead, the RESPONSE provides general advice on CSRF settings and file upload configurations, which are not directly related to the issue of incorrect CSRF failure reporting due to a problem with storage. The RESPONSE does mention checking the existence of the FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR directory and ensuring that the filesystem storage implementation handles missing directories appropriately, which is somewhat related to the issue. However, it does not address the core problem of the incorrect exception being caught, as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not actionable or relevant enough to the specific issue and does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative.",
