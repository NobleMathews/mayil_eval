    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the tutorial documentation to reflect the correct tree structure for `x**2`, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It also correctly identifies the need to review and correct the `dotprint` function implementation to ensure the correct order of operands in the `Pow` function. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement the changes in the code, which is a significant part of the git diff. The git diff includes specific code modifications to the `purestr` function and related functions in `dot.py`, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to checking the `_print_Pow` method in the pretty printer, which is not relevant to the dot printer issue described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, so it should receive a score between 1 and 3. Given that it does address the issue at a high level but misses the specific code changes and includes an irrelevant reference, a score of 3 is appropriate.",
