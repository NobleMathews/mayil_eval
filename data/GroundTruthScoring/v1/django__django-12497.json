    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the error message hints in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to suggest the use of `ManyToManyField` instead of `ForeignKey`, which is in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly advises against using `symmetrical=False` as an argument for `ForeignKey`, which is consistent with the git diff and the issue description. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the error message for checks with IDs \"fields.E334\" and \"fields.E335\" to include the correct hint, which is a valid and relevant suggestion. However, the RESPONSE goes beyond the git diff by providing additional guidance on reviewing other methods and ensuring the correct setup of `ManyToManyField`, which, while potentially useful, is not directly related to the specific issue described. This additional advice does not detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE, as it could help prevent related issues in the future. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its high relevance and clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
