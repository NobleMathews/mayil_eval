    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests two main actions: updating the `ordering` attribute in the `Meta` class of the `Book` model to use strings instead of query expressions, and modifying the warning message in the `as_sql` method to correctly format the `.order_by()` method call. The first suggestion does not align with the git diff, which does not modify the `Book` model but instead changes the way the warning message is formatted to handle query expressions properly. The second suggestion partially aligns with the git diff, as it also aims to modify the warning message. However, the RESPONSE's proposed code change does not match the git diff's approach of using `repr(f)` for each field in `_meta_ordering` to ensure correct formatting. Instead, it suggests a string replacement method that is not present in the git diff and may not handle complex query expressions correctly. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a significant amount of information about checking various code snippets, which, while related to the issue, do not provide direct actionable guidance to resolve the issue as described in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
