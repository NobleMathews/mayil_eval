    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely matches the git diff. It suggests checking if the '_transformers' attribute is empty before attempting to unpack it, which aligns with the git diff's approach of checking if 'items' is empty before unpacking. The RESPONSE also modifies the '_set_params' method to handle the case when 'items' is an empty list, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of a conditional check and the creation of an empty 'names' list when 'items' is empty.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is very similar to the git diff, with the addition of a context manager 'with suppress(TypeError):' which is not present in the git diff. This context manager is not necessary for the fix, but it does not detract from the effectiveness of the solution. The RESPONSE also includes a modification to the '_transformers' property in 'sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py', which is not part of the git diff but is a reasonable suggestion to ensure that the property can handle an empty list of transformers.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that is highly relevant and closely matches the git diff. It offers a clear solution to the issue and includes additional considerations that are relevant to the context of the problem. The RESPONSE does not directly align with every aspect of the git diff, as it includes an unnecessary context manager and addresses a related file not mentioned in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
