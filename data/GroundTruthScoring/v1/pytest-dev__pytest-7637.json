    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to reintroducing warnings by suggesting to review the pull request that suppressed the warnings and revert those changes. However, it lacks specific actionable steps that align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests looking for 'warnings.filterwarnings' calls, which is not relevant to the git diff, as the actual changes involve uncommenting existing warning calls and adding a decorator with a warning parameter. The RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code example that does not match the git diff and is not applicable to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not provide the correct guidance on how to reintroduce the warnings as shown in the git diff, which involves specific modifications to the codebase. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the topic of reintroducing warnings, but it fails to provide actionable and accurate steps that would lead to the resolution of the issue as per the git diff.",
