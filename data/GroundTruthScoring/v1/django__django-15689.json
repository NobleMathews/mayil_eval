    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and optimizing the `should_redirect_with_slash` method, considering subclassing `CommonMiddleware`, and testing changes for performance improvements. It also mentions compatibility with specific Django versions and the use of the `no_append_slash` decorator. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of reducing latency caused by `APPEND_SLASH`, they do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a specific change in the `process_request` method to handle the redirect more efficiently, combining the `PREPEND_WWW` and `should_redirect_with_slash` checks into a single redirect when necessary. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `process_request` method or combining checks to reduce the number of redirects, which is the core of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a clear, alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff.",
