    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue of the VotingClassifier failing when an estimator is set to None and sample_weight is used. It suggests modifying the fit method to skip fitting any estimators that are set to None and to handle None values appropriately in other methods. This aligns with the git diff, which adds a check to continue past None estimators when sample_weight is not None. The RESPONSE goes further by suggesting modifications to the fit method and handling of the estimators_ attribute, which is not explicitly covered in the git diff but is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet demonstrating the changes, which is helpful for implementation. However, the RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's approach of adding a simple check within the existing loop. Instead, it suggests a broader refactoring of the fit method and handling of the estimators_ attribute. This broader approach is still relevant and could prevent similar issues in the future, but it is not as concise as the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a highly relevant and clear solution that aligns with the git diff's intent but suggests a more extensive change than the git diff itself.",
