    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement support for `@functools.singledispatch` functions in Sphinx documentation, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to solving the problem. The git diff shows that new classes for singledispatch function and method documenters are added, along with utility functions to check for singledispatch functions and methods. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying the `PyFunction` class and does not mention the creation of new documenter classes or the utility functions shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes pseudo-code that does not reflect the changes made in the git diff and suggests modifying files and classes that are not part of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes required to address the ISSUE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's solution. It does not provide the specific guidance needed to implement the changes shown in the git diff.",
