    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `resolve_expression` method in the `FilteredRelation` class to ensure that the necessary JOINs are added when a `Coalesce` function is used in a condition. This suggestion is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which indeed modifies the `resolve_expression` method, but the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable changes that match the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE correctly identifies that the issue is related to `FilteredRelation` and `Coalesce` and that the JOINs are not being added correctly. However, it does not provide the detailed changes to the `FilteredRelation` class, such as the introduction of `resolved_condition` and the specific logic for cloning and relabeling conditions, which are present in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests setting the `allow_joins` parameter to `True`, which is consistent with the git diff, but it lacks the depth of changes made in the git diff, such as handling the `relabeled_clone` and the adjustments to the `join` method in `query.py`.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is on the right track by focusing on the `resolve_expression` method but fails to provide the detailed and specific changes that are necessary to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff.",
