    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to deprecate `n_iter` in favor of `max_iter` for the `BayesianRidge` and `ARDRegression` classes, which is the issue at hand. It includes instructions for updating the constructor, adding a deprecation warning, updating documentation, replacing internal uses of `n_iter`, and ensuring the `n_iter_` attribute remains unchanged. The provided code snippet for the constructor and deprecation warning is in line with the changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding a test case to check for the deprecation warning, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the import of the `warnings` module, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to keep the `n_iter_` attribute unchanged, which aligns with the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides nearly all the necessary information to resolve the issue effectively.",
