    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue of Pylint not respecting ignore settings in recursive mode. It correctly identifies the need to review and potentially fix the logic in the `_is_ignored_file` function within `pylint/lint/expand_modules.py`, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests verifying that the ignore rules are applied correctly and testing the changes, which is a good practice for ensuring the fix is effective.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `_is_ignored_file` function and the modification of the `_discover_files` method in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`. It also includes a suggestion to check if the default ignore pattern `r\"^.#\"` is being applied correctly, which is not directly related to the git diff or the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may not be necessary for resolving the issue, as the git diff already outlines the required changes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is relevant and provides actionable advice that aligns with the git diff, but it is not as specific or complete as it could be. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
