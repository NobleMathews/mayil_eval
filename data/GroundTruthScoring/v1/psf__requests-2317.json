    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the issue with the handling of binary strings in the 'requests' library. It suggests modifications to the `to_native_string` function to correctly handle binary strings, which aligns with the git diff's approach of replacing `builtin_str` with `to_native_string`. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises checking the usage of `method` in `requests/sessions.py` and decoding it if necessary, which is also in line with the git diff's change. However, the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions that are not present in the git diff, such as modifying `safe_encode_list` and ensuring that `method` is a native string in various places. While these suggestions are relevant and could potentially improve the handling of the `method` variable, they are not reflected in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not a perfect match but still offers a highly relevant and actionable solution to the issue.",
