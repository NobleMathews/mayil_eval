    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `mod_inverse` function to handle negative modulo `m` correctly, which aligns with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE's suggestion to replace the condition `if m != 1 and m != -1:` with `if abs(m) != 1:` is a valid alternative to the git diff's approach of changing the condition to `if m != 1 and m != -1:`. Both changes aim to allow for negative values of `m` and are effectively equivalent in this context.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises adjusting the assignment of `c` to ensure it has the same sign as `m` by using the `symmetric_residue` function. This is a different approach from the git diff, which simply uses `x % m` and removes the additional adjustment for when `a < 0`. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion is a valid alternative that would achieve the same goal of ensuring `c` has the correct sign relative to `m`. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the removal of the `if a < 0: c -= m` condition, but the use of `symmetric_residue` would implicitly handle this.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly address the change in the comment from `c has the same sign as a` to `c has the same sign as m`, which is a minor discrepancy from the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE provides additional context by referencing code snippets and the `symmetric_residue` function, which adds value for the developer in understanding where the changes should be made and why. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes but gives a clear direction that is in line with the git diff's intent and the issue's requirements.",
