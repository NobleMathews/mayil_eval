    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a proxy object to mimic the behavior of a QuerySet and overriding the all() method to return this proxy object. This approach is conceptually aligned with the goal of lazily creating related querysets to improve the performance of prefetch_related. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows changes to the _apply_rel_filters method in related_descriptors.py and modifications to the QuerySet class in query.py, including the addition of a _defer_next_filter flag and a _deferred_filter tuple to defer the application of filters. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the introduction of these flags and tuples. Instead, it provides a high-level overview of an alternative solution that does not directly address the changes shown in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue of improving prefetch_related performance, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the specific changes required. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
