    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a viable alternative to the issue described. The git diff shows a modification in the `TRmorrie` function within the `fu.py` file, specifically adding an argument to the `f` function and handling the numerator and denominator separately. The RESPONSE, however, suggests reviewing and updating pattern matching rules in the `trigsimp` module, which is not related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides incorrect file paths and line numbers, which are not relevant to the issue or the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable steps that would lead to resolving the issue as the git diff does. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful or misguided in assisting a developer to fix the issue in the software repository.",
