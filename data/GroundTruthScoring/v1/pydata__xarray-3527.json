    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps to implement the `quantile` method in the `DatasetGroupBy` class, which is the core issue described. It correctly identifies the need to follow the pattern used in the `DataArrayGroupBy.quantile` method and suggests handling similar parameters. The RESPONSE also recommends using the `apply_ufunc` function to apply the numpy `quantile` or `nanquantile` function, which is a reasonable approach for applying operations across grouped datasets. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding tests to verify the implementation, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the exact implementation details, such as the specific interpolation methods and the handling of the `keep_attrs` parameter. The git diff shows that the `quantile` method is implemented by directly calling the `map` method on the groupby object, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Despite this, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use `apply_ufunc` could still be a viable alternative to the approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant sections of code but are not necessary for fixing the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, but it does not match every aspect of the git diff's approach.",
