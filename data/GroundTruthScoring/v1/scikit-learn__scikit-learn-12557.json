    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `predict` method in `sklearn/svm/_base.py` to use the same tie-breaking strategy as `_ovr_decision_function` from `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes were made in `sklearn/svm/base.py` and `sklearn/svm/classes.py`, where the `break_ties` parameter was added to the `SVC` and `NuSVC` classes, and the `predict` method was updated to handle tie-breaking when `break_ties=True` and `decision_function_shape='ovr'`. The RESPONSE does not mention adding the `break_ties` parameter or modifying the `NuSVC` class, which are key aspects of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `_ovr_decision_function`, which is not mentioned in the git diff, and it does not provide a complete solution to the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need for consistent tie-breaking between `decision_function` and `predict`, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the changes required to resolve the issue.",
