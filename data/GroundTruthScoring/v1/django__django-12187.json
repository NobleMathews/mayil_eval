    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a method to configure where to save the staticfiles manifest, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the ManifestFilesMixin class to accept a new parameter 'manifest_storage' and uses it within the class methods. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests adding a new setting 'STATICFILES_MANIFEST_DIR' and modifying the class to use this setting, which is a different approach. While the RESPONSE's approach could be a viable alternative, it does not provide the same level of detail as the git diff, such as the specific changes to the '__init__', 'read_manifest', and 'save_manifest' methods. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to update the documentation, which is not reflected in the git diff but is a good practice. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content that closely matches the git diff, hence the score of 3.",
