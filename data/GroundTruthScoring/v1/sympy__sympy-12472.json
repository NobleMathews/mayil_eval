{
    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue lies within the `sqrt` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` and that the solution should involve modifying this function to handle complex numbers correctly. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the `sqrt` function or the `complexes.py` file. Instead, the git diff shows modifications in multiple other files such as `add.py`, `expr.py`, `mul.py`, `power.py`, and `radsimp.py`, indicating that the issue is addressed through a broader set of changes across different parts of the SymPy library.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, as it focuses on a specific function and file that are not part of the actual changes made. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance or code changes that would help resolve the issue described. It also incorrectly directs attention to code snippets that are not relevant to the fix, as evidenced by the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff and fails to assist developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff. Based on these observations, the RESPONSE scores a 0.",
