    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `copy_X` parameter from the `fit` method signature entirely and using `self.copy_X` directly. However, the git diff indicates that the `copy_X` parameter should remain in the `fit` method signature but with a default value of `None`. The git diff also includes logic to check if `copy_X` is `None` and, if so, to use `self.copy_X` instead. The RESPONSE does not include this check and therefore does not address the issue of potentially contradicting values for `copy_X` as described in the ISSUE. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any code changes that would allow `copy_X` to be overridden if explicitly passed to the `fit` method, which is a key part of the solution proposed in the git diff.",
