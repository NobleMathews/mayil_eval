    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a 'set_paths' method to the 'ContourSet' class, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the '_paths' attribute and mark the 'ContourSet' as stale. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to the file 'lib/matplotlib/contour.py' for the 'ContourSet' class definition, while the git diff shows that the changes should be made in 'lib/matplotlib/collections.py'. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a detailed explanation and a code snippet, which is helpful, but it does not match the git diff in terms of the exact location and context of the changes. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but is incomplete and partially relevant due to the incorrect file reference. Therefore, it scores a 4.",
