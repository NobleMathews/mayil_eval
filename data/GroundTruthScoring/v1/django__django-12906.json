{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive solution to the issue, including the addition of a system check, updates to documentation, and identification of affected features. It aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the addition of a system check in the 'django/contrib/admin/checks.py' file, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that a warning should be issued, which matches the git diff's introduction of a warning (admin.W411). The RESPONSE goes further by suggesting updates to the release notes and admin documentation, which is part of the issue's request but not covered by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the warning ID (admin.W412 in the RESPONSE vs. admin.W411 in the git diff) and the exact implementation details of the check function, but these are minor discrepancies that do not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to document the exact rendering features affected is also valuable, although not directly related to the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, justifying a score of 9.",
