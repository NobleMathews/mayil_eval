    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a docstring to the `__init__` method of the `MyDerived` class to resolve the \"Unexpected indentation\" warning. However, this suggestion does not align with the git diff provided, which makes changes to the Sphinx autodoc extension to handle inherited docstrings correctly. The RESPONSE fails to address the underlying issue of Sphinx generating warnings when derived classes with overloaded constructors have no docstrings. The git diff shows modifications to the `get_doc` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` and the `getdoc` function in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` to improve the handling of inherited docstrings, which is the core of the issue described. The RESPONSE does not offer any insights or actionable advice that would help developers locate and fix the issue warranting the diff. Therefore, it does not provide any value in the context of the git diff and the issue described.",
