    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__eq__` method and the `__getattr__` method in the `DataArray` class to handle the absence of the 'units' attribute. However, the git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by adding `.copy()` to the `new_variables[name]` assignment in two places within the `alignment.py` file. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of ensuring that the variables are copied instead of being directly assigned, which would prevent the original `DataArray` from being mutated during the comparison.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the `DataArray.attrs` dictionary being mutated, which is what the git diff aims to resolve. Instead, it focuses on handling the absence of the 'units' attribute, which is not the problem described in the issue. The issue is about the `attrs` being emptied, not just the 'units' attribute being absent.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does provide some general advice on how to handle missing attributes, it does not offer a solution that would prevent the `attrs` dictionary from being mutated, which is the main problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses attribute handling in `DataArray`, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the specific issue described.",
