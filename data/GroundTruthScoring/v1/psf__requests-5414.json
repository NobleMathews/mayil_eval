    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an `except UnicodeError` block to catch the `UnicodeError` and raise `InvalidURL` with an appropriate error message. This is a reasonable approach to handle the issue described, which is to prevent a `UnicodeError` when accessing a URL with an invalid label and instead raise an `InvalidURL` exception. However, the git diff provided shows a different approach to solving the issue. The git diff modifies the condition to check for a host starting with either a '*' or a '.' and raises the `InvalidURL` exception directly without catching a `UnicodeError`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the condition but instead suggests catching the exception after it occurs. While the RESPONSE's approach could be considered a valid alternative, it does not match the git diff's preventative strategy and may not be as efficient since it involves handling an exception after it has been raised. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not closely match the git diff and is incomplete in terms of aligning with the provided solution.",
