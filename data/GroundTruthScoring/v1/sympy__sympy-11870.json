    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to use SymPy's `rewrite` method to express exponentials in terms of trigonometric functions and then simplify them. This is relevant to the ISSUE, which is about simplifying expressions to yield trigonometric identities. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the use of `sinc(k)` for the second expression, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of a rewrite rule for `sinc`. However, the RESPONSE does not address the need for a conditional expression to handle the case when `k` is zero, which is a key part of the git diff. The git diff introduces a `Piecewise` function to handle the division by zero case for `sin(k)/k`, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track and provides some useful information, it is incomplete and does not fully align with the git diff's approach to the issue. This warrants a score of 4.",
