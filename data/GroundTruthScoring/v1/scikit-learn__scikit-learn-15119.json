{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a solution to the issue described. It acknowledges the inconsistency between the `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` methods of `FeatureUnion` but fails to offer any actionable guidance or solution. The RESPONSE incorrectly states that the `fit` method accepts `**fit_params`, which contradicts the git diff that shows the `fit` method being modified to include `**fit_params`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests that the `transform` method should be changed to accept `**fit_params`, which is not supported by the git diff and is not relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows the addition of `**fit_params` to the `fit` method and the passing of `fit_params` to the `_parallel_func` call within the `fit` method. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in discussing the inconsistency issue but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, therefore it receives a score of 2.",
