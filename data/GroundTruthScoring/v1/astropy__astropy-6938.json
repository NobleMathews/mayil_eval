    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `replace` method not modifying `output_field` in-place and suggests assigning the result back to `output_field`. This aligns with the git diff's approach of assigning the modified `output_field` back to itself to ensure the changes take effect. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `output_field = output_field.replace(...)`, which is not exactly the same as the git diff's `output_field[:] = output_field.replace(...)`. The git diff's use of slicing with `[:]` is a more precise way to ensure that the array is modified in-place. While the RESPONSE's solution would work, it is not as accurate as the git diff's solution, which is why the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would lead to a similar result as the git diff, hence it is scored a 7.",
