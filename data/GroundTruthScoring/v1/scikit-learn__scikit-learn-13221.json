    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides clear and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to locate the function where `gamma` is computed when `gamma='scale'` is set in the `SVC` class and suggests replacing the calculation of `gamma` from using the standard deviation to using the variance. This change is consistent with the git diff, which shows the replacement of `X.std()` with `X.var()` in multiple places within the `SVC`, `NuSVC`, `SVR`, `NuSVR`, and `OneClassSVM` classes. The RESPONSE also correctly advises ensuring that the change is made in both the `SVC` class and any other relevant utility functions or classes, which is in line with the git diff that shows changes in multiple classes. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests verifying that the change is consistent with the RBF kernel definition and the empirical evidence provided, which is a prudent step to ensure the correctness of the change. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the specific lines or files to be changed, but it does provide a general direction and the rationale behind the changes, which is why it receives a score of 9 instead of a perfect 10.",
