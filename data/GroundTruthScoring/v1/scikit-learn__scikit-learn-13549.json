    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `resample` function to include stratified subsampling by using `StratifiedShuffleSplit` and handling edge cases where the number of requested samples is equal to or close to the number of samples in `X`. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which has already implemented stratified resampling within the `resample` function without using `StratifiedShuffleSplit`. The git diff shows that the `_approximate_mode` function has been moved from `_split.py` to `__init__.py` and is being used directly within the `resample` function to handle stratification. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the changes made in the git diff and suggests an alternative that is not only different but also less efficient and more complex than the solution in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
