    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance on how to add missing mathematical operations to the `_mathtext_data.py` file in the Matplotlib library, which is relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE suggests updating the `tex2uni` dictionary with new mappings, ensuring that the Unicode characters are mapped to the correct LaTeX commands, and verifying that the characters are part of the standard LaTeX commands or from the AMS package. It also provides an example of how to add new entries to the dictionary, which is actionable and helpful. However, the RESPONSE does not include the specific Unicode and LaTeX command pairs that were added in the git diff, which would have been necessary to fully align with the git diff provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a clear, actionable guide for adding missing mathematical operations to the Matplotlib library. It correctly identifies the need to update the `tex2uni` dictionary and provides an example of how to do so. However, it does not include the specific Unicode and LaTeX command pairs that were added in the git diff, such as 'increment', 'smallin', 'notsmallowns', etc. Instead, it uses placeholders like '\\triangle' and '\\in', which are not directly aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE also does not remove the 'leftangle' and 'rightangle' entries, which were removed in the git diff. Despite these discrepancies, the RESPONSE is still valuable and would assist a developer in addressing the issue, albeit not perfectly aligned with the git diff.",
