    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described, which involves implementing logic to ensure that certain comparisons with the ceiling and floor functions return the expected boolean values. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests that there is no specific bug or problem with the ceiling and floor functions, which contradicts the git diff that provides a detailed implementation to fix the issue. The RESPONSE also fails to provide any actionable guidance or meaningful information that would aid in resolving the issue. It does not offer any insights into the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of _eval_is_negative, _eval_is_nonnegative, and comparison operator methods for the ceiling and floor functions. The RESPONSE's suggestion to look at the actual implementation of these functions and provide a test case if there is an error does not align with the git diff, which already contains the necessary changes to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and misguided, offering no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
