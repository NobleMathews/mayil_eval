    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests checking if the `args` tuple is not empty before accessing its first element, which aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the IndexError. The RESPONSE also includes an alternative to handle the case where `args` is empty, which is a valid and effective solution to prevent the error from occurring. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests adding an else clause to return False when `args` is empty, while the git diff simplifies the conditional statement and returns the result of `endswith` directly. However, the RESPONSE's solution is still a viable alternative that would prevent the IndexError and is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE loses points for including irrelevant code snippet checks that do not contribute to solving the issue.",
