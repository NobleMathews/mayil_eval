    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a `_cachedRenderer` attribute and a `get_renderer` method to the `SubFigure` class, which aligns with the git diff's addition of a `_cachedRenderer` property to the `SubFigure` class. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `clabel` method in `ContourSet` should use the `get_renderer` method to obtain the renderer, which is in line with the git diff's intent to ensure that the `SubFigure` class has the necessary attributes to avoid the AttributeError.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's approach of using properties with getters and setters, instead suggesting the addition of an attribute and a method. While this is a viable alternative, it is not a direct match to the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes needed, which would have been helpful for the developer to implement the solution directly.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant for further investigation or testing, which is useful but not directly related to the fix itself. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and alignment with the git diff's approach, but it is not a perfect match.",
