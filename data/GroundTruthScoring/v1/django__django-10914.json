    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described, which is setting the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to 0o644 in Django's global settings.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions, such as adding a warning to the documentation, reporting the issue, modifying the FileSystemStorage class, checking the implementation of TemporaryUploadedFile, reviewing the use of tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile and os.rename, and potentially creating a custom file upload handler. However, these suggestions do not directly address the specific issue of setting the default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS to 0o644, which is what the git diff does. The RESPONSE does mention ensuring FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS is explicitly configured in settings.py, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff, but it does not provide the specific change needed (which is setting the default to 0o644). The RESPONSE also provides code snippets to check, but these are more related to understanding the context rather than fixing the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
