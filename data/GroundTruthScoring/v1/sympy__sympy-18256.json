    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_print_Pow` method to handle superscripted symbols without parentheses, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which involves adding a new setting `parenthesize_super` to control the behavior and modifying the `parenthesize_super` method to conditionally add parentheses based on this setting. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a new helper method `_is_superscripted_symbol`, which is not present in the git diff and is not necessary given the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE does not mention the new setting or the changes to the `parenthesize_super` method, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and misses the introduction of a new configurable setting that is central to the git diff's solution.",
