    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to substituting a matrix for a scalar and provides a general solution involving modifications to the `subs` method and the `Add` and `Mul` operations in the matrix expressions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically addresses the issue by modifying the `flatten` methods in `sympy/core/add.py` and `sympy/core/mul.py` to handle matrix expressions correctly when adding or multiplying with zero.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests modifying different files (`sympy/matrices/common.py`, `sympy/matrices/expressions/matadd.py`, and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matmul.py`) and does not mention the `flatten` method or the changes made to it in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to add tests, which is not reflected in the git diff but is a good practice in general.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of matrix substitution in expressions, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the specific changes made in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score for not closely matching the git diff's approach to the issue.",
