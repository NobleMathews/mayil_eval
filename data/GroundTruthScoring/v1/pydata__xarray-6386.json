    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the problem, identifying that the issue is related to the `_overwrite_indexes` method being called with an unexpected keyword argument `variables`. It correctly identifies that the problem is within the `map` method after resampling a dataset and suggests checking the signature of the `_overwrite_indexes` method in both `Dataset` and `DataArray` classes. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or code change that would resolve the issue. Instead, it offers a high-level approach to resolving the issue, such as updating the `_overwrite_indexes` method to include the `variables` argument or adjusting the calling code. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff, which shows a specific change where the `variables` keyword argument is replaced with `index_vars` as a positional argument. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be related to the issue, but these are not directly actionable and do not provide a clear path to resolution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a direction for investigation but lacks the actionable content and specificity found in the git diff.",
