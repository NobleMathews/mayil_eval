    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `builtin_resolver` function and adding a check for `Literal` values in the `istyping` function within `builtin_resolver`. However, the git diff provided does not modify the `builtin_resolver` function or the `istyping` function. Instead, the git diff modifies the `unparse` function to handle `Literal` values correctly by wrapping the Text nodes inside brackets by a literal node if the subscript is a `Literal` and adjusting the handling of `nodes.Text` and `nodes.literal` nodes.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. It suggests a different part of the code to be modified and a different strategy for handling `Literal` values. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to handle `Literal` values might be a valid approach, it does not match the git diff's solution and does not provide a clear, actionable solution that would resolve the issue as the git diff does.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some relevant information by pointing out the parts of the code that could be related to the issue, but it fails to offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
