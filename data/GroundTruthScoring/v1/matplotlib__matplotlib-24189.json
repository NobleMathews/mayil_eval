    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the width_ratios to match the number of top-level columns in the mosaic, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the code has been updated to clarify that width_ratios and height_ratios only apply to the outer layout and that gridspec_kw should not be passed to nested layouts. Additionally, the git diff includes changes to the documentation and the implementation to handle nested layouts correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the documentation updates and the removal of gridspec_kw from the nested layout call. Instead, it suggests a workaround by changing the width_ratios parameter, which does not resolve the underlying issue of the function's handling of nested mosaics.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about the nature of the issue and the function's expectations regarding width_ratios. However, it fails to offer a solution that aligns with the changes made in the git diff or addresses the core problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
