    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file, which aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. It also correctly identifies the need for sorting imports according to Django's coding style and isort's default behavior. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the specific implementation details that are present in the git diff, such as the lambda function used for sorting and the tuple that prioritizes 'from' imports. Instead, it suggests implementing a custom sorting function or adjusting an existing one, which is a viable alternative but not as precise as the git diff. The RESPONSE also unnecessarily suggests configuring isort settings or creating a `.isort.cfg` file, which is not part of the git diff and is not required to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not closely match the git diff's implementation, resulting in a score of 4.",
