    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described, nor does it align with the git diff. The suggestions given, such as removing the `x` kwarg, adjusting `constrained_layout` parameters, updating Matplotlib, or manually adjusting the position of the subfigures, do not address the specific problem of the subfigure position shifting on the y-axis when the `x` kwarg is added to `supxlabel`. The git diff shows a specific change in the code to conditionally set `autopos` based on whether `y` is `None` for `_supxlabel` and `_suptitle`, or if `x` is `None` for `_supylabel`. This targeted fix is not reflected in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not offer actionable guidance on how to use these snippets to resolve the problem. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue and suggests general troubleshooting steps, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
