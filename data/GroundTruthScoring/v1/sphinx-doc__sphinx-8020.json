    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the type hint syntax in the docstring to match Python 3.8+ style and removing the inner brackets from the type hint. While this might be a valid suggestion for a different context, it does not align with the git diff provided, which makes changes to the Sphinx Python domain handling to support the syntax used in the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the underlying problem in Sphinx's handling of the type hints, which is what the git diff aims to fix. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead the developer to investigate unrelated parts of the Sphinx codebase. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the warning issue but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
