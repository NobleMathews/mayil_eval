{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests updating the condition to check for the address \"0\" and setting the `addr` variable to \"0.0.0.0\" when the input is \"0\", which aligns with the git diff's approach to handle the address formatting. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the output message to reflect the correct address, which is consistent with the git diff's changes. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `on_bind` method, which does not exist in the provided git diff. The git diff instead modifies the `inner_run` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes an unnecessary check for \"0.0.0.0\" in the condition, which is not present in the git diff and is not required to resolve the issue. Despite these differences, the RESPONSE's core suggestion to handle the address correctly is in line with the git diff's solution and would achieve a similar result. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and utility in addressing the issue.",
