    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the `json_script` function signature to accept an additional `encoder` parameter and using this parameter when calling `json.dumps`. The RESPONSE also includes the correct defaulting behavior to `DjangoJSONEncoder` if no custom encoder is provided, which matches the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE addresses the need to update the documentation to reflect this change, which is relevant to the issue but not covered by the git diff. The RESPONSE loses one point because it does not include the exact code changes shown in the git diff, such as the specific way the `json.dumps` call is modified and the exact formatting of the code. However, the RESPONSE's guidance is highly relevant and would effectively assist a developer in resolving the issue.",
