    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__init__` and `validate` methods of `MultiValueField` and updating the `compress` method in the subclass `MF`. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of handling required subfields in `MultiValueField`, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `build_widget_attrs` method to handle the 'required' attribute for widgets when `require_all_fields` is False, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `validate` method and update the `compress` method in `MF` is not reflected in the git diff, which focuses on widget attributes rather than validation logic. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable changes to the code, such as specific lines to modify or exact code to add, which makes it less helpful for a developer looking to fix the issue.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
