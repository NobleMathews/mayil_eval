    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the data type to a higher precision before computing the mean and standard deviation and then casting it back to `np.float16` if necessary. This advice is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which introduces a new function `_safe_accumulator_op` to ensure that accumulator functions use at least `float64` for calculations to avoid precision issues. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement this change in the context of the `StandardScaler` class or mention the creation of a new function to handle safe operations, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the `validation.py` file. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, hence the score of 2.",
