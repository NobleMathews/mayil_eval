    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps for the issue of coarse lines after using `set_segments` and `get_segments` methods in matplotlib. However, it does not directly address the core problem identified in the git diff, which is the simplification of path segments during the `get_segments` method call. The git diff shows that the simplification should be explicitly disabled by passing `simplify=False` to the `iter_segments` method to preserve the original detail of the line segments.\n\nThe RESPONSE does mention the possibility of data being unintentionally modified or downsampled and the need to ensure that the manipulation preserves the original resolution and detail of the line segments, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide the specific actionable guidance present in the git diff, such as modifying the `iter_segments` method call.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a section with code snippets to check, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant code. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the precise solution needed to fix the issue, as shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
