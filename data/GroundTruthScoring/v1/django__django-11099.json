    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the regex attribute in both ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator classes to use '\\A' and '\\Z' instead of '^' and '$', which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE provides the correct code changes and even includes additional context by pointing to the relevant code snippets in the repository. The only minor discrepancy is that the RESPONSE suggests using '\\A' at the start of the regex, while the git diff does not include this change. However, this does not affect the correctness of the solution regarding the issue of trailing newlines, as the issue is with the end of the string, not the beginning. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and actionable, closely matching the git diff's approach to the issue.",
