    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions to ensure precision in the `Time` class, such as modifying the `to_value` method, using the `precision` parameter correctly, and reviewing the `set_jds` method. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows that the precision check was moved from the `precision` setter in `core.py` to the `precision` setter in `formats.py`. The RESPONSE does not mention this change or the rationale behind it, which is central to the issue of precision handling in the `Time` class. The RESPONSE also includes a large amount of general advice and links to code snippets that are not directly related to the specific changes shown in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue of precision in time conversions, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
