{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the `--skip-checks` option for management commands in Django, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `BaseCommand` class to accept the new command-line argument and to update the `execute` method to check for the `--skip-checks` option. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests that inherited management commands should respect the new option.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the addition of the `--skip-checks` argument in the `create_parser` method and the modification of the `execute` method to check the `skip_checks` option. However, it does not mention the removal of 'skip_checks' from `base_stealth_options` or the addition of `--skip-checks` to `show_last` in `DjangoHelpFormatter`, which are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes an unnecessary conditional check for `ALL_CHECKS` in the `execute` method, which is not present in the git diff and is not part of the issue description.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes an unnecessary conditional and omits some changes present in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
