    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to achieve the same result.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the logging configuration to include the `%f` specifier for microseconds, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. The git diff shows the creation of a new `DatetimeFormatter` class that overrides the `formatTime` method to handle the `%f` specifier correctly, and the use of this new formatter in the existing `ColoredLevelFormatter` and other relevant places. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests using `logging.basicConfig` and modifying the date format string directly, which is not how the issue is addressed in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the need to handle timezone information or the conversion from `struct_time` to `datetime.datetime`, which are key elements in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the need for sub-second precision but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
