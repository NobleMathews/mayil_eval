    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a tolerance level for floating-point comparisons and using `np.isclose` with a suitable tolerance instead of direct comparison when checking angle limits. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about handling the precision differences in `float32` representation of `pi/2`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which solves the issue by converting the upper limit to the same data type as the angles being checked and then using the negative of this upper limit as the lower limit. The RESPONSE does not offer actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach of ensuring the comparison is made within the same data type. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces a new concept of a tolerance level, which is not present in the git diff and does not directly address the issue of data type consistency. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
