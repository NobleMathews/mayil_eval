{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `FileResponse.set_headers` method to pass `self.block_size` to `wsgi.file_wrapper`, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that the change should be made in the `__call__` method of the `WSGIHandler` class, not in the `set_headers` method of the `FileResponse` class. However, the RESPONSE does correctly identify that `block_size` should be passed to `wsgi.file_wrapper`, which is a part of the solution. The RESPONSE also correctly points out that if `wsgi.file_wrapper` does not accept a `block_size` parameter, it should be updated to do so, which is in line with the git diff's approach of passing `response.block_size` as a second argument to `wsgi.file_wrapper`. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice but is not entirely accurate in terms of where the changes should be made, hence the score of 4.",
