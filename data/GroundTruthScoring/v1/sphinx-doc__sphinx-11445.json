    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It offers general suggestions without specific reference to the code changes needed to resolve the issue. The git diff shows specific changes to the `sphinx/util/rst.py` file, including the removal of an import try-except block for `pass_environment`, the replacement of a regular expression, and the addition of a line number variable in the `prepend_prolog` function. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these changes or the rationale behind them. Instead, it provides a vague recommendation to check the `rst_prolog` setting and modify the `mypackage.rst` file, which does not reflect the actual changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and lacks relevance and specificity, which is why it receives a low score.",
