    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `id_for_label` method in the `BoundWidget` class to return the ID set by `ChoiceWidget.optionsDescription` if it exists, which is in line with the git diff that changes the return statement of the `id_for_label` method to return `self.data['attrs'].get('id')`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that if `self.data['attrs']['id']` is not set, the method should fallback to the existing behavior, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of using the `get` method that would return `None` (or a default value if specified) if the 'id' key is not present in the dictionary. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it includes a conditional check, whereas the git diff uses the `get` method directly. However, the RESPONSE's approach is still a valid alternative that achieves the same result. The RESPONSE also provides references to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for locating the code that needs to be changed. The score is not a perfect 10 because the RESPONSE includes an unnecessary conditional check instead of using the `get` method directly as shown in the git diff.",
