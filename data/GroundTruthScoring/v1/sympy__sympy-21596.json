    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue, suggesting a review of the intersection method for ImageSet with Reals and the contains method for set membership. It correctly identifies that the intersection of S1 and Reals should result in {-1, 1} and that 2 should not be included in the intersection set. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable changes to the code, nor does it align with the git diff's approach of introducing a new helper function `_solution_union` to handle the intersection logic. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the _contains method and the imageset function, which are not directly addressed in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks the actionable content and specificity found in the git diff, thus it scores a 3.",
