    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps, such as checking the `intersphinx_mapping` configuration, verifying the `napoleon` extension configuration, and ensuring that the extension is up to date. It also suggests creating custom event handlers or roles/directives if necessary, and checking the documentation for correct formatting and valid intersphinx targets. However, these suggestions do not align closely with the git diff provided, which shows specific code changes to the `napoleon` extension to handle type preprocessing for `Yields` sections in docstrings. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `napoleon` extension code or implementing a type preprocessing function, which is the core of the git diff solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader context of the issue, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
