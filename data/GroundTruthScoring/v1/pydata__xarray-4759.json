    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting the `coords` parameter in `xr.concat` to \"minimal\" and using `astype` to explicitly convert coordinate variables to the desired dtype before concatenation. It also mentions handling missing values and updating xarray to resolve the issue.\n\nHowever, the git diff indicates that the issue is resolved by modifying the internal xarray code to ensure that string coordinates are not cast to object dtype during various operations such as alignment, concatenation, and updating of datasets. The git diff introduces a new utility function `maybe_coerce_to_str` to handle this casting issue and applies it across several modules where coordinates are manipulated.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the internal xarray code and does not provide any actionable guidance that would lead to the same outcome as the changes in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any value in assisting a developer to fix the issue as described and represented by the git diff.",
