    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the 'napoleon_attr_annotations' configuration and setting 'napoleon_use_ivar' to 'True', which is aligned with the git diff that sets 'napoleon_attr_annotations' to 'True'. However, the RESPONSE does not provide any specific code changes or guidance on how to implement the solution, which is a significant part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests updating Sphinx or manually adjusting the docstrings, which are not part of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant suggestions such as reporting the issue to the Sphinx project and checking code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
