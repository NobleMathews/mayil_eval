    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement a feature to ignore code flanked with double backticks in docstrings or comments. It suggests modifying the `SpellingChecker` class to include a method that strips out code flanked by double backticks before checking for spelling errors, which is aligned with the git diff's approach of adding a `_strip_code_flanked_in_backticks` function.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of a new regular expression `CODE_FLANKED_IN_BACKTICK_REGEX` or the use of this regex in the new method, which is a key part of the git diff. It also does not address the changes made to the `SpellingChecker` class's `open` method, the addition of the `spelling-ignore-comment-directives` configuration option, or the refactoring of existing classes to inherit from `RegExFilter`.\n\nThe RESPONSE does correctly suggest using a regular expression and modifying the `SpellingChecker` class, but it lacks the specific details and changes that are present in the git diff. Therefore, it provides some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
