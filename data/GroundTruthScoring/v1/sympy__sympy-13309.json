{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the piecewise rewriting for the `Min` and `Max` functions in the `sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` file, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests defining `_eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise` methods for both `Min` and `Max` classes and provides a pseudo-code example for the `Max` class, which is similar to the approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to use the `Piecewise` class and the relational operators `GreaterThan` and `LessThan` for `Max` and `Min`, respectively. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises adding tests for the new feature, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, which uses a helper function `_minmax_as_Piecewise` to handle the logic for both `Min` and `Max`. However, the alternative approach provided in the RESPONSE is valid and would achieve the same result. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for providing a highly relevant and actionable alternative approach to the git diff.",
