{
    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that directly aligns with the git diff. It suggests reviewing the commit that introduced the change in behavior for the `mincnt` parameter and identifies the need to modify the `hexbin` function to ensure consistent behavior of `mincnt` regardless of whether `C` is specified. The RESPONSE correctly points out the need to adjust the conditional block where `C` is not `None` and to ensure that the condition `if len(acc) >= mincnt` is properly accounted for, which is exactly what the git diff does by changing `len(acc) > mincnt` to `len(acc) >= mincnt`. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises testing the changes with a dataset where some gridpoints have exactly one datum to confirm that the issue is resolved, which is a good practice for validating the fix. The RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and provides actionable guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
