    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of DeprecationWarning with the latest setuptools due to the use of distutils version classes.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the use of `distutils.version.LooseVersion` with `packaging.version.parse` and updating the `_version_predates` utility function to use `packaging.version.parse` instead of `Version` from `seaborn.external.version`. However, the git diff shows that the correct solution is to replace `distutils.version.LooseVersion` with a custom `Version` class that has been added to `seaborn.external.version`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, as it suggests using `packaging.version.parse`, which is not present in the git diff, and it incorrectly refers to updating a `_version_predates` function that does not exist in the provided git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE instructs to remove any import statements for `LooseVersion` and to import `parse` from `packaging.version`, which is contrary to the git diff that introduces a new `Version` class and uses it for version comparisons. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
