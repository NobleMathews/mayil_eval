    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests searching for instances of `r\"; \\  \"` and `r\", \\  \"` and replacing them with a single space, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff indicates that the correct change is to replace `r\", \\quad \"` with `r\", \\  \"`, not removing the backslash as the RESPONSE suggests. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly includes `r\"; \\  \"`, which is not part of the issue or the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify the file `sympy/printing/latex.py` and the functions `_print_tuple`, `_print_list`, and `_print_dict` where changes should be made, which is somewhat relevant but not entirely accurate since it does not match the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, but these links are not actionable since they point to a non-existent repository and do not contribute to resolving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
