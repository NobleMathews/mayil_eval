    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section. The issue is about the incorrect placement of the `<properties>` tag within the JUnit XML reports generated by pytest, which should be inside `<testsuite>` instead of `<testcase>`. The RESPONSE, however, provides generic advice that does not align with the git diff or the issue. It suggests ensuring that the `<properties>` tag is placed correctly within the `<testcase>` tag, which is the opposite of what the issue describes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippet references and does not offer any actionable guidance or solutions that would help in resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is entirely unhelpful and misguided, offering no accurate guidance or meaningful information to aid in resolving the issue.",
