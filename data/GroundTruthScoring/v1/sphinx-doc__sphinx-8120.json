    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of generic troubleshooting steps for issues related to translations in Sphinx, but it does not address the specific issue described nor does it align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests verifying the `locale_dirs` setting and ensuring `gettext_auto_build` is set to `True`, which are valid steps but do not directly relate to the problem of the custom translations not being used. The RESPONSE also suggests using `msgmerge`, `msgfmt`, and checking for caching issues, which are not mentioned in the git diff and do not seem to be relevant to the issue at hand. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by modifying the `locale_dirs` list initialization in the code and changing the type hint for the `locale_dirs` parameter in the `init` function. The RESPONSE fails to mention any code changes or type hint modifications, which are key to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a low score.",
