    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan for implementing a feature to disable linkcheck anchor checks for specific URLs, which aligns with the issue's request. It suggests adding a new configuration option and modifying the link checking logic, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which introduces a new configuration option named 'linkcheck_anchors_ignore_for_url' and modifies the '_check_uri' method to handle the new logic. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests a different configuration option 'linkcheck_anchors_disabled' and a different method 'is_anchor_check_disabled'. While the RESPONSE's approach could potentially solve the issue, it does not match the git diff's solution and introduces additional methods that are not present in the diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a somewhat different solution to the issue.",
