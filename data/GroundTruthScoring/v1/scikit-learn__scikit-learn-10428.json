    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the requested feature, which is to ensure that estimator methods give invariant results when applied to subsets of a dataset. The RESPONSE outlines the creation of a new test function, the generation of a random dataset and mask, fitting the estimator, looping through the methods, and using assert_allclose to check for equality within a tolerance level. This aligns well with the git diff, which also adds a new test function called check_methods_subset_invariance and performs similar checks.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the specific implementation details that are present in the git diff, such as the handling of different output types (e.g., tuples), the exclusion of certain estimator-method pairs, and the specific way of applying the function to the whole set and mini batches. While the RESPONSE is on the right track and would likely lead to a similar solution, it is not as complete or specific as the git diff. Therefore, it does not warrant a perfect score but is still highly relevant and useful.",
