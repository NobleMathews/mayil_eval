    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on handling array sizes and NaN values when using the `ax.scatter` method in 3D plots, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific bug described in the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking for NaN values and ensuring consistent array sizes, which is related to the problem described in the issue. However, it does not offer a solution to the specific bug where the color array is not being masked in accordance with the NaN values in the `x`, `y`, and `z` arrays. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `scatter` method in `axes3d.py` to handle the color array correctly when NaN values are present. The RESPONSE fails to mention modifying the method or handling the `kwargs` to fix the bug, which is the core of the solution provided in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, which does not add value in the context of the specific issue.",
