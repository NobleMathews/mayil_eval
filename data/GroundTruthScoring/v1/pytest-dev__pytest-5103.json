    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the `is_even` function and ensuring `even_stevens` is initialized correctly, which is not relevant to the issue of improving the failure messages of `all`/`any` assertions. The suggestion to modify the `test_all_even` function to use a loop for better error messages is somewhat aligned with the issue's goal but does not address the specific implementation of the assertion rewriter as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to mention or suggest any changes related to the assertion rewriter, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to unroll the iterable for `all`/`any` calls to get better reports. The RESPONSE is not entirely unhelpful, as it does suggest a method to improve error messages, but it does not align with the git diff's solution and is therefore scored as a 1.",
