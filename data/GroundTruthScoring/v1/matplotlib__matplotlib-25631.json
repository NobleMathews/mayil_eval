{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution to the issue with `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` causing unexpected behavior when used with `grab_frame()` in the `FFMpegWriter` class. It suggests removing or commenting out any usage of `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` where `grab_frame()` is called, which aligns with the git diff that introduces a validation function to prevent the use of `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` during animation frame grabbing. The RESPONSE also advises on handling the `matplotlib.rcParams` if `bbox_inches=\"tight\"` is set globally, which is a relevant consideration not explicitly covered in the git diff but is important for the issue at hand. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `tight_layout` before animation frames are captured and ensuring consistent figure size, which is in line with the git diff's intent to maintain consistent frame sizes. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `_validate_grabframe_kwargs` function or the specific modifications to the context managers, but it does provide actionable advice that would lead to a similar outcome as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
