    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the core issue described, which is the incorrect initialization of the LogisticRegression instance without the multi_class parameter in the _log_reg_scoring_path function. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the _log_reg_scoring_path function to accept and pass the multi_class parameter to the LogisticRegression constructor, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding the multi_class=multi_class argument to the LogisticRegression constructor.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises ensuring that LogisticRegressionCV passes the multi_class parameter to _log_reg_scoring_path, which is consistent with the git diff's intent to ensure the multi_class setting is consistent between LogisticRegressionCV and LogisticRegression.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that would effectively resolve the issue, closely matching the git diff's solution. It also includes code snippets to illustrate the changes, which adds to the clarity and actionability of the guidance.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact code changes, as it suggests adding the multi_class parameter to the function signature of _log_reg_scoring_path and ensuring it is passed from LogisticRegressionCV. However, this does not detract from the value of the RESPONSE, as it achieves the same result as the git diff and is a valid alternative approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the change in the default value of intercept_scaling to float, which is present in the git diff. However, this is not central to the issue described and does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE in resolving the main problem.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a highly relevant and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a high score.",
