    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive approach to adding support for the C++20 spaceship operator in the Sphinx documentation generator. It correctly identifies the need to update the Sphinx C++ domain parser to recognize the new operator, which is in line with the git diff that adds the spaceship operator to the operator lists and updates the parsing logic. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests ensuring that the '_id_operator_v2' dictionary includes an entry for the spaceship operator with the abbreviation 'ss', which matches the git diff's addition. Furthermore, the RESPONSE advises verifying and modifying grammar rules and AST classes if necessary, which is a broader instruction that encompasses the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also appropriately suggests checking the Breathe extension for compatibility and testing the changes, which, while not directly reflected in the git diff, are relevant to ensuring full support for the operator. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff line by line but provides a valid and effective alternative approach to achieving the same result. The only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it includes additional suggestions regarding the Breathe extension and testing, which, while valuable, are not part of the git diff.",
