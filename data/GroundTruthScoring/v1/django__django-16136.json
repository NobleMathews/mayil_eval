    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but may not closely match the git diff. It should provide some guidance towards resolving the issue but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `Demo` class to handle GET requests properly by either implementing a synchronous `get` method or making the existing `get` method asynchronous. It also provides an example of an asynchronous `get` method and mentions using decorators to restrict HTTP methods. While these suggestions are related to handling HTTP methods in Django views, they do not address the core issue described, which is the inability to use `HttpResponseNotAllowed` in an 'await' expression within an asynchronous context.\n\nThe git diff provided shows a modification to the `http_method_not_allowed` method in Django's base view to handle the response differently if the view is asynchronous. The RESPONSE does not mention or address this method or the approach taken in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on modifying the `Demo` class, which is not the root cause of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's approach and does not effectively guide the developer in resolving the specific issue of `HttpResponseNotAllowed` being incompatible with async contexts. Therefore, it only scores a 2 as it offers some relevant information about handling HTTP methods in Django but fails to provide actionable guidance aligned with the git diff.",
