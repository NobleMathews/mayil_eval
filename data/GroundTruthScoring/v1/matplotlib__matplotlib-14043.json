    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice on how to address the issue of error bars breaking when the `zorder` is greater than 1 in bar plots. It suggests modifying the `errorbar` method to respect the `zorder` parameter for both the line collection (error bars) and the cap lines, which is relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically modifies the `bar` method to handle the `zorder` of error bars by incrementing it slightly to ensure error bars are drawn on top of bars. The RESPONSE instead suggests adding a `zorder` parameter to the `errorbar` method and setting the `zorder` for error bars and caps within this method, which is a different approach than the one taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff and provides links to code snippets for further investigation, which are helpful but not directly related to the specific changes needed to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a somewhat different solution to the problem.",
