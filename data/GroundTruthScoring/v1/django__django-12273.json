    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the 'Derived' model does not override the 'save' method in a way that prevents the creation of a new record, and to use 'super().save(force_insert=True)' in the 'reset' method to force the creation of a new record. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of resetting the primary key, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves setting the parent link's target field attribute to the new value of the primary key when the '_set_pk_val' method is called. The RESPONSE does not address the need to update the parent link's target field attribute, which is a key aspect of the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff's solution and would not resolve the issue as described.",
