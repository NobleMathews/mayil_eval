    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the `Engine.render_to_string` method to ensure that the `autoescape` attribute is honored when a `Context` is created, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE goes further by proposing the addition of an `autoescape` parameter to the method signature, allowing for more flexibility. This is not exactly what the git diff does, but it is a valid alternative approach that achieves the same goal of honoring the `autoescape` attribute. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the proposed changes, which is actionable and relevant. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking other parts of the code that might be affected by this change, which is a good practice. However, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, which simply adds `autoescape=self.autoescape` to the existing `Context` constructor call without introducing a new parameter. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for providing a highly relevant alternative solution that achieves the same result as the git diff.",
