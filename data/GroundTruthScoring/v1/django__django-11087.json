    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described in the ISSUE. The git diff shows changes to the Django model deletion code to optimize the .delete() method by deferring the fetching of non-referenced fields and checking for signal listeners. The RESPONSE, however, suggests general troubleshooting steps for UnicodeDecodeError and database connection settings, which are not related to the optimization of the .delete() method. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that would help in resolving the issue of optimizing the .delete() method to use only required fields, as described in the ISSUE and addressed in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue and does not offer a viable alternative approach.",
