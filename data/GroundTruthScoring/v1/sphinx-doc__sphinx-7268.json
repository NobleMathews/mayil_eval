    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `setup` function in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module to automatically load the `sphinx.ext.autodoc.typehints` extension, which is exactly what the git diff shows. The RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code example that closely matches the actual change in the git diff, where the `app.setup_extension('sphinx.ext.autodoc.typehints')` call is added to the `setup` function. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific lines of code changed, but it achieves the same result and is therefore highly relevant and useful for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE is not scored a perfect 10 because it includes additional context and links to code snippets that, while potentially useful, are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff.",
