    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ax.errorbar` call within the `seaborn/relational.py` file, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the changes should be made in the `seaborn/regression.py` file, specifically within the `scatterplot` method. The RESPONSE does not address the correct file or method and instead provides guidance on a different part of the codebase. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `alpha` parameter to the `ci_kws` dictionary, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
