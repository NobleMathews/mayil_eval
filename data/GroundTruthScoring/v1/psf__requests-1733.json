    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is almost perfectly aligned with the git diff. It suggests adding the __getstate__ method to the Response class, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle all attributes defined in __attrs__, which is reflected in the git diff's implementation of __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to mention handling __slots__, which is not present in the git diff, but this does not detract from the accuracy of the solution since __slots__ is not used in the Response class. The RESPONSE also includes the correct handling of the _content_consumed attribute and the exclusion of the raw attribute, which cannot be pickled, both of which are present in the git diff.\n\nThe only minor discrepancy is that the RESPONSE suggests setting 'raw' to None in the __getstate__ method, while the git diff does not explicitly set 'raw' to None but rather sets '_content_consumed' to True. However, this does not significantly impact the effectiveness of the RESPONSE's solution, as the key aspect is ensuring that non-pickleable attributes are not included in the pickled state.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and would effectively resolve the issue of allowing the Response class to be pickled.",
