    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE incorrectly states that the `Chr` function is already correctly setting `output_field = CharField()`, which contradicts the git diff that shows this line being added as a fix to the issue. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the need for this change and instead suggests checking the `Value` function and database backend-specific implementations, which are not relevant to the fix shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff, and therefore does not assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
