    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides detailed and accurate instructions for updating the printing methods for `ZeroMatrix`, `OneMatrix`, and `Identity` in the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` and `sympy/printing/mathml.py` files, which is in line with the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly addresses the changes needed in `sympy/printing/latex.py` to ensure that the LaTeX representations for these matrices are consistent with the `mat_symbol_style` settings. The RESPONSE is missing the change in `sympy/matrices/expressions/hadamard.py` where `A.*OneMatrix(2, 2)` is replaced with `A.*1`, but this is a minor omission relative to the overall issue, which focuses on the printing of `OneMatrix`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff, despite the minor omission.",
