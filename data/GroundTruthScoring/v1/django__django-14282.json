    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and refactoring the `makemigrations` command to remove any dependency on `SECRET_KEY`, which is a reasonable approach to ensure that the command can run without a `SECRET_KEY`. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix implemented was to modify the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class in `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py` by adding a property for `secret` with a getter and setter method, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the broader issue of running `makemigrations` without a `SECRET_KEY`, but it fails to provide the specific guidance needed to implement the fix shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
