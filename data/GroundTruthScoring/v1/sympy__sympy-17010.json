    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a check for `n.is_integer and n.is_nonpositive` before the recursive call in `chebyshevu` to prevent infinite recursion. This suggestion is somewhat relevant to the issue as it attempts to address the infinite recursion problem. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which adds a check for `elif not (-n - 2).could_extract_minus_sign():` instead of checking if `n` is a non-positive integer. The RESPONSE's solution might prevent some cases of infinite recursion, but it does not cover all scenarios that the git diff addresses. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the other changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `legendre` and `laguerre` functions, and the update to the Wikipedia link in the documentation. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks completeness in comparison to the git diff.",
