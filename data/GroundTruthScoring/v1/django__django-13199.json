    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `delete_cookie` method in the `HttpResponse` class to include a `samesite` parameter and ensuring that the `set_cookie` method call within `delete_cookie` includes the `samesite` parameter. This approach is consistent with the git diff, which also adds the `samesite` parameter to the `delete_cookie` method and ensures it is passed to the `set_cookie` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to pass the `samesite` attribute when calling `delete_cookie` from anywhere in the code, which is in line with the git diff's changes to other files where `delete_cookie` is called. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the additional parameters (`secure` and `httponly`) included in the `delete_cookie` method signature, but this does not detract from the effectiveness of the solution. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue, justifying a score of 9.",
