    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifications to the `Function` and `Symbol` classes to handle assumptions, which is relevant to the issue of assumptions not working for functions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows changes in the `Function` class, the `UndefinedFunction` class, and the `implemented_function` function, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `Symbol.__call__` method and the `expand` method in the `Function` class is not supported by the git diff and does not address the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not reflect the changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of comparison checks for `UndefinedFunction` and `AppliedUndef` in `basic.py`, the addition of assumption handling in `function.py`, and the update to `lambdify.py` to handle implemented functions correctly. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of assumptions with functions but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
