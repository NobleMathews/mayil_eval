    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are somewhat aligned with the git diff, suggesting an investigation into the `Axes.bar` method and the `_safe_first_finite` function to handle `np.nan` values without raising a `StopIteration` exception. It also recommends modifying the `_safe_first_finite` function to return a default value instead of raising an exception, which is not directly reflected in the git diff but could be considered a viable alternative approach to the problem. The RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, such as adding the `except StopIteration` block and using `cbook.safe_first_element(x0)` as a fallback, but it does touch on the broader issue of handling `np.nan` values in the `x` argument. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a unit test, which is a good practice but not part of the git diff. The provided code snippets are not directly relevant to the fix but could be useful for understanding the context of the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that is partially relevant to the git diff but does not closely match the specific changes made.",
