    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the issue described. The git diff shows a comprehensive change to the way pytest handles expressions, including the introduction of a new file `expression.py` to evaluate match expressions and modifications to `legacy.py` to use the new evaluation system. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests confirming if the issue persists in the latest version of pytest, using alphanumeric keywords or adding a prefix/suffix to numeric keywords, and reporting the issue to the developers. These suggestions do not address the specific problem of handling numeric keywords in expressions and do not offer a solution that would fix the underlying issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and does not provide any actionable guidance aligned with the git diff.",
