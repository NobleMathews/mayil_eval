    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to cookies not being persisted on redirects within a `Session` and the occurrence of a `KeyError` when trying to access the `'Cookie'` header. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Instead, it suggests modifying the `extract_cookies_to_jar` function and ensuring the `Cookie` header is set correctly after a redirect, which is not addressed in the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the `cookiejar_from_dict` function to add an `overwrite` parameter and to prevent overwriting existing cookies in the jar, as well as a modification to the `PreparedRequest.copy` method to ensure headers are copied correctly. The RESPONSE does not mention these changes and instead focuses on the `extract_cookies_to_jar` function and the handling of the `Cookie` header, which are not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses cookie handling, but it does not provide actionable steps that would lead to the resolution of the issue as per the git diff.",
