    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a 'depth' parameter to the 'timesince' function with a default value of 2, which aligns with the git diff and the issue description. It also correctly identifies the need to raise a ValueError if 'depth' is less than or equal to 0, which is present in the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE proposes extracting the time calculation logic into a separate function called 'calculate_time_chunks', which is not part of the git diff. The git diff does not extract any logic into a separate function but instead modifies the existing 'timesince' function to handle the 'depth' parameter directly. This is a significant deviation from the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests updating the loop that builds the result string to respect the 'depth' parameter, which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's code snippet for the loop does not match the git diff's implementation, which uses a while loop and a list to accumulate the results, whereas the RESPONSE suggests using a for loop and an enumeration, which is not present in the git diff.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE correctly updates the 'timeuntil' function to pass the 'depth' parameter to 'timesince', which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and partially relevant, which warrants a score of 4.",
