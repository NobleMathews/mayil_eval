    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the creation of a custom `RelatedManager` that overrides the `set()` method to handle foreign keys provided as strings. This advice is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which modifies the `set()` method to ensure proper handling of foreign key values. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific implementation shown in the git diff, which involves modifying the existing `set()` method to use `get_prep_value()` for non-model instances. Instead, it suggests a broader approach that involves overriding the `set()` method in a custom manager. While this could be a viable alternative, it is not as closely aligned with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also discusses the broader implications of whether Django should handle this issue, which is relevant but not directly related to the technical solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but does not closely match the git diff.",
