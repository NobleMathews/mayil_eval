    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to verify and ensure that `sample_weight` is being used correctly in various functions related to KMeans clustering. However, it lacks specific actionable changes that align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests checking if `sample_weight` is normalized, passed correctly, and not modified or ignored, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide concrete code changes or address the specific modifications shown in the git diff, such as the addition of `sample_weight` as a parameter in several functions and the changes in how `sample_weight` is used in calculations.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the functions to include `sample_weight` as a parameter and ensuring it is used in the centroid calculation and initialization steps. Instead, it provides a high-level checklist for verification without specific guidance on how to implement the necessary changes. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly actionable and do not reflect the changes in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks the actionable content and close alignment with the git diff necessary to score higher.",
