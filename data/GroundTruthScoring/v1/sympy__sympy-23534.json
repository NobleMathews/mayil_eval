    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the extra parentheses in the `symbols` function call and changing the syntax to avoid the issue with deconstructing output into separate tuples. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which modifies the `literal` function in `sympy/core/symbol.py` to ensure that the `cls` argument is passed correctly when creating symbols. The RESPONSE does not address the actual issue, which is the incorrect handling of the `cls` argument within the `literal` function. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required, as the git diff indicates that the change needs to be made in the `literal` function, not in the `dynamicsymbols` function or the definition of `UndefinedFunction`. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
