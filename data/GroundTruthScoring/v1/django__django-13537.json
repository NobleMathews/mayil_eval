    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely match the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update the `settings_to_cmd_args` method in `django/db/backends/mysql/client.py` to handle the `charset` option, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests adding the line to check for the `charset` and append the necessary argument to the command arguments, which is in line with the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to suggest verifying the `charset` option in the `DATABASES` setting and ensuring that the `dbshell` command uses the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method, which is not directly addressed in the git diff but is relevant for troubleshooting the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides guidance on extending the patch to support other backends, which is not part of the git diff but is a valid consideration given the context of the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that no changes are required in other files based on the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of file names and method names (e.g., `settings_to_cmd_args_env` instead of `settings_to_cmd_args`), but the intent and the solution are effectively the same. The RESPONSE also provides additional context and troubleshooting steps that are relevant to the issue, although not part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a high score. It does not match every aspect of the git diff exactly, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
