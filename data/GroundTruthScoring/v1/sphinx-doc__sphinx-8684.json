{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and clear guidance on how to implement the feature request to extend the `:dedent:` behavior in Sphinx to match the Python `textwrap.dedent` functionality. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `dedent_lines` function and the `run` method of the `CodeBlock` class in `sphinx/directives/code.py`. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets that closely match the changes shown in the git diff, such as using `textwrap.dedent` and handling the case where `dedent` is `None`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the documentation, which, while not shown in the git diff, is a relevant and important step in implementing a new feature. The only minor discrepancy is that the RESPONSE does not mention the change to the `option_spec` for the `dedent` option to use `optional_int`, which is present in the git diff. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is addressed effectively. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
