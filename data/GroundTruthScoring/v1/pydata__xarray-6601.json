    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and potentially modifying the `polyval` function to maintain the dimension order of the input `coord` in the output, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows a simple change in the order of operations within the `polyval` function, specifically swapping the order of `zeros_like(coord)` and `coeffs.isel({degree_dim: max_deg}, drop=True)`. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests reordering the dimensions of the result to match the input using `xarray.DataArray.transpose` or `xarray.DataArray.reindex_like` methods, which is a different approach and not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution but rather a general strategy that might be more complex than necessary. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for understanding the context but do not offer a concrete solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, hence the score of 2.",
