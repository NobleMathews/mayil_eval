    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the core issue with the `filter_meta_fields` function in `sphinx/domains/python.py`, which is the incorrect iteration over the fields list when removing meta-fields. It suggests verifying that the loop iterates over all fields in reverse order, which is precisely what the git diff does by using `reversed(fields)`. The RESPONSE also correctly points out the need to check if all meta-fields are identified by the condition and suggests refactoring the loop to collect fields to be removed first, which is a valid alternative approach to the problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises testing the function with the provided example to ensure the fix is effective. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not explicitly mention using `reversed()` as the git diff does, but it does suggest iterating in reverse order, which is effectively the same solution.",
