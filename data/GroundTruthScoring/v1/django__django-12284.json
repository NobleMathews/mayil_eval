    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_field_foo_display` method in class B and overriding the `choices` attribute in the `__init__` method of class B. However, the git diff indicates that the issue is resolved within the Django framework's `contribute_to_class` method, specifically by not overriding the `get_FOO_display` method if it is already defined in the class dictionary. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the Django framework's handling of inherited choices and instead provides a workaround that might not be necessary or effective given the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of inherited choices, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
