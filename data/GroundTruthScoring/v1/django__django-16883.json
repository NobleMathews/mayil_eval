    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of allowing users to override the table name to model conversion logic in a custom `inspectdb` command. It suggests adding a new method `get_model_name` to the `Command` class and using it to replace the inline `table2model` function, which is in line with the git diff's approach of replacing the `table2model` function with a method `normalize_table_name`.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed method `get_model_name` serves a similar purpose to the `normalize_table_name` method in the git diff, and the RESPONSE correctly identifies that the method should be called within the `handle_inspection` method to generate the `model_name`. This aligns with the git diff's changes where `normalize_table_name` is used for the same purpose.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the method name and the exact implementation details. The git diff introduces `normalize_table_name` as the method to be used, while the RESPONSE suggests `get_model_name`. Despite this difference, the RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative and would achieve the same result as the git diff, which is to allow users to override the table to model name conversion logic.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides an example of how a user might override the method in a custom command, which is helpful and adds value for developers looking to implement this feature. The inclusion of code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the codebase is a useful addition for developers to reference.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff's approach, although it does not match it exactly in terms of method names and lacks some of the specific implementation details provided in the git diff.",
