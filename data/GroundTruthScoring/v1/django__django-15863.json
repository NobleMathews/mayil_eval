    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that align with the git diff and the issue description. It correctly identifies the need to maintain the original precision of Decimal instances and suggests modifying the `floatformat` filter to handle `Decimal` instances directly. This is in line with the git diff, which changes the conversion from `repr(text)` to `str(text)` to avoid precision loss. The RESPONSE also correctly advises against casting to strings or floats, which can cause precision loss, and this is supported by the git diff's removal of the `repr` function which could lead to a string representation that loses precision.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests removing a line of code `d = Decimal(str(float(text)))` that does not exist in the actual code or the git diff. This is a minor discrepancy as the RESPONSE still correctly identifies the core issue of precision loss during conversion. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not explicitly mention the `repr` function, which is the actual line of code being modified in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides a correct testing step, which is to ensure the output is accurate when no argument is provided and when an argument is provided, aligning with the issue description that involves testing with a specific Decimal value.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes a minor inaccuracy regarding the specific line of code to be modified. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
