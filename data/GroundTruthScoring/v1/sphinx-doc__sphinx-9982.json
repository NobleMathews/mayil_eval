    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a variety of checks and potential areas to investigate, such as configuration settings, theme CSS/JavaScript, and extension code. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `SphinxWarningLogRecord` class to handle different log levels with appropriate prefixes, which is a direct approach to ensuring that different warning levels are displayed with the correct prefix and potentially the correct color. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, does not mention modifying the log record class or handling log levels. It instead focuses on a broader and less targeted set of potential issues, such as checking configuration files and theme-related files, which are not addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the general topic of warning colors in Sphinx, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
