    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the `Flask` class in `src/flask/app.py` to include a `redirect` method and updating the `redirect` function in `src/flask/helpers.py` to use the new method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for the `redirect` method to check for a `current_app` and call its `redirect` method if available, falling back to Werkzeug's `redirect` if not. This matches the intent of the git diff, which is to move the `redirect` function to the `Flask` app object and allow applications to override the redirect behavior. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details, such as the use of the `_wz_redirect` alias and the addition of the `Response` parameter in the `redirect` method signature. However, these differences do not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as it still achieves the desired outcome. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its close alignment with the git diff and its effectiveness in addressing the issue.",
