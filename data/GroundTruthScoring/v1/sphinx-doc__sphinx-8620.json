    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue of differentiating container `<kbd>` elements from child `<kbd>` elements in the HTML output generated by the `:kbd:` role in Sphinx. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `KeyboardTransform` class in the `sphinx/builders/html/transforms.py` file, which is the correct file to address the issue. The RESPONSE's solution involves creating a new container node for compound keystrokes and adding the `compound` class to it, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding the 'compound' class to the node's classes. However, the RESPONSE suggests replacing the current node's children with the new container node and appending each key and separator to the container node, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff simply appends the 'compound' class to the existing node's classes and does not involve creating a new node or altering the structure of the children. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers a clear solution, it does not perfectly match the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE's solution is a bit more complex than necessary, but it still aims to achieve the same result, which is to allow for proper CSS styling of compound keystrokes. Hence, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and clear guidance, despite the slight deviation from the git diff.",
