    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to handle the LaTeX representation of the 90-degree angle, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff shows that the actual implementation involves adding support for the `Quantity` class and specifically handling the 'degree' unit within the LaTeX and pretty printers of SymPy. The RESPONSE incorrectly suggests replacing the `90^^\\circ` with `pi/2` in radians, which is not reflected in the git diff and does not address the issue of supporting the degree unit in LaTeX and pretty printing. The RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code snippet that does not match the changes in the git diff and would not resolve the issue as described. The RESPONSE does not provide a valid alternative to the git diff and fails to offer actionable guidance that would lead to a correct implementation. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
