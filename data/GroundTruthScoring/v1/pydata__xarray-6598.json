    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `_decode_cf_datetime_dtype` function to handle `uint` data types and adding unit tests for this case. However, the git diff indicates that the actual change was made in the `_decode_datetime_with_pandas` function, where the condition was updated to check for integer and unsigned integer data types (`'iu'`) and then cast them to `np.int64`. The RESPONSE does not mention the correct function or the specific change needed, which is to update the condition to include unsigned integers. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of handling `uint` data types, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
