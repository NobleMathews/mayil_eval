    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests defining new abstract base classes (ABCs) using `ABCMeta` for checkers and reporters, updating existing classes to inherit from these ABCs, and modifying the `PyLinter` class to use `isinstance` checks. While this approach is conceptually aligned with the ISSUE's goal of supporting `isinstance` checks, it does not closely match the git diff provided. The git diff shows the addition of deprecation warnings for the `__implements__` pattern and does not indicate the creation of new ABCs or modification of inheritance. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as adding deprecation warnings and modifying the way checkers are categorized. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide the necessary guidance to implement the changes shown in the git diff.",
