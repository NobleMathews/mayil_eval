    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of making mixture models more like clusterers. It addresses the three main points raised in the issue: parameter naming consistency, storing training labels, and adding a `fit_predict` method. The RESPONSE suggests renaming `n_components` to `n_clusters`, storing `labels_` after fitting the model, and implementing a `fit_predict` method, which are all in line with the git diff. The git diff shows the implementation of a `fit_predict` method and the adjustment of the `fit` method to return labels, which is consistent with the RESPONSE's suggestion to add a `fit_predict` method and store labels after fitting. However, the RESPONSE does not include the actual code changes made in the git diff, such as the specific implementation of the `fit_predict` method and the changes to the `fit` method. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not match the git diff in its entirety, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
