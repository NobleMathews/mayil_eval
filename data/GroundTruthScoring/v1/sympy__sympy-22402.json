    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the `arg` function in SymPy should simplify nested `arg` calls to a single `arg` call, which is a reasonable assumption based on the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which implements a more complex behavior where the `arg` function can nest up to three times before returning `nan`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to simplify nested `arg` calls to a single `arg` call does not address the specific behavior implemented in the git diff, which includes handling for real numbers and a limit on the nesting level. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
