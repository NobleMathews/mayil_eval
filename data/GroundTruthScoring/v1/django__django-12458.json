{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that align well with the git diff and the issue description. It suggests updating the `sort_dependencies` function to handle circular references by setting `allow_cycles=True`, which is exactly what the git diff does. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the `dumpdata` command to avoid enforcing ordering when natural keys are not used, which is reflected in the git diff changes to `dumpdata.py`. The RESPONSE further mentions ensuring that `loaddata` can handle forward references and adjusting the `create_test_db` method, which are relevant to the broader context of the issue but not directly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes but gives a high-level overview of the necessary modifications, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. However, it is actionable and closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
