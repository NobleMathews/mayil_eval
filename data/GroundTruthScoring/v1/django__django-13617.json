    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue with the GROUP BY clause in Django ORM queries, which is relevant to the issue described. It suggests reviewing the proposed patch, ensuring correct `group_by` logic, verifying methods that manipulate the GROUP BY clause, testing with the example query, and ensuring no regressions occur. These steps are actionable and align with the general direction of the git diff, which aims to fix the GROUP BY logic in the `Query` class.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on the changes needed in the code, such as the introduction of the `selected` variable and the modification of the condition to check against `selected` instead of just `field_names`. The git diff provides a concrete solution by modifying the `set_values` method and the condition within the loop that processes the `group_by` list. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes, which are key to resolving the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which may lead the developer to review unrelated code sections. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a high-level approach, it lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff that would make it more valuable for resolving the issue.",
