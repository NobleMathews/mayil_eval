    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `variables.py` file to ensure that imports used in type comments are not reported as unused, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff shows a specific change to handle `astroid.Attribute` instances in type annotations, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests a broader change to the `is_type_annotation_import` check and other related logic, which could be a valid approach but is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but it does not offer specific, actionable changes that align with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
