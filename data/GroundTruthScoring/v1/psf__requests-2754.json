    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring the .htaccess file uses the correct encoding and recommends using `RewriteRule` with the `[NE]` flag, which is not related to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also suggests using `quote` from `urllib.parse` to percent-encode the path, which is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE does mention modifying the `requote_uri` function in `requests.utils` to handle non-ASCII characters appropriately, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff, as the diff includes changes to the `unquote_unreserved` function in `requests.utils`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on encoding the location URL with 'latin1' or handling the conversion between bytes and unicode strings as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also references checking server configuration and the `get_unicode_from_response` and `get_redirect_target` functions, which are not part of the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant information but does not closely match the git diff's approach to the issue.",
