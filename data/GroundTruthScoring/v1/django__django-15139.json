{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan for deprecating `PickleSerializer` and moving it out of the core, which aligns with the issue's goal. It suggests adding a deprecation warning, creating a third-party package, replacing internal usage with a safer alternative, updating documentation, and communicating the changes, which are all relevant steps.\n\nThe RESPONSE correctly includes the addition of a deprecation warning, as shown in the git diff. However, it does not mention the specific `RemovedInDjango50Warning` used in the git diff, which is a minor discrepancy.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests replacing `PickleSerializer` with `JSONSerializer` or another safe alternative, which is a valid approach but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The git diff does not show the replacement of `PickleSerializer` with `JSONSerializer` within Django's codebase, but it does remove references to `PickleSerializer` and updates the `RedisSerializer` to not inherit from it, which is in line with the RESPONSE's suggestion to replace its usage.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to session handling and Redis cache backend serialization as shown in the git diff, which are key elements of the solution. However, it does provide a high-level overview that would guide a developer in the right direction.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, but it is not a perfect match as it omits some specific changes and details present in the git diff. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
