    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is caused by an incompatibility between the expected `Toolbar` trait type in the `Canvas` class and the actual `NavigationToolbar2WebAgg` instance being used. It recommends ensuring that `NavigationToolbar2WebAgg` is a subclass of `Toolbar` or updating the `Canvas` class's `toolbar` trait to accept `NavigationToolbar2WebAgg` instances. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix involved changing the import statement from `backend_webagg_core` to `backend_webagg` and setting `_toolbar2_class` to `None` while keeping `ToolbarCls` as `NavigationToolbar2WebAgg` in the `FigureManagerWebAgg` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. It does not mention the change in the import statement, nor does it suggest setting `_toolbar2_class` to `None`. Instead, it focuses on subclassing and trait definitions, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the incompatibility issue but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's solution. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
