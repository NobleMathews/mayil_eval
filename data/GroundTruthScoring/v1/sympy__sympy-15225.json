    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue with the `bool_map` function incorrectly mapping `f1` (XOR) and `f2` (XNOR) is likely due to a flaw in the `match` function. It recommends adding a check to compare the negation status of the top-level operators in `function1` and `function2`. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the `match` function. Instead, the git diff focuses on the `_finger` function, adding a check for unexpected levels of nesting and adjusting the fingerprinting logic. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the implementation of the nesting check or the adjustment to the fingerprinting logic. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the same function (`bool_map`) and suggests a potential area of the problem (logical equivalence checking), it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant sections of code, but it does not directly assist in fixing the issue as per the git diff.",
