{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately instructs to remove the subset check from `check_language_settings_consistent` in `django/core/checks/translation.py`, which aligns with the git diff that removes the E005 error check. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the function should no longer return the `translation.E005` error, which is consistent with the git diff that removes the related code block and the error message.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed. However, it does not explicitly mention the removal of the E005 error definition, which is included in the git diff. This omission is minor and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, hence the score of 9 instead of a perfect 10.",
