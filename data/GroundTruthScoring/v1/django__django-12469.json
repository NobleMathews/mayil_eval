    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `timezone.localtime` function to respect the user's timezone, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the `timezone` import and its use in the `date_hierarchy` function. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to modify the date range calculation for the filter to account for the user's timezone, which is consistent with the git diff's changes to handle `dates` and `datetimes` differently and the introduction of `qs_kwargs` to pass `is_dst` when necessary.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `DateFieldListFilter` class is not directly reflected in the git diff, but it is a reasonable assumption that changes might be needed in related classes to fully address the issue. The RESPONSE also provides a detailed list of code snippets to check, which includes the correct file (`admin_list.py`) and lines that were modified in the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `get_fields_from_path` function or the specific logic to determine whether to use `dates` or `datetimes` based on the field type, which are key parts of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using a non-existent `convert_to_user_timezone` function, which is not part of the git diff or the Django codebase, leading to a slight misalignment.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is largely in line with the git diff, but it is not a perfect match due to some omissions and the suggestion of a non-existent function.",
