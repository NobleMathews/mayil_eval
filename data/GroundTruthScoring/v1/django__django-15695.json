    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable suggestions, such as checking if the new index name already exists before performing the rename operation and handling the case where the index being renamed already exists. These suggestions are relevant to the issue of `RenameIndex()` crashing when unnamed indexes are moved backward and forward. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff, which specifically adds a check to return early from the `database_forwards` method if the old index name is the same as the new name, thus avoiding the crash. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific solution but instead offers a broader range of potential fixes. While these fixes could be relevant, they do not directly address the change made in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which could be helpful for a developer looking to understand where the issue might be in the codebase. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a clear and direct solution that matches the git diff's approach to the issue.",
