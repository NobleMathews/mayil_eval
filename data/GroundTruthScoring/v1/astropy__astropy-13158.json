    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff. It fails to aide developers in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE, which is the failure of model evaluation when a parameter has a `MagUnit` type value. Instead, it provides a generic and vague suggestion to modify the `Quantity` class and the handling of `MagUnit` instances without any specific guidance or reference to the changes made in the git diff.\n\nThe git diff provided shows specific changes to the handling of `MagUnit` in various files, including the addition of the `subok=True` parameter to `Quantity` calls and the introduction of the `mag` parameter in the `Parameter` class. The RESPONSE does not mention any of these changes or provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same result.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE includes a section titled 'Code snippets to check' with links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the issue or the git diff. This section does not provide value in the context of fixing the issue and does not align with the git diff's approach.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to offer any insights or actionable steps that would assist a developer in resolving the issue described, and it does not align with the git diff in any way.",
