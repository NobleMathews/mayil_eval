{
    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by instructing the developer to locate the file `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and search for instances where `FieldError` is raised, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It also suggests modifying the error messages to include the field name and model name, which aligns with the ISSUE's request to include the field that caused the error in the error message. However, the RESPONSE suggests including the model name in the error message, which is not mentioned in the ISSUE or the GIT DIFF. The GIT DIFF specifically includes the field name and the value that caused the error, not the model name. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not part of the GIT DIFF, which could lead the developer to modify unrelated parts of the code. The RESPONSE does not match the GIT DIFF's approach of including the field's name and value in the error message, and it introduces the model name without any indication that this is required. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not fully address the ISSUE as per the GIT DIFF. The score is set to 3 because the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the GIT DIFF.",
