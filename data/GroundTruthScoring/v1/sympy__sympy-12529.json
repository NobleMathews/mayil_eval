    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `totient` class method `eval` to check if the input `n` is a non-integer number and raise a `ValueError` if it is not an integer. This aligns with the git diff's intent to raise an error for non-integer inputs. However, the RESPONSE suggests using `sympify(n).is_Integer` to check if the input is an integer, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff uses `isinstance(n, Expr)` and checks `n.is_integer` and `n.is_positive` directly without the use of `sympify`. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises removing a condition that is actually added in the git diff, which indicates a misunderstanding of the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE does not mention the import of `Expr` from `sympy.core.expr`, which is included in the git diff and is necessary for the isinstance check. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in its guidance.",
