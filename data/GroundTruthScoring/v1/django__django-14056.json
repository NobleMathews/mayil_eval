    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'collectstatic' command to log a warning for missing directories in 'STATICFILES_DIRS' and continue processing. However, the git diff shows changes in 'django/contrib/staticfiles/finders.py', not in the 'collectstatic' command file. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the 'BaseFinder' class or adding a warning to the 'check' method, which is what the git diff indicates.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of handling missing directories in 'STATICFILES_DIRS' by logging a warning instead of raising an error. However, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach of modifying the 'BaseFinder' class and adding a warning within the 'check' method. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the necessary changes to the 'list' method to skip nonexistent directories, which is a key part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a pseudo-code snippet and references to code locations that are not aligned with the git diff's solution. This could lead the developer in the wrong direction, as the actual changes need to be made in a different part of the codebase.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff, resulting in a score of 2.",
