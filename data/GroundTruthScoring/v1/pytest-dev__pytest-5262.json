    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `write` method of the `EncodedFile` class to handle both `str` and `bytes` types, which is a reasonable approach to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which adds a `mode` property to the `EncodedFile` class to remove the 'b' from the mode string of the underlying buffer. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `write` method is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not address the specific issue of the `mode` property including a 'b' character. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant information about checking code snippets that are not related to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff.",
