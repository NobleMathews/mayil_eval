    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution to the issue of handling commas in filter values within the Django admin interface. It correctly identifies the 'prepare_lookup_value' function as the target for modification and suggests adding a 'list_separator' parameter to handle different separators, which aligns with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the 'FieldListFilter' class to pass the new 'list_separator' parameter to the 'prepare_lookup_value' function, which is consistent with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE introduces the concept of a 'field_name' parameter and a 'FacetsMixin' that are not present in the git diff, which could potentially lead to confusion. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to handle custom field types with inherent commas, which, while potentially useful, is not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional suggestions not present in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
