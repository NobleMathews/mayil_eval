    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests simplifying the expression before integration and manually handling the integration for complex exponentials. It also suggests looking into the `integrate` function's implementation, specifically in the `risch.py` file, for potential fixes. However, the git diff indicates that the actual fix was made in the `fields.py` file, specifically in the `_rebuild` function, which is unrelated to the `integrate` function or the `risch.py` file. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as importing `Exp1` and `S`, modifying the conditional checks for `expr.is_Pow` and `isinstance(expr, (ExpBase, Exp1))`, and adjusting the logic for handling powers. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results, and it does not help the developer fix the issue as described.",
