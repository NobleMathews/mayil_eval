    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests optimizing the `_check_fix_default_value` method by only calling `timezone.now()` when necessary, which is somewhat aligned with the issue's description of simplifying the method. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which introduces helper functions `_to_naive` and `_get_naive_now` to refactor the code and address the issue more comprehensively. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check if the default is `timezone.now` and then call it is not reflected in the git diff, which does not make such a check. Instead, the git diff refactors the code to use helper functions to handle the conversion of time zones and checking of fixed default values. The RESPONSE does not address the bug mentioned in the issue or the refactoring of the code to use the new helper functions, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
