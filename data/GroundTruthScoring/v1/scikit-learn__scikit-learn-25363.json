    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. It provides incorrect guidance that does not match the changes made in the git diff, which focuses on updating import statements to use a new module for parallel processing utilities.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__call__` method in the `Parallel` class and the `__call__` method in the `_FuncWrapper` class to check for `config` and raise warnings, which is not related to the git diff. The git diff shows changes in import statements across various files, replacing `joblib` imports with imports from `sklearn.utils.parallel` for `delayed` and `Parallel`. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests updating a `linting.sh` script and removing the deprecated `delayed` function from `sklearn/utils/fixes.py`, neither of which are mentioned in the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
