    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the `figure.autolayout` setting and adjusting it or using an alternative method to apply `tight_layout`. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of `tight_layout` not working as expected, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `tight_layout` method within the `figure.py` file, specifically changing the argument passed to `self.set_layout_engine` from `None` to `'none'`. This suggests that the issue was resolved by a change in the code rather than by configuration adjustments or using alternative methods. The RESPONSE does not address the code change shown in the git diff and instead focuses on configuration and usage of the `tight_layout` method. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It does not help the developer to locate or understand the code change needed to fix the issue.",
