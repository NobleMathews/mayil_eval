    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general investigation into the memory spike and offers several broad strategies for optimizing memory usage, such as optimizing the `_average_path_length()` function, pre-allocating memory for arrays, and chunking data for processing. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows a refactoring of the `score_samples` method to compute scores in chunks to manage memory usage more efficiently, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does mention chunking data but does not connect this to the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of `gen_batches` and `get_chunk_n_rows` functions, or the restructuring of the score computation into separate methods. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing several parts of the code and profiling memory usage, which, while potentially helpful, are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, therefore it receives a score of 2.",
