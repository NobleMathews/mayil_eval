    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue with the precision_score function might be related to the handling of the `average=None` parameter and provides general advice on checking the `zero_division` parameter, verifying the `labels` parameter, and ensuring the correct use of `y_true`, `y_pred`, and `pos_label` parameters. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which adds notes to the documentation of several functions, including `precision_score`, to clarify the behavior when certain conditions are met (e.g., when true positive + false positive == 0). The RESPONSE fails to recognize that the issue is not with the function's usage or parameters but with the need to clarify the expected behavior through documentation. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable changes to the code or documentation that would resolve the issue described. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the precision_score function, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, thus warranting a score of 2.",
