    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue with `sympy.linsolve` might be due to numerical precision and the handling of floating-point numbers, and it offers general advice on how to potentially address such issues, such as using exact rational numbers or increasing the precision of floating-point numbers.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows specific code changes to the `sympy` library to address the issue. The git diff indicates that the problem was resolved by modifying the internal behavior of the `sympy` library, including changes to the way pivoting is handled in the `ddm_irref` function and the handling of real and complex fields in the `linsolve` function.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not offer any actionable guidance that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff, nor does it suggest an alternative implementation that would achieve the same result. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in discussing numerical precision issues, it does not provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative solution. The score of 2 reflects the RESPONSE's limited relevance and lack of actionable guidance in the context of the git diff.",
