    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests making the `scale_factor` attribute private and accessible only through a getter method, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff instead focuses on correcting the scale factors for the kilogram and gram units to align with the SI system, which is the root cause of the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as setting the scale factor of the kilogram to one and defining the gram in terms of the kilogram and the kilo prefix. While the RESPONSE does mention verifying and correcting the `scale_factor` for ohm, it does not provide specific guidance on how to implement this change, and it does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the `scale_factor` and its impact on unit conversion, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
