    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue by suggesting an update to the `standard_duration_re` regular expression pattern to handle negative hours in duration strings. The proposed fix in the RESPONSE closely aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the regular expression to correctly parse negative durations. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to update the pattern for `hours` and includes the negative sign in the pattern, which is consistent with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE introduces a slight variation by including the `_lazy_re_compile` function and using a different syntax for the `microseconds` group (using `[\r.,]` instead of `\r(?:\r.\r)`). These differences do not fundamentally change the outcome of the fix and are still relevant to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 8.",
