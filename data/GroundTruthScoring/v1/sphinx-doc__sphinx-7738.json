    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions, such as updating the 'napoleon_attr_annotations' setting, checking for known issues, and considering an upgrade of Sphinx. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff provided, which shows a specific change in the code where a condition is added to check for a configuration option 'strip_signature_backslash' before escaping the trailing underscore. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed and instead provides general troubleshooting steps that are not directly related to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and fails to provide actionable guidance that would help the developer fix the issue as per the git diff. The score is not 0 because the RESPONSE does suggest checking for known issues and upgrading, which could be tangentially related to resolving issues in general, but it is not specific or actionable enough in the context of the provided git diff.",
