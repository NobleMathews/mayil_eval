    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the 'random' filter in 'django/template/defaultfilters.py' to handle empty lists gracefully, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the problem. The RESPONSE also includes an additional check for an empty list before the try-except block, which is not present in the git diff but does not conflict with the intended solution and could be considered a more explicit way to handle the empty list case. The RESPONSE does not mention the 'first' and 'last' filters, which are not part of the git diff, but it does suggest ensuring that they handle empty lists appropriately, which is relevant to the expected behavior described in the issue. The RESPONSE provides actionable guidance and a code snippet that would help the developer fix the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes an additional check that is not present in the git diff, but this does not detract from the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",
