    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue with the `scatter` function in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` and offers a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the problem with the handling of the `c` parameter and suggests reviewing and modifying the conditional checks to handle the case when `c` has the same number of elements as `x` and `y`. This is in line with the git diff, which changes the way the size of `c` is compared to `x` and `y` and updates the error messages to be more informative.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests ensuring that `c` is properly flattened when intended for color mapping, which matches the git diff's change from `c_array.shape[0]` to `c_array.size` and the use of `c_array.ravel()`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to variable names (e.g., `xshape` to `xsize`, `n_elem` to `csize`) and the removal of the multiplication of shape elements to determine size, which are present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section with code snippets to check, which, while potentially helpful, is not directly related to the changes needed to fix the issue and thus does not contribute to the RESPONSE's alignment with the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not capture all the specific changes made in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
