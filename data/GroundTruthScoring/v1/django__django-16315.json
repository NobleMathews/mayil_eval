    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `on_conflict_suffix_sql` method to use the `db_column` attribute of the fields instead of the field name when constructing the `ON CONFLICT` clause. This is a reasonable approach to the problem described in the ISSUE, as it directly addresses the error caused by using the wrong column names in the SQL statement.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`, which involve adjusting the handling of `update_fields` and `unique_fields` within the `bulk_create` method and the `as_sql` method of the SQL compiler, respectively. The RESPONSE does not mention any changes to these files or methods, and instead focuses on a different file and method (`on_conflict_suffix_sql` in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/operations.py` or the corresponding file for the database in use).\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes instructions to check the model definition for correct `db_column` mappings, which is not relevant to the git diff or the core issue, as the problem lies in the Django framework's handling of the `ON CONFLICT` clause, not in the model definitions.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. It offers a somewhat relevant alternative solution but lacks alignment with the git diff and does not address the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
