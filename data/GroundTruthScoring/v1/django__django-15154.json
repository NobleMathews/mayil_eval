    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the case-insensitive `UniqueConstraint` from the `Tag` model and replacing it with a unique index, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff modifies the `total_unique_constraints` method in `options.py` to exclude unique constraints that contain expressions when checking for uniqueness. The RESPONSE does not address the actual issue, which is the incorrect handling of functional unique constraints in the Django admin interface. Instead, it proposes a change to the model's definition that is unrelated to the issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the changes needed to fix the issue. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a valid alternative solution.",
