    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `latex()` function to include an additional argument for specifying the notation for the natural logarithm, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of a new setting `ln_notation`. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to updating the `_print_Function()` method, while the git diff actually adds a new `_print_log()` method to handle the natural logarithm. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue but does not directly address the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but does not closely match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details.",
