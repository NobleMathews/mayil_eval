{
    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a comprehensive and detailed solution to the issue of precomputing the CDF for several distributions in the SymPy library. It aligns perfectly with the git diff by suggesting the addition of `_cdf` methods to the distribution classes, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also provides an example implementation for the `Arcsin` distribution, which matches the git diff's implementation for the same distribution. Furthermore, the RESPONSE suggests adding tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations, which is a crucial step in the development process and is also reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the use of `Piecewise` functions to handle the domain of the distributions, which is a key aspect of the git diff's changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises using SymPy functions such as `lowergamma`, `uppergamma`, `hyper`, and `erf` to express the CDFs, which is consistent with the git diff's approach.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions that would enable a developer to fix the issue effortlessly. It directly aligns with the git diff's approach and offers a valid, effective alternative to the git diff, thus deserving a score of 10.",
