    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method called `validate_directory_name` and modifying the `handle` method in `startapp.py` to call this new validation function. However, the git diff indicates that the existing `validate_name` method in `templates.py` was modified to include an additional parameter to handle both app and directory name validation, and the `handle` method was updated to call `validate_name` with the new parameter. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of extending the existing method but instead proposes creating a new method, which is not as efficient or consistent with the existing codebase. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the correct location for the changes, as the git diff shows that the changes are made in `templates.py`, not `startapp.py`. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of validating the target directory name, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, hence the score of 3.",
