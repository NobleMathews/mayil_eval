{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the `minmax_scale` function to include `force_all_finite='allow-nan'` in the `check_array` call, which is in line with the git diff provided. It also suggests ensuring that the `MinMaxScaler` class's `transform` method can handle NaN values, which is relevant to the issue but not directly addressed in the git diff. The RESPONSE further recommends adding test cases to verify the handling of NaN values, which is a good practice but again not specified in the git diff. The reference to issue #11206 and the suggestion to implement the changes in a new pull request are helpful for context and process but are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets for reference, which could assist the developer in locating the relevant code sections, although the git diff already pinpoints the exact location of the change. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it includes additional suggestions not present in the git diff, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
