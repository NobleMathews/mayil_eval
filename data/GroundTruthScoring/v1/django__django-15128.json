    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests documenting the reason for the assertion in `Query.change_aliases` and replacing the assertion with `assert set(change_map).isdisjoint(change_map.values())`, which is aligned with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE fails to address the key changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of the `exclude` parameter in the `bump_prefix` method and the handling of alias conflicts when combining querysets. The RESPONSE also suggests investigating the commutativity issue with the `QuerySet` OR operation, which is relevant but does not provide actionable steps that align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention the critical changes made in the git diff to prevent alias conflicts, such as the `rhs.bump_prefix(self, exclude={initial_alias})` line, which is a central part of the solution. The RESPONSE's suggestion for further debugging is too vague and does not offer a clear path to resolution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
