    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the relevant files and implementing checks to ensure that `sys.stderr` is attached to a valid file descriptor before calling `faulthandler.enable`. This aligns with the git diff's approach to handling the case where `sys.stderr.fileno()` returns `-1`. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or code change, which makes it less actionable compared to the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests applying a patch referenced as `#8250`, but this is not directly related to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also includes a list of code snippets to check, which are not relevant to the issue at hand and do not provide value in resolving the specific problem described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
