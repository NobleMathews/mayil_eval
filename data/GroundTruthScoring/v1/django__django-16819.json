{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and actionable steps for optimizing migration operations in Django, specifically targeting the reduction of AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations. It suggests modifying the `MigrationOptimizer` class and implementing a method to identify and eliminate pairs of `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` operations that cancel each other out. Additionally, it provides code snippets for the `reduce` method in the `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex` classes to handle the optimization logic.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align perfectly with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a direct modification to the `AddIndex` class by adding a `reduce` method that checks for a corresponding `RemoveIndex` operation with the same index name and returns an empty list if found, effectively canceling out the operations. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader approach involving the `MigrationOptimizer` class and additional logic for handling `RenameIndex` operations, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of reducing AddIndex/RemoveIndex operations, but it does not match the git diff's approach of directly modifying the `AddIndex` class. Instead, it proposes a more complex solution that may not be necessary given the simplicity of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 4, acknowledging the actionable advice provided but recognizing that it does not closely match the git diff.",
