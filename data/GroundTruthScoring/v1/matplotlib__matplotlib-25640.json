    "criteria": "The RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing clipping for contour labels within the axis boundary, which is relevant to the issue described. It provides a code snippet to demonstrate how to apply clipping to contour labels, which is actionable and could potentially help address the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows a change in the 'backend_pgf.py' file where a '_print_pgf_clip' function is called to handle clipping within the PGF backend. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the backend code or the '_print_pgf_clip' function, which is a key element in the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a potential solution, it does not closely match the git diff's approach and is incomplete in addressing the specific backend-related aspect of the issue.",
