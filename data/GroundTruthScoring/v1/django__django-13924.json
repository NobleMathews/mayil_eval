{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are somewhat aligned with the git diff, suggesting a review of the `SchemaEditor.__exit__` method and ensuring it handles deferred SQL correctly. It also correctly identifies the need to check the result of `execute_deferred_sql` before marking a migration as applied, which is in line with the git diff's approach of checking `schema_editor.deferred_sql` before recording the migration.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly suggest modifying the `apply_migration` method to conditionally record the migration based on the presence of deferred SQL, which is the specific change made in the git diff. Instead, it provides a broader set of instructions that include reviewing and potentially modifying the `SchemaEditor.__exit__` method, which is not directly addressed in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to understanding the issue, but these do not directly contribute to solving the problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but lacks the specificity and direct alignment with the git diff that would warrant a higher score.",
