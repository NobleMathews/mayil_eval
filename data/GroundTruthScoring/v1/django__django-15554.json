    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of multiple FilteredRelation objects not generating multiple SQL JOINs.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to provide a viable alternative solution to the issue. The git diff shows changes to the Django ORM's internal query construction methods, specifically adding a new parameter 'reuse_with_filtered_relation' to several methods to handle the reuse of joins when dealing with FilteredRelation instances. The RESPONSE, however, suggests giving unique aliases to FilteredRelation objects and using these aliases in annotations, which is not related to the changes in the git diff. Moreover, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use aliases is not supported by Django's FilteredRelation API, making the advice incorrect and not actionable. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets and does not address the core problem described in the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any meaningful guidance or solution that would assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
