{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of incorrect messaging in Django Formset when `min_num` and `max_num` are equal and both validation flags are set to true. It correctly identifies the need to update the error messages to reflect the condition where an exact number of forms is required. The RESPONSE also correctly points out that changes need to be made in the `BaseFormSet` class within `django/forms/formsets.py`, which is consistent with the git diff provided. The hypothetical solution offered in the RESPONSE is similar in intent to the git diff, aiming to provide more accurate error messages for the specific scenario described in the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff exactly in terms of the specific wording of the error messages and the conditions under which they are raised. The git diff uses 'at most' and 'at least' in the error messages, while the RESPONSE suggests using 'exactly', which is a slight deviation from the git diff but still addresses the core issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
