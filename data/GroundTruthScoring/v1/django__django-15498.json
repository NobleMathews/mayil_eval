    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'was_modified_since' function to handle an empty string for the 'header' parameter by returning 'True' instead of raising a 'ValueError'. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also aims to handle the case where the 'matches' variable is 'None' by raising a 'ValueError'. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made. The git diff adds a check to raise a 'ValueError' if 'matches' is 'None' and removes 'AttributeError' from the except clause, while the RESPONSE suggests a broader change that does not raise an exception for an empty string. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests that the issue is with the 'header' being 'None' or an empty string, while the git diff indicates that the issue is with the 'matches' variable being 'None'. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
