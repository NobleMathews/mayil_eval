    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `collect` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py` to handle the `keep_parents=True` flag correctly. It proposes a recursive approach to populate the `parents` set with all ancestors, which is a valid alternative to the git diff's approach of using `model._meta.get_parent_list()`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's solution of simply replacing `model._meta.parents` with `set(model._meta.get_parent_list())` when `keep_parents` is true. The RESPONSE's recursive solution is more complex and not directly supported by the git diff, but it could still achieve the desired outcome of preserving all parent reverse relationships. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, which could be helpful for the developer. However, the RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's simpler and more concise solution, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
