{
    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `IndexedBase.__new__` method to include a check to see if `label` is an instance of `Symbol` before converting it to a `Symbol` using its name. However, this suggestion does not align with the git diff provided, which shows that the correct fix involves passing the `assumptions` to the `Symbol` constructor when `label` is a string, and removing the line that unnecessarily recreates the `Symbol` when `label` is already an instance of `Symbol`.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to address the key aspect of the issue, which is preserving the type information of subclasses of `Symbol`. Instead, it suggests an approach that would still result in the loss of type information for subclasses, as it does not incorporate the `assumptions` or handle the subclass correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE is given a score of 1 because it does recognize the need to modify the `IndexedBase.__new__` method, which is relevant to the issue. However, the proposed solution is not effective and does not align with the git diff, thus it is not actionable in its current form.",
