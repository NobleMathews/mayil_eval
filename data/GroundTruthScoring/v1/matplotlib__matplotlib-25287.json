    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE instructs the developer to locate the `axis.py` file and modify the color assignment logic to use `ytick.labelcolor` and `xtick.labelcolor` instead of `ytick.color` and `xtick.color`, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to only override the color if the labelcolor is not set to 'inherit', which is consistent with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE provides an example modification that is effectively the same as the git diff, with the only difference being the use of `set_color` method instead of directly setting the `color` attribute. This alternative method of setting the color is valid and would achieve the same result. The RESPONSE also includes a reminder to apply similar changes for the x-axis and to test the changes, which are good practices but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that would enable the developer to fix the issue effectively.",
