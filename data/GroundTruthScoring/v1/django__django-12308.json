    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `display_for_field` function to handle `JSONField` correctly when it's read-only, which aligns with the issue description. However, the RESPONSE's approach differs significantly from the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests using `field.prepare_value(value)` to serialize the value to JSON, while the git diff uses `field.get_prep_value(value)` and includes a `try-except` block to handle `TypeError`. Additionally, the RESPONSE introduces checks for a `readonly` attribute and the existence of the `prepare_value` method, which are not present in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes instructions for handling `InvalidJSONInput` in the `prepare_value` method and ensuring the `readonly` attribute is set in the admin configuration, which are not related to the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not closely match the git diff and introduces unnecessary complexity. Therefore, it receives a low score for not providing guidance that is closely aligned with the git diff.",
