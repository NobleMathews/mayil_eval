    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `BaseFormSet._construct_form` method to prevent the delete field from being added to extra forms. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes were made in the `add_fields` method and the `formset_factory` function, as well as related functions in `models.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding a new parameter `can_delete_extra` and using it to conditionally add the delete field to forms based on whether they are initial or extra forms.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `_construct_form` method is not supported by the git diff, and it does not provide a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these do not directly contribute to resolving the issue as described in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of preventing the delete field from being added to extra forms, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a valid alternative solution. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
