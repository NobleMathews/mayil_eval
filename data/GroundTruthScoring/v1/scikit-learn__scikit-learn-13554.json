    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice by suggesting updates to the `_euclidean_distances` function to handle `float32` precision issues. It correctly identifies the need to cast `X_norm_squared` and `Y_norm_squared` to `float64` if they are `float32` to avoid precision loss. However, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff's approach. The git diff includes a new function `_euclidean_distances_upcast` and significant changes to the existing `_euclidean_distances` function, which are not reflected in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests no changes are required in the `_euclidean_distances_upcast` function, which contradicts the git diff that introduces this new function and its implementation. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that does not match the git diff's changes and lacks the detailed modifications and optimizations present in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff.",
