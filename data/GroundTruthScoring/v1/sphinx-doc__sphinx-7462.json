    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the issue described. It incorrectly suggests updating the return type of the `foo` function to `Tuple[()]` instead of `Tuple[()]`, which is a repetition and does not make sense. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a condition to check if the list is empty before attempting to pop from it, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff, but it does not provide any specific guidance or code changes to implement this solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not contribute to solving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable advice or meaningful guidance that would help the developer fix the issue.",
