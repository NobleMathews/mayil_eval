    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying both the Python code in 'contour.py' and the C++ code in '_contour.cpp'. It proposes adding a check for an all NaN array and issuing a warning in the Python code, and modifying the C++ code to handle the all NaN case without triggering an assertion. However, the git diff provided only shows changes to the 'contour.py' file, specifically changing how the maximum and minimum z-values are calculated and handled when the log scale is used. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling NaN values by using 'astype(float)' to ensure proper type conversion. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests changes to the C++ code, which is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of handling NaN values, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
