    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach to improving the `as_relational` method for `Range` in SymPy, which is the issue at hand. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff provided. The git diff suggests a different implementation, which includes removing the import of `Integer`, simplifying the `size` method, and significantly altering the `as_relational` method to handle different cases of ranges, including empty ranges and ranges with infinite bounds. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests adding a condition to check if the step and the modulus of the starting values relative to the step are the same, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `size` method or the handling of empty ranges and ranges with infinite bounds, which are key elements in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using `floor`, which is not present in the git diff's version of `as_relational`. The RESPONSE also fails to remove the unnecessary import of `Integer` as shown in the git diff.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is related to the issue and attempts to address the problem with the `as_relational` method, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a score of 3, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
