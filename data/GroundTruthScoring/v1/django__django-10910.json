    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the usage of `timezone(timedelta(hours=some_hours))` with `pytz.timezone` and modifying the `ExtractHour` function to use the correct timezone format for PostgreSQL. While the suggestion to use `pytz.timezone` is aligned with the git diff's approach of handling timezones correctly, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `_prepare_tzname_delta` method in different database backends and the adjustments to the `_convert_field_to_tz` method. The RESPONSE also provides an example of modifying the `ExtractHour` function, which is not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of incorrect timezone handling but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
