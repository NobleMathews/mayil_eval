    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code snippet for modifying the `CFTimeIndex.shift()` method to accept float values for shifting by non-integer values. It correctly identifies the need to handle float values for `n` when the frequency is days or smaller and to raise an error for non-360-day calendars when attempting to shift by a non-integer number of months or larger units. The RESPONSE also suggests implementing logic to handle the 360-day calendar case, which is in line with the issue description.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff provided. The git diff includes changes to the `BaseCFTimeOffset` class and its subclasses, introducing a new `Tick` class that is used to handle multiplication by floats. The RESPONSE does not mention the introduction of the `Tick` class or the changes to the subclasses of `BaseCFTimeOffset`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests raising a `NotImplementedError` for fractional shifts for the 360-day calendar, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows that the code should handle multiplication by floats directly without raising such an error.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section on updating the documentation and adding tests, which is good practice but not directly related to the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and partially relevant, hence a score of 4 is appropriate.",
