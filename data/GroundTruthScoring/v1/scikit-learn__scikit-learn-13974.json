    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue with the `add_indicator` parameter in the `SimpleImputer` class when used in cross-validation scenarios where missing values are only present in the test data. The suggested solution is to set the `error_on_new` parameter of `MissingIndicator` to `False`, which aligns with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly points out where the change should be made, in the `_fit_indicator` method of the `_BaseImputer` class, which is consistent with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests modifying the `_fit_indicator` method, which is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's solution is effectively the same as the git diff's solution, which is to add `error_on_new=False` to the `MissingIndicator` initialization in both the `_base.py` and `_iterative.py` files. The RESPONSE's alternative approach is valid and would achieve the same result as the git diff, thus it should not be penalized.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to specific code snippets in the sklearn repository that are relevant to the issue, which could be helpful for developers looking to understand the broader context of the problem. This adds value to the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, warranting a high score.",
