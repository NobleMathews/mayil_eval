    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed analysis of the issue and suggests a thorough investigation of the `SlicedLowLevelWCS.world_to_pixel_values` method, which is directly related to the problem described in the ISSUE. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to ensure that the method accounts for the slice offset and reconstructs the full set of world coordinates before transforming to pixel coordinates. It also suggests verifying the handling of cases where the WCS is sliced to a single wavelength, which is relevant to the reported erroneous infinite pixel entry.\n\nThe RESPONSE aligns well with the git diff, which shows changes to the `world_to_pixel_values` method in the `sliced_wcs.py` file. The git diff includes the addition of a line to calculate `sliced_out_world_coords` and a modification to use these coordinates instead of a placeholder value of 1.0. This change is in line with the RESPONSE's suggestion to correctly handle the sliced dimension and ensure accurate calculation of pixel coordinates.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change as seen in the git diff, such as the introduction of `sliced_out_world_coords` and its use in the method. Instead, it offers a more general approach to investigating and fixing the issue. While the RESPONSE does not match the git diff verbatim, it does provide actionable guidance that would lead to a similar outcome, hence the score of 7.",
