    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a validation check in the `ManyToManyField` class `__init__` method to raise a `ValueError` if `related_name` is provided when `symmetrical` is `True`. This is actionable advice that addresses the issue of preventing developers from defining a `related_name` on symmetrical `ManyToManyFields`. However, the git diff provided as the solution to the issue does not raise an error but instead adds a warning in the `_check_ignored_options` method. The RESPONSE's suggestion to raise an error is a more stringent approach than the git diff's warning, which could be considered an alternative solution. However, it does not align with the git diff's approach of issuing a warning, which is less disruptive to existing codebases that may already be using `related_name` with `symmetrical` set to `True`. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in the context of the git diff's chosen solution. It does not match the git diff's approach but offers a viable alternative that could be considered by the developers.",
