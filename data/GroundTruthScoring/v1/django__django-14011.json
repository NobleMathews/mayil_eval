{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `ThreadedWSGIServer` class to ensure proper closure of database connections, which is exactly what the git diff does by adding a `close_request` method that calls `_close_connections()`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to close all database connections before destroying the test database, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a `_close_connections` method.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions that are not present in the git diff, such as reviewing changes made in issue #20238 and considering the use of `NonThreadedLiveServerThread` as a workaround. While these suggestions are potentially helpful, they are not part of the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes to the `features.py` file that are included in the git diff, which adds a test case to the `django_test_skips` method.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable and relevant guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it does not match every aspect of it, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
