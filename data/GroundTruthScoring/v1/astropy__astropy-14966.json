    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not directly address the issue described in the ISSUE section, which is about the loss of unit information when grouping a QTable by a column that contains a quantity. Instead, the RESPONSE focuses on the `group_by` function and related classes and methods without providing a clear solution to the specific problem of preserving unit information in group keys.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests modifying the `group_by` method and related functions to ensure that unit information is preserved, but it does not provide specific actionable steps or code changes that would resolve the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to various parts of the codebase, which could be helpful for a developer to start investigating the issue, but it does not offer a concrete solution.\n\nThe git diff provided shows specific changes to the `astropy/table/groups.py` file, including the use of `represent_mixins_as_columns` and handling of `argsort` with a 'stable' kind. The RESPONSE does not mention these changes or offer an alternative approach that would achieve the same result. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
