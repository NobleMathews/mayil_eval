{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `to_python` method in the `DecimalField` class to handle 'NaN' values, which is a relevant and actionable piece of advice. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of adding a new `validate` method that checks for non-finite values and raises a `ValidationError`. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests raising a `ValueError` directly within the `to_python` method, which is a different approach. While the RESPONSE's suggestion could potentially resolve the issue, it does not match the git diff's solution of extending the validation logic. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that may be helpful for context but do not directly contribute to solving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and provides a partial solution, but it does not fully align with the git diff's approach, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
