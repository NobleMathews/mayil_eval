    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not directly address the issue described or align with the git diff. It offers a general list of ideas that might help the developer get started, but these ideas are not specific or actionable enough to resolve the issue. The RESPONSE does mention checking the `weights` parameter and ensuring it handles sequences, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it fails to provide clear guidance on how to implement the changes, and it does not match the specific changes shown in the git diff, such as the detailed error message formatting and the handling of the `weights` parameter when it is not None.\n\nThe RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests replacing `all(weights)` with the appropriate check, which is not part of the git diff or the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant information about the `random_state` parameter and provides a link to a code snippet that is not directly related to the issue at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
