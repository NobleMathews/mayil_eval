{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking the visibility state of the axes and manually restoring it after calling `ax.clear()`, which is not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by setting the `gridOn` property based on the `mpl.rcParams` settings, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests checking for bug reports or newer versions for a fix, which is a reasonable general troubleshooting step but does not align with the specific solution in the git diff. The workaround suggested, which involves manually removing artists from the axes, does not address the core issue of tick visibility and grid settings that the git diff resolves. Lastly, the RESPONSE suggests switching backends if the issue is specific to the `matplotlib_inline.backend_inline` backend, which is not relevant to the issue described or the git diff solution. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, but it does offer some general troubleshooting steps, which is why it receives a score of 2.",
