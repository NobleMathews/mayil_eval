    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file and method where the issue resides, which is consistent with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's solution. The git diff shows a change in a conditional statement within the `get_constraints` method, whereas the RESPONSE suggests modifying the method to include column order for unique constraints and using the `_get_index_columns_orders` method to parse the SQL definition of unique constraints. This approach does not align with the git diff's solution, which simply removes a condition that was preventing the column orders for indexes from being set for unique constraints as well. The RESPONSE does not address the specific change made in the git diff and instead proposes a different and more complex solution that involves modifying the method and potentially adding new keys to the dictionary, which is not reflected in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
