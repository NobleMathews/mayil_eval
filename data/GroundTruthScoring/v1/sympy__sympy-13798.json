{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to modify the `latex()` function to accept arbitrary strings for `mul_symbol` and use them accordingly in the LaTeX output. This aligns with the git diff, which shows an implementation that allows for custom `mul_symbol` values by handling `KeyError` exceptions and setting the `mul_symbol_latex` and `mul_symbol_latex_numbers` settings based on the provided `mul_symbol` value.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests checking if `mul_symbol` is a string and using it directly, which is a valid alternative to the try-except blocks used in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes but gives a conceptual solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for backward compatibility and the inclusion of tests for the new functionality, which is important for a pull request but not explicitly shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, although it does not provide the exact code changes. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
