    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `_check_readonly_fields_item` method to include the field name in the error message, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the error message should refer to the field name rather than an index, which is consistent with the git diff's change from an index-based label to including the field name directly. The RESPONSE even provides a formatted error message that is very similar to the one in the git diff, with the only difference being the use of 'readonly_fields' instead of '%s' as the label, which is a minor discrepancy and does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes references to code snippets that are relevant to the issue, further aiding the developer in locating where the changes should be made.",
