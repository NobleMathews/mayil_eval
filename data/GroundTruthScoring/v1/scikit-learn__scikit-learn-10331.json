    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of deprecating the default SVC gamma parameter value of \"auto\" and introducing \"scale\". It correctly suggests updating the default value of the `gamma` parameter in the `SVC` class, adding a deprecation warning, and ensuring that the calculation for `gamma='scale'` uses the correct formula. The RESPONSE also advises searching for occurrences of `SVC()` in the codebase to update the `gamma` parameter and updating the documentation and examples, which is in line with the git diff provided.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests using `X.var()` for the calculation of `gamma='scale'`, whereas the git diff uses `X.std()`. This is a minor discrepancy, but it is important to use the correct statistical function for the calculation. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `NuSVC`, `SVR`, `NuSVR`, and `OneClassSVM` classes that are present in the git diff, which are also part of the issue. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that closely aligns with the git diff, it is not complete and has a minor inaccuracy, warranting a score of 7.",
