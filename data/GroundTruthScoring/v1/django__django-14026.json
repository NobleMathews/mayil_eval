    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of supporting a default value for the `Sum` aggregation function and other aggregation functions in Django. It suggests modifying the `Sum` class to accept a `default` argument and using `Coalesce` to provide a default value when the sum is `NULL`, which is in line with the git diff's approach of using `Coalesce` and adding a `default` parameter to aggregation functions. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet demonstrating the proposed changes to the `Sum` class, which is helpful and relevant. However, the RESPONSE does not cover all the changes shown in the git diff, such as the modifications to other aggregation functions like `ArrayAgg`, `JSONBAgg`, and `StringAgg`, and the changes in other files like `statistics.py` and `features.py`. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that aligns with the git diff for the `Sum` function, it does not address the full scope of the git diff, which includes additional aggregation functions and other related changes.",
