    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `id_for_label` method in the `MultiWidget` class to support index-based ID generation, which is contrary to the git diff that shows the method should return an empty string, effectively removing the index-based ID generation. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which removes the conditional logic and simply returns an empty string. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding an `index` parameter, which is not present in the git diff and does not address the issue's request to remove the `id_for_label` method's functionality. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these do not provide actionable guidance relevant to the git diff or the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative or actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
