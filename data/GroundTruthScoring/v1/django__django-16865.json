    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to modify the `makemigrations.py` file to ensure that the `--update` flag respects the `--name` option when creating migrations. The suggested code changes closely align with the git diff provided, which also modifies the logic for generating the migration name to include the custom name if provided. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to check if a custom name is provided and to use it as the base for the new migration name. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests updating the `new_name` variable based on the presence of the `--name` option.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it introduces an additional check for `self.migration_name` and uses a slightly different approach to set `new_name`. However, the RESPONSE's approach is a valid alternative that achieves the same result as the git diff, which is to respect the `--name` option during an update. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code snippet, which is helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses two points because it does not exactly replicate the git diff's approach of using a `name_fragment` variable and the `f-string` formatting for `suggested_name`. However, these differences do not significantly impact the effectiveness of the RESPONSE's solution, and it remains a highly relevant and actionable guide for resolving the issue.",
