{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution to the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to update the `__eq__` method and the `deconstruct` method in the `BaseConstraint` class to account for the `violation_error_message` attribute, which is in line with the git diff provided. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that subclasses of `BaseConstraint` that override `__eq__` also include a comparison of the `violation_error_message`, which is also reflected in the git diff for the `CheckConstraint` and `UniqueConstraint` classes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly suggests that the `deconstruct` method in subclasses should call `super().deconstruct()` to inherit the handling of `violation_error_message`, which is consistent with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe only minor discrepancy is the mention of `violation_error_code` in the `__eq__` method example, which does not appear in the git diff and seems to be a typo or confusion with `violation_error_message`. However, this does not significantly detract from the overall accuracy and relevance of the RESPONSE, hence the score of 9.",
