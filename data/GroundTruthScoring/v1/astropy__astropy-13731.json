    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to identifying and fixing the issue with the `Time` class's string parsing method, which is relevant to the issue described. However, it lacks specific actionable steps that align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the parsing logic and testing the changes, which is a valid approach, but it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as handling the fractional seconds only when the subformat has seconds and skipping the addition of fractional seconds when the subformat does not include them. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue but does not provide direct guidance on how to implement the necessary changes. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content needed to closely match the git diff, therefore it receives a score of 3.",
