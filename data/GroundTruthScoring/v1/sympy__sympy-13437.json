    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new method `_eval_as_leading_term` to the `bell` class to handle the limit as `n` approaches infinity. While this approach could potentially resolve the issue, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff directly modifies the `eval` method of the `bell` class to handle the case when `n` is infinity, returning `S.Infinity` or raising a `ValueError` depending on the presence of `k_sym`. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as handling the case when `n` is negative or not an integer, which are included in the git diff to ensure proper error handling. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of evaluating the limit of the Bell number at infinity, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide a complete or effective alternative to the git diff, as it does not cover all the cases handled by the git diff, and it introduces a new method instead of modifying the existing `eval` method as shown in the git diff.",
