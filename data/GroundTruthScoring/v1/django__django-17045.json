{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and clear guidance on how to implement a system check for unmatched angle brackets in URL patterns, which is the issue described. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `RoutePattern` class in the `django/urls/resolvers.py` file and provides a reference to the existing `_check_pattern_unmatched_angle_brackets` method, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to include the check in the list of warnings returned by the `check` method, aligning with the git diff's approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation of the `_check_pattern_unmatched_angle_brackets` method, but it does not need to, as the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative approach to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE also includes a reminder to test the implementation and write unit tests, which is good practice but not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, thus warranting a score of 9.\n\nThe only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it does not provide the exact code changes shown in the git diff, but it does offer a valid and effective alternative approach to resolving the issue.",
