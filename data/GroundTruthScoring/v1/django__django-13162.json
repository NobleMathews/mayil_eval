{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and detailed implementation steps to improve the default name of merge migrations, which is aligned with the ISSUE's request. It suggests modifying the `makemigrations.py` file to change the filename generation logic, replacing the timestamp with the names of the migrations being merged, and ensuring the filename is not too long. These suggestions are relevant to the ISSUE.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE's implementation details differ from the GIT DIFF. The RESPONSE suggests using double underscores as separators and excluding prefix numbers, which is not present in the GIT DIFF. The GIT DIFF shows a different approach, where it uses a single underscore as a separator and includes a condition to append the timestamp if the combined names exceed a certain length. The RESPONSE's pseudo-code also suggests truncating and appending an ellipsis, which is not part of the GIT DIFF.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially aligned with the GIT DIFF as it addresses the same file and the general idea of changing the naming scheme. However, it does not match the specific implementation shown in the GIT DIFF, and the proposed solution in the RESPONSE is not as effective as the one in the GIT DIFF. The RESPONSE's suggestion to truncate and append an ellipsis could lead to non-unique filenames, which is not a viable solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 4 for offering some actionable advice that is relevant but not fully aligned with the GIT DIFF.",
