    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear explanation of the issue and offers a solution that is closely aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the condition in the `multiset_permutations` function to handle empty lists and suggests yielding an empty list and returning when the input is empty or when `size` is less than 1. This matches the intent of the git diff, which also modifies the condition to handle empty lists and yield `[]` when appropriate.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for test cases in `test_iterables.py` to check that `multiset_permutations` returns `[[]]` for an empty input and `[]` for an empty input with `size` set to 1, which is in line with the git diff's addition of test cases.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests placing the condition at the beginning of the function, which is not explicitly indicated in the git diff. The git diff modifies an existing condition rather than adding a new one at the start of the function. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a code snippet that is not an exact match to the git diff but achieves the same result. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the issue at hand, which could potentially distract from the specific fix required.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns with the git diff, but it includes some unnecessary information and does not exactly match the git diff's approach. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
