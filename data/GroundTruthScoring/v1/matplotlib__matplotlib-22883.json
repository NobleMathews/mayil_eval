    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by instructing the developer to locate the file `lib/matplotlib/tri/tripcolor.py` and specifically go to line 87 to add the missing `f` prefix to enable variable interpolation. This advice is relevant to the issue, which is about missing `f` prefixes on f-strings. However, the RESPONSE does not address the full scope of the git diff provided. The git diff shows that there are multiple changes needed, including changing a `ValueError` to a `TypeError`, updating the error message, and changing `_api.warn_external` to `_api.warn_deprecated` with an updated deprecation message. The RESPONSE only focuses on the aspect of adding the `f` prefix and does not mention the other changes that are part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the full issue.",
