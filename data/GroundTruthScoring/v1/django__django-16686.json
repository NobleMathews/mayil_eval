    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the developer should correct a typo in the field name used in the `values()` method, which is a reasonable suggestion but does not address the core issue described in the ISSUE. The ISSUE is about the error message not mentioning annotations as valid choices when resolving errors, not about a typo in the field name.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide guidance on modifying the error message to include annotations as valid choices, which is the main point of the ISSUE. The git diff shows that the error message has been updated in the `set_values` method to include a check for annotations and raise a `FieldError` with a message that mentions annotations explicitly. The RESPONSE fails to mention any changes to the error message or the logic around it.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some code snippets to check, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer looking to understand the context of the issue. However, these snippets do not directly address the changes needed to fix the issue as shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the use of the `values()` method and annotations, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff and does not provide a solution to the specific issue described.",
