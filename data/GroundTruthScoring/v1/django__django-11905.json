{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `IsNull` lookup class to enforce boolean values for the `rhs` parameter and modifying the `as_sql` method to raise a `ValueError` if `self.rhs` is not a boolean. This aligns with the git diff's intention to prevent the use of non-boolean values with the `__isnull` lookup. However, the RESPONSE does not include the deprecation warning that is present in the git diff, which is a significant part of the solution as it provides a transition period before the hard enforcement of the boolean value requirement. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests immediately raising a `ValueError`, which is a more aggressive approach than the git diff. The RESPONSE is actionable and relevant but does not fully match the git diff's approach, which includes a deprecation warning. Therefore, it scores a 7 for closely aligning with the git diff's intention but not including the deprecation warning.",
