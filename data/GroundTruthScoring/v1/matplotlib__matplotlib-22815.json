    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is relevant to the issue of making dynamically generated norm classes picklable. It suggests modifying the `make_norm_from_scale` function and updating the `__reduce__` method, which aligns with the git diff's approach to implementing a `__reduce__` method. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for the dynamically generated norm class to be accessible by a global name or stored in a global scope, which is a concept related to the git diff's addition of importlib and the use of `getattr` to check if the class is toplevel-accessible. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed instructions that match the git diff. It also suggests caching the dynamically generated norm class and ensuring that the `__reduce__` method returns all necessary state, which are not part of the git diff or necessary for the issue at hand. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the precision and full alignment with the git diff, which is why it scores a 3.",
