    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of `xr.where` not preserving attributes. It suggests modifying the `where` function to accept a `keep_attrs` parameter and pass it to `apply_ufunc`, which aligns with the git diff's addition of the `keep_attrs` parameter and its handling within the function. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to set a default value for `keep_attrs` and suggests setting it to `True` to preserve attributes by default, which is a reasonable alternative to the git diff's approach of using `_get_keep_attrs(default=False)` to determine the default behavior. Additionally, the RESPONSE addresses the dtype change issue by suggesting the use of `.astype()` to ensure the result's dtype matches the input `x`'s dtype, which is not covered in the git diff but is relevant to the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not include the specific lambda function used in the git diff to handle the `keep_attrs` parameter, which is a minor omission but does not significantly detract from the overall relevance and utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
