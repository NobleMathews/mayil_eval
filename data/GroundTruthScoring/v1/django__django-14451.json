    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary changes to implement support for self-closing tags in syndication feeds, which is the issue at hand. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `SimplerXMLGenerator` initialization in both the `RssFeed` and `Atom1Feed` classes within `django/utils/feedgenerator.py` by adding the `short_empty_elements=True` argument. This matches the git diff provided, which shows the exact same changes. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides code snippets and a clear explanation of where and how to implement the changes, which is highly relevant and actionable for the developer. The RESPONSE also includes links to the code snippets for further reference, which is helpful for locating the code that needs to be modified. Overall, the RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and provides a clear, actionable solution to the issue.",
