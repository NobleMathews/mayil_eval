    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. Instead, it suggests using a function called `_solve_linear` which is not mentioned in the git diff. The git diff shows a manual approach to solving the linear equation by differentiating, isolating terms, and using `factor_terms`, `expand_mul`, and `cancel` from the sympy library. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to `dsolve` instead of `solve`, which is not relevant to the issue or the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes suggested in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not help the developer fix the issue as described and does not align with the git diff.",
