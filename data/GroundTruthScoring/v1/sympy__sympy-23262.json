    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_print_Tuple` method in the `PythonCodePrinter` class to handle single-element tuples correctly. However, the git diff indicates that the actual change needed was in the `lambdify.py` file, specifically in the `_recursive_to_string` function. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves correcting the representation of the tuple in the string conversion process rather than modifying the tuple printing method.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the same problem of correctly printing single-element tuples. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE suggests an alternative location and method to fix the issue, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's approach, as it does not address the correct part of the code that needs to be changed according to the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some insight into the issue by identifying that single-element tuples need to be printed with a trailing comma, but it fails to guide the developer to the correct location and method to fix the issue as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
