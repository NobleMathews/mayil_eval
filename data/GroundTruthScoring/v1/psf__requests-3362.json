    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)` returning bytes instead of unicode strings when the response's encoding isn't set or determined correctly. It aligns with the git diff in that it suggests setting the encoding explicitly using `response.apparent_encoding` before iterating over the content, which is similar to the git diff's approach of assigning `encoding` before attempting to decode the iterator.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the error handling for LookupError and TypeError, nor does it suggest raising a UnicodeError. However, it does provide a viable alternative to the git diff by suggesting the use of `response.apparent_encoding` to ensure the encoding is set, which is a valid and effective solution within the constraints developers might face.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides actionable advice and a code example that would help developers understand how to apply the suggested fix. It is relevant and would likely lead to a resolution of the issue described, even though it does not include the additional error handling present in the git diff.",
