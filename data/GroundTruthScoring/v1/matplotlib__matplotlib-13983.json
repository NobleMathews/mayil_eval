    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of investigative steps and verifications that are somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to investigate the handling of tick formatter and locator for shared axes and the updating of the `isDefault_majloc` flag. However, it does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the conditional checks for `isDefault_majfmt`, `isDefault_majloc`, `isDefault_minfmt`, and `isDefault_minloc` before setting the formatters and locators. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the issue or the git diff, which could lead the developer away from the correct solution. The RESPONSE does not provide the clear, actionable steps found in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `_reset_loc_form` function, which are crucial for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks the necessary actionable content to effectively address the issue.",
