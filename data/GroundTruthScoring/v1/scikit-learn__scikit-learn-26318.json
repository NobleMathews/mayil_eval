    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the issue with the `warm_start` behavior in `RandomForestRegressor` and other `BaseForest` derived classes, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a clear or actionable solution to the problem described. It suggests recomputing the OOB score if `self.oob_score` is `True` when `n_more_estimators` is set to 0, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's approach to checking the `self.oob_score` and `n_more_estimators` conditions. However, the RESPONSE fails to include the additional condition `or not hasattr(self, \"oob_score_\")` that is present in the git diff, which is crucial for determining when to recompute the OOB score. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests a method `_set_oob_score_and_attributes` that does not exist in the git diff and does not provide a direct solution to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for context but do not offer a direct fix. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and precision needed to closely match the git diff.",
