    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue of the KeyError being thrown when the 'module' key is not present. It suggests checking the `merge_typehints` function for proper handling of the missing key, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a try-except block to handle the KeyError. The RESPONSE also advises ensuring compatibility with Python 3.5.6 and verifying the `autodoc_typehints` configuration, which are sensible suggestions given the environment info provided in the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating Sphinx or applying a patch if the issue persists, which are reasonable alternative solutions. The RESPONSE does not directly suggest the try-except block as in the git diff, but the advice to check for proper handling of the missing key is in line with the git diff's solution. The provided code snippets are also relevant to the issue and could help the developer in diagnosing the problem.",
