    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `stringify_annotation` function in `sphinx/util/typing.py` to handle PEP 585 generic types correctly. It aligns with the git diff in that it addresses the issue of PEP 585 type hints not being rendered correctly. However, the RESPONSE suggests checking for `__origin__` and `__args__` attributes and formatting the annotation using new style generics, which is not present in the git diff. The git diff suggests a simpler approach by checking for the `__args__` attribute and using `repr(annotation)` if it exists, otherwise using `annotation.__qualname__`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to check for `__origin__` and to format the string representation manually is more complex and not aligned with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it aims to solve the same issue but does so with a different and more complex method that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 for providing some actionable advice that partially matches the git diff but is incomplete in terms of the simplicity and directness of the solution provided in the git diff.",
