    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `to_number_field` function to adjust the minimal polynomial when the sign of the generator is determined. This is not aligned with the git diff, which shows that the sign adjustment code is being removed from the `AlgebraicNumber` class in `numbers.py`. The RESPONSE does not address the actual change in the git diff, which is the removal of the sign adjustment code, and instead proposes an alternative solution that involves modifying a different function (`to_number_field`) and recomputing the minimal polynomial.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described, which is about the incorrect minimal polynomial due to the sign of the generator not being considered. The git diff indicates that the preferred solution is to remove the code that changes the sign of the generator, thus avoiding the need to adjust the minimal polynomial. The RESPONSE's suggestion to recompute the minimal polynomial is not necessary according to the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about the need to ensure the minimal polynomial is correctly computed, which is somewhat related to the issue. However, it fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it offers a somewhat relevant but not actionable solution in the context of the git diff.",
