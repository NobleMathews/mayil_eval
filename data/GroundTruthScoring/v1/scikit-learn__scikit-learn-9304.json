    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `predict` method in the `Pipeline` class to handle the `return_std` parameter by forwarding it to the final estimator's `predict` method. This aligns with the issue's description, which is about the `predict` method not allowing the `return_std` option. However, the RESPONSE focuses on handling a specific parameter (`return_std`) rather than making the `predict` method accept arbitrary keyword arguments, which is what the git diff does by adding `**predict_params` to the method signature.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly align with the git diff, which introduces a more general solution by allowing any additional keyword arguments to be passed through to the final estimator's `predict` method. The git diff does not specifically mention or handle `return_std`, but instead, it provides a way to pass any additional parameters, which would include `return_std` among others.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant because it addresses the issue of additional parameters in the `predict` method, but it is incomplete as it does not provide the flexibility shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE's approach of checking for the `return_std` parameter specifically is less flexible and not as maintainable as the git diff's approach, which would not require changes if new parameters were introduced in the future.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide actionable advice and could potentially resolve the issue for the `return_std` parameter, but it does not offer a solution that is as robust or general as the one in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
