    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the `HasKey` lookup for `JSONField` in Django when using SQLite and acknowledges that numeric keys are not being found. It suggests modifying the `HasKeyLookup` class's `compile_json_path_final_key` method and the `as_sqlite` method in the `HasKey` class to handle numeric keys as strings, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff introduces a new class `HasKeyOrArrayIndex` and modifies the `compile_json_path_final_key` method to handle numeric keys differently, which is not reflected in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests registering the `HasKey` lookup for the `JSONField`, which is not part of the git diff and does not seem necessary for the issue at hand.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides some relevant information but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `HasKeyOrArrayIndex` class and the specific modifications to the `compile_json_path_final_key` method. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not provide a viable alternative to the git diff.",
