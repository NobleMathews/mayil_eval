    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that directly aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` class's `id_for_label` method to return `None`, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE goes further to ensure that the template does not include a 'for' attribute in the label element when rendering the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget, which is a relevant and necessary step to fully address the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer to locate the code that needs to be changed. The RESPONSE is precise, actionable, and effectively resolves the issue of the label pointing to a non-labelable element.",
