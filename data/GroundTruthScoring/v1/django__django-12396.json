    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `DATABASES` configuration to include a `TEST` dictionary with the `NAME` key for both 'default' and 'other' databases, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to the Django core files to handle the database checks and connections properly, rather than altering the `DATABASES` configuration or the test runner's behavior.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `DiscoveryRunner.setup_databases` and `create_test_db` methods, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff does not modify these methods but instead passes the `databases` parameter through various functions to ensure that checks are run only for the specified databases.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that the `check` management command only runs for databases used in the test suite and to consider adding permissions for the 'test_django' user. These suggestions are not relevant to the git diff, which solves the problem by modifying the internal handling of database connections during checks.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The git diff does not involve the files mentioned in the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff. It provides some general advice on handling test databases in Django, which is tangentially related to the issue but does not address the specific changes needed to resolve the problem as per the git diff.",
