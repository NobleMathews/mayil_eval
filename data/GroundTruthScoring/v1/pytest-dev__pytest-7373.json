    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or provides a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the cache key and updating the `cached_eval` function to include the item's globals, which is a different approach from the git diff. The git diff removes the caching mechanism entirely and replaces it with a new function `compiled_eval` that does not use caching. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of removing caching and instead suggests an alternative that still involves caching. While the RESPONSE's suggestion could potentially address the issue of incorrect caching, it does not match the git diff's solution and does not provide a clear, actionable path to implement the changes. The RESPONSE also fails to recognize that the git diff has removed the `cached_eval` function entirely. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of caching but does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's removal of caching. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
