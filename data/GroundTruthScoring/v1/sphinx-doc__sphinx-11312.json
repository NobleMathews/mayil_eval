    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as being related to non-deterministic ordering of sets in documentation output, which is correct. It suggests modifying the `util.inspect.object_description` function to ensure that sets are converted to sorted lists before generating their string representation, which is a reasonable approach to achieving deterministic ordering. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff includes a more comprehensive solution that handles not only sets but also dicts, frozensets, tuples, and lists, and introduces a mechanism to avoid infinite recursion by tracking seen objects. The RESPONSE's solution is limited to sets and does not address the recursion issue or other data types. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the 'get_stable_hash' function, which is not mentioned in the git diff and may not be relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore receives a low score.",
