{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_cull' method in 'db.py' to include a check for 'None' before attempting to use 'last_cache_key' in a subscript operation. This aligns closely with the git diff, which also adds a check to ensure 'last_cache_key' is not 'None' before proceeding with the 'DELETE' SQL command. The RESPONSE's code snippet is slightly different in syntax but achieves the same result as the git diff, which is to prevent the 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable error by adding a conditional check. The RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for context, although this does not directly impact the score. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's syntax, but it offers a valid, effective alternative to the git diff, hence the score of 9.",
