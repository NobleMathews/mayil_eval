    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to check if the `heatmap` function properly handles the `norm` parameter when set to `None` and to ensure that `vmin` and `vmax` are considered. It also proposes a code change to handle the `norm` parameter, which is in line with the issue description. However, the proposed code change does not match the git diff provided. The git diff suggests a simpler fix by modifying the condition to check if `norm` is in `kws` to checking if `kws.get(\"norm\")` is `None`. The RESPONSE suggests a more complex change involving the creation of a `norm` object, which is not necessary according to the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix required. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not align closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
