    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to verify the implementation of the `with_H0` function and to ensure that the `h100_val_unit` calculation reflects the inverse relationship between `h` and the distance in `Mpc`. However, the RESPONSE's proposed code change does not match the git diff. The git diff suggests changing the calculation to `100/(H0.to_value((si.km/si.s)/astrophys.Mpc)) * astrophys.littleh`, while the RESPONSE suggests `((H0.to_value((u.km / u.s) / u.Mpc)) / 100 * littleh)`, which is not the same and does not address the issue correctly. The RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets, which could be helpful for the developer to understand the context, but the main solution proposed is not aligned with the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and offers incomplete advice.",
