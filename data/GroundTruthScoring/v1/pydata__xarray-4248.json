    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan for how to show units in the dataset overview by modifying the `xarray` library's representation functions. It suggests changes to the `summarize_variable` function and the HTML representation, as well as the need to update documentation and tests. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which adds a check for a custom `_repr_inline_` method in the `inline_variable_array_repr` function. The RESPONSE does not mention this method or the specific function that was modified in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the feature request of showing units, it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it only partially addresses the issue and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
