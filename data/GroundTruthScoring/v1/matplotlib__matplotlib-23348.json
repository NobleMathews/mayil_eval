    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `MultiCursor` class to handle multiple canvases and provides a high-level overview of the changes needed, which are in line with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests updating the `connect`, `onmove`, and `clear` methods to handle events from multiple canvases, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly points out the need for a dictionary to handle multiple canvases, which is present in the git diff as `_canvas_infos`.\n\nThe RESPONSE loses one point because it does not mention the deprecation of the `canvas` parameter and the introduction of the `@_api.deprecate_privatize_attribute` decorator, which are part of the git diff. However, this is a minor omission compared to the overall correctness and relevance of the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also includes additional helpful information about Matplotlib's event handling and the `mplcursors` library, which, while not directly related to the git diff, could be valuable for further research and understanding.",
