{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of converting a list of Astropy Tables to a NumPy array of tables. It suggests creating an empty NumPy array with `dtype=object` and then iterating over the list of tables to assign each table to an element of the array. This approach is effective and relevant to the issue, as it ensures that the tables are stored as objects without any conversion or coercion of data types, which is the core problem described in the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly modify the `__array__` method of the Astropy Table class as the git diff does. However, it achieves a similar result by providing an alternative way to create a NumPy array of tables without triggering the `ValueError`. The RESPONSE's approach is a valid workaround that does not require changing the Astropy library code, which could be beneficial for users who cannot or do not want to modify the library.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the possibility of modifying the Astropy library itself to handle `dtype=object` as an exception, which is what the git diff suggests. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that circumvents the issue, it does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the library code to allow `dtype=object`. This is why the RESPONSE is scored a 7 instead of a higher score.",
