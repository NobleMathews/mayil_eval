    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to receive a score above 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a solution to the issue described. The git diff shows a change in the `runtest` method of the `_pytest/unittest.py` file, specifically handling the `tearDown` method execution when a test is skipped. The RESPONSE, however, suggests reviewing code snippets and issue descriptions, adding checks in the `tearDown` method, and reporting a bug to the pytest team. These suggestions do not address the actual problem of preventing `tearDown` from running when a test is skipped using `--pdb`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to a code snippet that is not relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
