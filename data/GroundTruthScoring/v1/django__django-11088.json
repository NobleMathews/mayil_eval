    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is relevant to the issue, such as modifying the initial migration to use `default=b''` instead of `default=''` for `BinaryField`, ensuring that all migrations use bytes for default values, and updating the `get_default` method to handle the default value correctly. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff, which adds a `check` method and a `_check_str_default_value` method to the `BinaryField` class to validate the default value at the model field level, rather than at the migration level or within the `effective_default` method in `schema.py`. The RESPONSE also suggests checking for other occurrences in the code where `BinaryField` defaults might be incorrectly set, which is a good practice but not directly related to the git diff provided. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers partial guidance but does not match the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
