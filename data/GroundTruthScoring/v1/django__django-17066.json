    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the non-deterministic order of `unique_together` constraints within migrations due to the use of sets. It suggests modifying the `SetSerializer` class to ensure a deterministic order when serializing sets, which is in line with the git diff that also modifies the `SetSerializer` class to inherit from `BaseUnorderedSequenceSerializer` for the same purpose.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides a detailed solution, including a code snippet that shows how to sort the elements of the set before serialization. This approach is effective and relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the `FrozensetSerializer` class and the `writer.py` file, which are also part of the git diff. These omissions mean that the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff, but it still provides a significant portion of the solution.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, showing an understanding of the broader context of the problem. However, these links are not directly related to the solution and thus do not contribute to the score.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable advice that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, but it is not complete as it omits some changes. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
