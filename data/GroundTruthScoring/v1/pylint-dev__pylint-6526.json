    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how Pylint determines the location for storing stat files, which is highly relevant to the ISSUE. It correctly identifies the use of the `PYLINT_HOME` environment variable and the default behavior when it is not set. The RESPONSE also offers a potential reason for why the stat files might be written to the current working directory, which is useful for debugging the issue reported. Additionally, it provides actionable steps to debug the issue, such as checking the `PYLINTHOME` environment variable and inspecting the value of `DEFAULT_PYLINT_HOME` at runtime.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, which involves modifying the `_get_pdata_path` function to strip characters that cannot be used in a filename and to prevent the creation of sub-directories. While the RESPONSE is helpful and relevant, it does not provide guidance on the specific changes to the code that are shown in the git diff. Therefore, it does not fully align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue but still offers valuable information for understanding and potentially fixing the problem.",
