    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `Figure.add_axes` method accepting extra positional arguments that are not documented or expected. It also correctly refers to the deprecation warning added in the git diff for extra arguments. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that calls to `Figure.add_axes` only include the documented parameters and removing any extra positional arguments from calls in the codebase, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes made to `_process_projection_requirements` method signature and the removal of `*args` from several calls to this method, which are also part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable advice, it does not fully match the git diff as it omits some changes that were made. Therefore, it does not warrant a perfect score but is still valuable in addressing the issue.",
