    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue described. It offers general advice on ensuring that 'handle_unknown' is set to 'ignore' and that the 'fit' method sorts and stores categories correctly, which is not directly related to the specific memory handling problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE suggests casting the input data to 'object' dtype to prevent truncation and memory issues, which is somewhat relevant but does not align with the git diff's approach of casting the input array to the same dtype as the categories array when necessary. The RESPONSE does not address the specific change made in the git diff, which involves conditionally casting the input array to the dtype of the categories array to handle different lengths of numpy strings. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
