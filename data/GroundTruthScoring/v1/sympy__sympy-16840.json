    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing input validation to prevent division by zero and to ensure that the code evaluates `S.Half` to its numerical value before performing the division. However, the git diff shows that the actual solution involves handling cases where the operands are infinite or NaN, and special handling for Float types and infinite values in the `__divmod__` method. The RESPONSE does not address these specific changes and instead focuses on a general approach to prevent division by zero, which is not the core issue described. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not offer specific guidance on what changes to make in those snippets. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a low score.",
