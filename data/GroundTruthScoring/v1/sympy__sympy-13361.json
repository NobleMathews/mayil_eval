    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the `evalf` method when used with the `subs` argument and suggests modifying the `evalf` function to handle the `subs` argument correctly. It also correctly points out that the problem seems to be related to precision handling. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or code change that would resolve the issue. Instead, it offers a general approach and points to various code snippets that might be related to the problem. The git diff provided shows a specific change where a return value is replaced with `INF`. The RESPONSE does not mention or align with this change, nor does it offer an alternative solution that would lead to the same result. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant by identifying the problem area, it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff and does not provide a clear solution to the issue.",
