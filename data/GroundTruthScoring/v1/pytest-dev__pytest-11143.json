    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that aligns well with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to review the `AssertionRewriter` class and its `is_rewrite_disabled` method, ensuring that the docstring is checked to be a string before performing iterable operations. This matches the git diff's addition of a type check for the docstring to be a string. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a test case to reproduce the issue, which is a good practice but not part of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact code change, which is why it does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippet checks, which do not detract from the main solution but are unnecessary for resolving the issue.",
