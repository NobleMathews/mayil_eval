    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to remove the use of `pytest.approx()` with sets and to implement a custom comparison function or sort the elements before comparison. This aligns with the git diff's intent to prevent the use of `pytest.approx()` with unordered collections like sets. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the renaming of `ApproxSequencelike` to `ApproxSequenceLike`, the removal of `set` from the `if` condition in `__repr__`, and the addition of a new `TypeError` to handle cases where `pytest.approx()` is used with unordered collections. The RESPONSE also does not mention the import of `Collection` from `collections.abc`, which is part of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the issue of unordered collections, it does not fully match the git diff's approach and is incomplete in terms of the changes needed to resolve the issue.",
