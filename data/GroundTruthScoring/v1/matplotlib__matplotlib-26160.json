{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide precise, actionable guidance and directly align with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and actionable guide for adding setters to the `_AxLine` class, which aligns with the git diff's solution to the issue. The RESPONSE suggests renaming `_AxLine` to `AxLine` to make it public, which is consistent with the git diff. It also correctly identifies the need to enforce the constraint that either `_xy2` or `_slope` can be set but not both, which is in line with the git diff and the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE includes code snippets for the setter methods and a brief explanation of what each method should do, which is very close to the git diff's implementation. It also correctly suggests updating the `get_transform` method to recalculate the transform when `_xy1`, `_xy2`, or `_slope` is updated, although this specific method update is not shown in the git diff, it is implied as necessary due to the nature of the changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not include the getter methods that are present in the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score. However, the absence of getter methods does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the primary issue was the lack of setter methods. The RESPONSE also provides a link to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful for the developer to locate where the changes should be made.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff and achieves similar results, warranting a high score.",
