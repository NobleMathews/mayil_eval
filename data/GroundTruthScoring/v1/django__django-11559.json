    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the problem and suggests several areas of the code to review, including the OrderBy class, OrderableAggMixin, and various sections of sql/compiler.py. However, it does not offer a specific solution or actionable steps that align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a precise change where an expression is checked for the 'resolve_expression' attribute and then wrapped in an 'item.desc()' or 'item.asc()' call based on the 'descending' flag. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, does not mention this specific solution or any similar approach. Instead, it provides a broad set of recommendations that are not directly related to the git diff's approach to the issue. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it discusses the OrderBy object and ordering logic, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
