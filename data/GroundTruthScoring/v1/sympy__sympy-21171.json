    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_print_Function` method in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` and checking for the existence of a custom print method for `SingularityFunction` or creating one. However, the git diff shows that the actual fix was made in the `_print_SingularityFunction` method in the `sympy.printing.latex` module by adding support for the `exp` argument and handling it correctly. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. It incorrectly identifies the location of the change and the approach to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
