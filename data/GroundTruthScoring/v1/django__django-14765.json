    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the `ProjectState.__init__()` method to include an assertion that `real_apps` is a set when it is not `None`. The RESPONSE also correctly places the assertion after the default value is set for `real_apps`. The only minor difference is that the RESPONSE suggests using an inline conditional to set `self.real_apps`, while the git diff uses a separate if-else block. However, this difference does not affect the correctness of the solution and is a matter of coding style preference. The RESPONSE effectively addresses the issue and provides a solution that would resolve it, closely matching the git diff's approach.",
