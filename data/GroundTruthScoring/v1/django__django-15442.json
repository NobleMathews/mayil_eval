{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `mark_safe` function to use the `keep_lazy` decorator, which aligns with the git diff that applies the `@keep_lazy(SafeString)` decorator to the `mark_safe` function. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle lazy objects without forcing their evaluation, which is the core issue described. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating the `__html__` method in the `SafeData` class and the `__str__` method in the `SafeString` class to handle lazy objects, which, while not explicitly mentioned in the git diff, is relevant to ensuring that lazy objects are not prematurely evaluated. The RESPONSE also recommends adding tests and reviewing the proposed solution on the given branch, which are good practices for validating the fix. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or examples, which makes it slightly less actionable than the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8 for its close alignment with the git diff and its relevance to the issue, but with a minor deduction for not providing explicit code changes.",
