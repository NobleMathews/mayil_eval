    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__init__` method of the `UUIDField` class to set a `max_length` of 36 and creating a new `AdminUUIDInputWidget` class with a size attribute of 36. It also suggests overriding the form field for `UUIDField` in the admin. However, the git diff provided does not make any changes to the `UUIDField`'s `__init__` method or create a new widget class. Instead, the git diff modifies the `get_context` method in `django/contrib/admin/widgets.py` to add an additional CSS class to the widget's attributes if the related field is a `UUIDField`. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of the admin foreign key raw inputs being too small for UUID fields, nor does it align with the git diff's approach of handling the issue within the admin widget's context. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not actionable or relevant in the context of the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
