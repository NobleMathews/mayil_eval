    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying a function called `_clone_parametrized` in `sklearn/base.py` to handle dictionary attributes correctly during the cloning process. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to a function with that name or any cloning-related functions. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the `get_params` method in multiple files, adding warning messages and exception handling for attribute retrieval, and a change in the order of operations in the `Pipeline` class constructor.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, as it addresses a different part of the codebase and proposes a solution to a cloning issue that is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff does not suggest that the issue is with the cloning process itself but rather with how parameters are retrieved within the `get_params` method.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that is relevant to the git diff or the issue described, and it does not offer a viable alternative solution. It is not helpful for a developer trying to resolve the issue based on the git diff provided.",
