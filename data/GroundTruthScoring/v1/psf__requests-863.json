    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `Request.__init__` method and the `RequestHooksMixin.register_hook` method to handle lists of hooks. It also correctly identifies the need to handle lists of hook functions and provides a code snippet that attempts to address the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `register_hook` method to handle lists, tuples, and sets by using the `extend` method for iterables and `append` for single hooks. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests raising exceptions for unsupported events and non-callable hooks, which is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests changes to the `Request.__init__` method, which is not part of the git diff. While the RESPONSE's approach could be a valid alternative, it does not closely match the git diff's approach and adds complexity that is not reflected in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and receives a score of 4.",
