    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue as related to pretty printing of vectors in SymPy and mentions baseline alignment problems. It correctly points out that the code for pretty printing vectors is located in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests looking into the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class and `_print_BaseVector` method, which are not part of the solution in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` and `sympy/printing/mathml.py`, which are not relevant to the fix. The git diff shows that the issue is resolved by modifying the `_print_BasisDependent` method to handle newlines and baseline alignment for vectors with fractional scalars. The RESPONSE does not mention this method or the specific changes made in the git diff, such as handling right parenthesis extensions and inserting spaces for parts without newlines. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in identifying the general area of the issue but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
