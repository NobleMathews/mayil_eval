    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement a system check for the uniqueness of names for constraints and partial indexes, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests extending the Django system checks framework, collecting all constraint and index names, checking for duplicates, and reporting errors, which aligns with the general direction of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff shows that the check is integrated into an existing function (`check_all_models`), while the RESPONSE suggests creating a new check function and registering it separately. Additionally, the git diff includes logic for handling errors and assigning unique error IDs (E029, E030, E031, E032), which the RESPONSE does not cover. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets and references to specific lines in the Django repository, which are not directly related to the git diff but could be useful for a developer looking for context. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks completeness and specificity in matching the git diff's approach.",
