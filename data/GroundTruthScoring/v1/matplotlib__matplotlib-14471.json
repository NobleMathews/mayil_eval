    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue, such as reviewing the change log, ensuring proper registration of subclassed `FigureCanvasQT` objects, and manually managing figure creation. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows specific changes to the `matplotlib` library files to handle the backend switch and the closing of figures. The RESPONSE does not offer any actionable changes to the codebase or a direct solution to the problem described in the issue. Instead, it provides general debugging steps and a suggestion to report the bug if it persists. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it acknowledges the issue with the destruction of canvas objects, it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff and therefore does not provide significant value towards fixing the issue.",
