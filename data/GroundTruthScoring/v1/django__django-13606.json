    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to replace the 'NOT IN' implementation with 'NOT EXISTS' in the 'split_exclude' method of the 'sql.Query' class. The RESPONSE also emphasizes the correct handling of NULL values and the correlation of the subquery to the outer query, which are key aspects of the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately reflects the changes made in the git diff, particularly the replacement of 'NOT IN' with 'NOT EXISTS' in the 'split_exclude' method. It also correctly points out the need to ensure proper handling of NULL values and the correlation between the subquery and the outer query, which are essential for the correct implementation of the 'NOT EXISTS' logic.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly mention the removal of the 'is_nullable' check and the addition of the 'ResolvedOuterRef' class, which are present in the git diff. However, these details are implicitly covered by the RESPONSE's instruction to ensure that all instances of 'NOT IN' subqueries are replaced with 'NOT EXISTS' and that the subquery is correctly correlated to the outer query.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a highly relevant and actionable solution that would enable a developer to effectively address the issue. It closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, although it does not explicitly mention every single change in the diff. Therefore, it receives a high score for its utility in assisting the developer to fix the issue.",
