    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `numdecs` parameter entirely from the `LogLocator` constructor and `set_params` method, as well as any references to `self._numdecs` and the deprecation code block. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about the unused `numdecs` parameter. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which instead of removing the parameter, deprecates it using the `_api.delete_parameter` decorator and privatizes the attribute with a deprecation warning. The RESPONSE lacks actionable content in terms of how to properly deprecate the parameter and does not provide guidance on maintaining backward compatibility, which is a key aspect of the git diff's approach. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer a complete or closely matching solution to the git diff.",
