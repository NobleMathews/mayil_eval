    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_filetype` function and adding a new configuration option for file extension preference, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling files with the same name but different extensions. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows changes to the `discover` method in `project.py` to handle the detection of multiple files with the same document name and to log a warning, as well as updates to the logging system to support the 'once' keyword for logging messages only once. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify `get_filetype` and add a configuration option does not match these changes and does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the logging system in the git diff, which are an integral part of the solution to the issue.",
