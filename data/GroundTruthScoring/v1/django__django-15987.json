    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests normalizing `FIXTURE_DIRS` entries to strings before performing duplicate checks, which aligns with the git diff's approach of converting `Path` instances to strings for the duplicate check. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet that shows how to implement the normalization using `os.path.realpath(str(d))` for each directory in `FIXTURE_DIRS`. This is slightly different from the git diff, which uses a list comprehension to convert each directory to a string without the additional normalization step of `os.path.realpath`. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use `os.path.realpath` could be seen as an enhancement to ensure that all paths are fully resolved before comparison, which could prevent issues with symbolic links or relative paths. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff but offers a viable alternative approach to the issue. It provides clear guidance on how to update the `fixture_dirs` method to handle `Path` instances correctly, which is the core of the issue. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear solutions that closely align with the git diff's intent to fix the issue.",
