    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which involves updating the documentation and implementing a negated version of the `brier_score_loss` function. The RESPONSE suggests creating a `neg_brier_score_loss` function and updating the scorer object in `sklearn/metrics/_scorer.py`, which aligns with the git diff's approach of renaming the scorer to `neg_brier_score` and adding a deprecation message to the old `brier_score_loss_scorer`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to update the documentation to reflect the changes, which is in line with the issue's request to correct the documentation in section 3.3.1.1. However, the RESPONSE does not include the specific changes to the documentation text, which are part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the typo correction in the comment within `classification.py`, which is a minor but relevant part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It provides a valid and effective alternative approach to addressing the issue, although it does not capture all the changes in the git diff, such as the typo correction and the specific documentation updates.",
