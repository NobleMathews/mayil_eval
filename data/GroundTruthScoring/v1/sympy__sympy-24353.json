    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the import statement in `sympy/utilities/benchmarking.py` or addressing potential issues with the `py` module version. However, the git diff indicates that the correct solution was to remove the benchmarking functionality entirely from the setup.py file and delete the `sympy/utilities/benchmarking.py` file. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of removing the benchmarking functionality and does not offer a viable alternative solution. Instead, it suggests troubleshooting steps that are not relevant to the actual fix implemented in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as per the git diff.",
