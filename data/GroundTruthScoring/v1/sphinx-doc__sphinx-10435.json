    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests modifying the LaTeX macro definitions for `\\sphinxcode` and `\\sphinxupquote` to include the `%` character at the end of the definition to remove unwanted spaces, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adjusting the LaTeX output to prevent extra spaces. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to test the changes by building the LaTeX documentation, which is an essential step in verifying the fix.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly reference the specific lines of code that were changed in the git diff, such as the adjustment of the `hlcode` variable and the addition of the `%` character in the `self.body.append` method. Instead, it suggests looking in the `sphinx/highlighting.py` file and modifying macro definitions there, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. The git diff modifies the `sphinx/writers/latex.py` file directly, which is the correct location for the fix.\n\nThe RESPONSE is still valuable as it provides a viable alternative approach to solving the issue, even though it does not match the git diff exactly. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify macro definitions could potentially be a valid solution, but it is not the one chosen in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and potential effectiveness, despite the slight misalignment with the git diff.",
