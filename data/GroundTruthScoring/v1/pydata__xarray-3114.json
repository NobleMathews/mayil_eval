    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking and preserving the `WRITEABLE` flag of the numpy array underlying the `DataArray` after calling `expand_dims`, which is somewhat relevant to the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not address the core problem of the `expand_dims` method modifying the numpy array flags and causing unexpected behavior when setting values using `.loc`. The git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves adding a more informative exception when a read-only view is being modified and does not involve changing the behavior of the `expand_dims` method itself. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the exception and providing a clearer error message to the user. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not directly related to the git diff's solution and does not address the issue of the `.loc` method setting all values in the selected inner array instead of a single value. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
