    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a solution to the issue described. The git diff shows specific changes to the draw method in the _base.py file, introducing a new helper function _draw_rasterized to handle rasterization, and modifying the way artists are handled when rasterization_zorder is set. The RESPONSE, however, provides a generic analysis of the problem without actionable steps and suggests checking various parts of the codebase that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the actual fix required. There is no mention of the new helper function or the changes to the handling of artists, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any meaningful guidance to assist a developer in fixing the issue and does not align with the git diff.",
