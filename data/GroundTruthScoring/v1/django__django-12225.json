    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to update the error message to include a hint about specifying `fk_name`. It also correctly identifies that the error message is related to multiple ForeignKeys and provides a code snippet that could be used as a template for the modification. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly directs the developer to look in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` or a similar file, while the git diff shows that the change needs to be made in `django/forms/models.py`. The RESPONSE also suggests checking for the error ID, which is a good practice, but it does not align with the git diff which does not involve changing or checking an error ID. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of improving the error message but fails to identify the correct file and location for the change, and it includes additional steps that are not supported by the git diff.",
