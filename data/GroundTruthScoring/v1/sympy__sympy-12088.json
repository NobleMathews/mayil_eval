    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but does not closely match the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests converting base-10 precision to base-2 precision and ensuring that the Poly constructor is provided with the correct domain, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, which involves specific changes to the codebase to handle precision correctly within the sympy library itself.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking for implicit assumptions in the Poly constructor and using decorators or context managers correctly, which is not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The git diff shows specific modifications to the handling of precision in various parts of the sympy library, such as using the correct precision when creating mpmath objects and ensuring that domain comparisons are done correctly.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides code snippets to check, which could be helpful for a developer, but it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE does not address the key changes in the git diff, such as the updates to the hashing and equality methods in various domain classes, the use of the correct precision when creating mpmath objects, and the simplification of class creation in the mpelements.py file.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but lacks the specific, actionable guidance needed to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
