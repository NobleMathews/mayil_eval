{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE closely aligns with the git diff provided. It suggests modifying the `deconstruct` method in `FileField` to handle callable `storage` and `upload_to` parameters without evaluating them, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to store a reference to the callable `storage` in an attribute, `_storage_callable`, during initialization, which is present in the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE advises updating the `deconstruct` method to return the `_storage_callable` attribute instead of the evaluated `storage` object when `storage` is callable, which is in line with the git diff changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also extends the consideration to the `ImageField` class, which is relevant because `ImageField` inherits from `FileField`. This shows a good understanding of the issue and the inheritance structure of the Django models.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score is that it includes a small amount of additional guidance regarding the `upload_to` parameter, which, while not incorrect, is not explicitly addressed in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall value of the RESPONSE, as it still provides a highly relevant and actionable solution to the issue described.",
