    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests setting `requires_system_checks` to `[Tags.staticfiles]` in `collectstatic.py`, which is not directly reflected in the git diff. However, the git diff does introduce a check for staticfiles tags within the `handle()` method, which is a different approach to achieve a similar goal. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to call `check_finders()` within the `handle()` method, which aligns with the git diff adding a call to `self.check(tags=[Tags.staticfiles])`. The RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure `STATICFILES_DIRS` is checked within the `check()` method of `FileSystemFinder` is not directly related to the git diff, but it is a valid point regarding the overall issue. The RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `--skip-checks` argument, which is a significant part of the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that partially matches the git diff but is incomplete and does not address all changes made in the git diff.",
