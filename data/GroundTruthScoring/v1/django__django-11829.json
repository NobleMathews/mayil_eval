    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to modify the `patch_cache_control` function to handle the `no-cache` directive as a list and to ensure that `no_cache=True` takes precedence over `no_cache=\"foo\"`. The proposed changes are in line with the git diff, which also modifies the `patch_cache_control` function to use a defaultdict for the `cc` variable and to handle the `no-cache` directive appropriately. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to give precedence to `no_cache=True` and to accumulate multiple field-names for the `no-cache` directive.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it does not include the exact code changes shown in the diff. However, the RESPONSE's approach is a viable alternative that achieves the same result as the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by linking to relevant code snippets in the Django repository, which could be helpful for the developer.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score because it does not include the exact changes from the git diff, such as the handling of the `True` value in the set and the construction of the `directives` list. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is valid and effectively addresses the issue, making it deserving of a high score.",
