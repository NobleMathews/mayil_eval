    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview and detailed steps to implement the feature request described in the issue, which includes issuing a FutureWarning and changing the behavior in a future release to add structured `np.array` as a `Column` instead of an `NdarrayMixin`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which shows the actual code removal that is necessary to address the issue. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_init_from_ndarray` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff, and it does not mention the removal of the code block that automatically views structured ndarray as a mixin. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a detailed implementation plan and references to code snippets, which are not directly related to the git diff but could be useful for a developer. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff, hence a score of 4 is appropriate.",
