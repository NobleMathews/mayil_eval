    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting modifications to the `__init__` method in `django/core/management/__init__.py` to handle the `prog_name` correctly, which aligns with the git diff. It also correctly identifies the need to replace `__main__.py` with `python -m django`. However, the RESPONSE suggests additional changes that are not present in the git diff, such as checking if the script is being run on a Windows platform and prepending `./` to `manage.py` if not on Windows. These changes are not reflected in the git diff and are not necessary to resolve the issue described. The RESPONSE also includes a lot of additional information and guidance on further research and implementation, which, while potentially useful, does not directly contribute to resolving the specific issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and the issue, warranting a score within the 4-6 range.",
