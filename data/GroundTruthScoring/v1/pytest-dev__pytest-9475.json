    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `assert_outcomes()` method to set a default value for the `deselected` parameter, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the `warnings` and `deselected` parameters should be made optional (using `Optional[int] = None`) and only checked if they are not `None`. The RESPONSE does not address the issue of backward compatibility in the same way as the git diff does. Instead, it suggests setting a default value of `0` for `deselected`, which does not match the git diff's approach of making the parameters optional and conditionally checking them. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant information about updating documentation and configuration files, which is not related to the code changes required to fix the issue. However, the RESPONSE does correctly identify that there is a backward compatibility issue with the `deselected` parameter, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
