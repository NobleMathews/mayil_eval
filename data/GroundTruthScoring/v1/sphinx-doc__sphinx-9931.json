    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `stringify_annotation` function in `sphinx/util/typing.py` to check the `add_module_names` configuration option and adjust the `module_prefix` accordingly. However, this approach does not align with the git diff provided, which introduces a new configuration option `autodoc_unqualified_typehints` and modifies various functions to respect this new option when generating the string representation of type hints.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention the new configuration option or the changes to the functions that are actually part of the git diff. Instead, it incorrectly suggests accessing the Sphinx configuration in a way that is not supported by the actual Sphinx codebase (`Config.read()` is not a valid method for accessing the configuration in this context).\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the `type_to_xref` function, the `unparse` function, the `format_args` and `format_signature` methods in various classes, or the setup function where the new configuration option is added.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff and does not provide any relevant or actionable guidance that would assist a developer in resolving the issue as described.",
