    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows changes to the 'textplot_str' and 'textplot' functions in the 'textplot.py' file, which include adjusting the height of the plot, rounding the minimum and maximum y-values to a certain precision, and ensuring that the x-axis is drawn correctly at y=0. The RESPONSE, however, suggests looking into the 'plot' function from 'sympy.plotting.plot' and potentially using matplotlib to draw a horizontal line, which is not related to the changes made in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff, nor does it offer a viable alternative solution. It also incorrectly assumes that the issue is with the 'plot' function and suggests using matplotlib, which is not supported by the evidence in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and receives a score of 0.",
