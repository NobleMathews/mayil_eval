    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear guidance and solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the necessary changes to introduce the 'evaluate' keyword argument in both the `MatAdd` and `MatMul` classes, which is the main issue described. It correctly suggests modifying the `__new__` method to accept the `evaluate` keyword argument and to use it to control the evaluation of the expression, which is in line with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to call `canonicalize` on the object when `evaluate=True`, which matches the git diff's approach for `MatAdd` and `MatMul`.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to provide a high-level overview of the changes needed in the code, including code snippets that are very close to the changes shown in the git diff. It also correctly points out that the `canonicalize` function should be able to combine like terms when `evaluate=True`, which is a detail that aligns with the git diff's intent to make `MatAdd` and `MatMul` behave similarly to `Add` and `Mul`.\n\nThe only reason the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score is that it includes additional guidance on checking the `canonicalize` function and ensuring it handles the combination of like terms, which, while useful, is not explicitly part of the git diff. However, this additional guidance does not detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE, as it is still highly relevant and would likely be part of a thorough implementation process.",
