    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general suggestions for improving the handling of complex numbers and expressions in `ImageSet` and related functions. However, it does not offer specific, actionable changes that align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows concrete code modifications to various files within the sympy library, including changes to the `_eval_rewrite_as_floor` method in `mod.py`, error handling in `contains.py`, property adjustments in `fancysets.py`, and updates to function handling in `functions.py` and `intersection.py`. The RESPONSE fails to address these specific changes and instead offers a broad overview of potential issues without concrete solutions. The RESPONSE does mention the `intersection` method and the `diophantine` function, which are relevant to the git diff, but it does not provide the detailed code changes shown in the diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and lacks actionable content, earning it a score of 1.",
