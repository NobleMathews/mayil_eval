    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement a feature that allows Sphinx to automatically insert references to documented base classes in the generated documentation. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a simple addition to the 'restify' function in 'sphinx/util/typing.py' that allows strings to be returned directly, which is a solution to the problem described in the issue. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a more complex modification involving the 'autodoc-process-signature' event and does not mention the 'restify' function or the direct handling of strings. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader topic of linking to base classes in Sphinx documentation, it does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
