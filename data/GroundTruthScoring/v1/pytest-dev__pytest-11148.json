    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice and partially match the git diff but be incomplete or partially relevant to score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff. It suggests general debugging steps that could be applied to any issue involving class attributes and module imports, but it does not address the specific problem of the module being imported twice under import-mode=importlib. The RESPONSE fails to mention the solution of checking if the module is already in sys.modules before re-importing it, which is the key action in the git diff. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references a code snippet that is not part of the issue or the solution. The only reason it does not score a 0 is that it does mention investigating why there are two different instances of the `pmxbot.logging` module, which is somewhat related to the issue of the module being imported twice. However, it does not provide any guidance on how to prevent this from happening, which is the core of the issue.",
