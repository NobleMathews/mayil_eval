    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSE provides clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests two solutions that are in line with the git diff and address the issue described. The first suggestion to rename the migration file is a manual workaround that would resolve the immediate issue but does not provide a long-term solution. The second suggestion to update the constraint name in the `MyModel` class `Meta` to remove dots is a viable solution that would prevent the issue from occurring in the future. This aligns with the git diff, which modifies the `suggest_name` method to replace non-word characters with underscores, thereby preventing problematic file names. The RESPONSE does not directly suggest modifying the Django source code as the git diff does, but the second suggestion effectively achieves the same result by ensuring that the constraint name does not contain dots. The RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers actionable advice that would help in resolving the issue. However, it does not provide the exact solution of modifying the Django source code, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
