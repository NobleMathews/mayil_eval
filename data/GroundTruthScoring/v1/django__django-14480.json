    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and relevant explanation of how to implement XOR support for `Q()` and `QuerySet` in Django, which aligns well with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE outlines the necessary modifications to the `Q` object, the SQL level implementation, and the `QuerySet` methods, which are all reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes handling database backend differences, writing tests, and updating documentation, which are important aspects of the implementation process but not directly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets for the `Q` object and `QuerySet` which are similar to the changes in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not include the specific workaround for databases that do not support XOR (like SQLite), which is addressed in the git diff with a detailed implementation using `Case`, `When`, and `Exact`. This omission is why the RESPONSE does not score a 9 or 10. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, making it very useful for a developer looking to implement this feature.",
