    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a 'copy' parameter to the TfidfVectorizer constructor and implementing logic to handle the copying of data. However, the git diff indicates that the 'copy' parameter is being deprecated and removed, not added or implemented. The RESPONSE fails to recognize that the 'copy' parameter is already present and is being deprecated due to it being unused. The git diff shows that a deprecation warning is being added, and the default value of the 'copy' parameter is being changed to 'deprecated' to indicate that it will be removed in a future version. The RESPONSE does not offer any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to deprecating and eventually removing the 'copy' parameter. Instead, it incorrectly suggests adding new functionality that is contrary to the intended fix.",
