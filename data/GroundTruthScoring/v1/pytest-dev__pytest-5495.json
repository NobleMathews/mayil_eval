    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying a function called `assert_byte_string_equal` which does not exist in the git diff or the issue description. It also suggests implementing a loop to compare bytes and collect ASCII values, which is not aligned with the git diff's approach. The git diff modifies the `_compare_eq_sequence` function to handle byte strings differently by showing their ASCII representation instead of numeric values. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as skipping the 'sides contain one or more items' message for byte strings and formatting the error message to show ASCII representations. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of comparing byte strings, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
