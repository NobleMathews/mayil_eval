    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests updating the `Signer.__init__` method signature to enforce keyword-only arguments by adding `*` before `key=None`. This change is reflected in the git diff, which shows the addition of `*args` and the restructuring of the `__init__` method to handle the deprecation of positional arguments. The RESPONSE also correctly advises replacing the incorrect instantiation of `Signer` with the correct usage of `salt` as a keyword argument, which is in line with the issue description. The RESPONSE does not include the additional warnings and deprecation messages that are present in the git diff, but these are supplementary to the main solution and do not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff, while acknowledging the minor omission of deprecation details.",
