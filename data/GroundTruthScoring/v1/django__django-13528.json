    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring the locale is set correctly and using the `localize` template tag, which is a reasonable approach to address localization issues. However, the RESPONSE does not address the core issue described, which is the incorrect behavior when chaining `floatformat` with `intcomma`. The git diff shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `floatformat` filter to handle grouping by the thousand separator when a specific format is requested. The RESPONSE does not suggest modifying the `floatformat` filter or adding the `force_grouping` functionality, which is the key change in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a solution that would resolve the issue as effectively as the changes shown in the git diff.",
