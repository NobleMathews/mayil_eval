    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking and potentially implementing a 'combine_expression' method in the PostgreSQL backend to handle the XOR connector, which is a reasonable approach to addressing the issue. However, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix was made in the 'django/db/models/sql/where.py' file by modifying the 'as_sql' method to use the 'Mod' function for cases with more than two children. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the 'as_sql' method and using the 'Mod' function. Instead, it suggests an alternative that involves backend-specific changes, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to various code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code, but it does not directly address the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, resulting in a low score.",
