    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ImmutableDenseNDimArray._new` and `MutableDenseNDimArray._new` methods to handle empty lists, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling empty arrays. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in the `ndim_array.py` file, specifically in the `_parse_index`, `_check_index_for_getitem`, and the `f` function, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests setting the shape to `(0,)` and the `_loop_size` to 0 when an empty list is passed, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes in the git diff, such as the addition of a check for the index being greater than `_loop_size`, the correction of a typo in an error message, and the handling of an empty pointer in the `f` function. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only slightly relevant and does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff.",
