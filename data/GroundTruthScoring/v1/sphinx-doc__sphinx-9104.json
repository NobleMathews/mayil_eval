    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue described. The git diff shows a change in a regular expression pattern within the Sphinx Python domain implementation to include the ellipsis ('...'), which is the root cause of the warning. The RESPONSE, however, suggests checking the Sphinx configuration and changing the syntax in the codebase, which are not related to the actual problem. The RESPONSE does not recognize the need to update the Sphinx domain implementation to handle the ellipsis in type hints, which is the solution provided by the git diff. The RESPONSE does mention the ellipsis and its role in the issue, which is somewhat relevant, but it fails to provide actionable guidance that would lead to a resolution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 1, as it is not aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
