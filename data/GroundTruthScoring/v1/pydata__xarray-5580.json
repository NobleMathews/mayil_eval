    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of increasing the default `display_max_rows`.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the default value of `display_max_rows` in the `OPTIONS` dictionary, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff does not modify the default value; instead, it changes the behavior of the `_mapping_repr` function and related functions to handle `max_rows` more flexibly. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as adding the `max_rows` parameter to the `coords_repr` function and modifying the condition to check for `max_rows` being `None`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
