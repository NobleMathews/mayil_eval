{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely matches the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the condition in the `makemessages.py` file to raise a `CommandError` when none of the required flags (`locale`, `exclude`, or `process_all`) are specified. The suggested condition in the RESPONSE is effectively the same as the one in the git diff, with a minor difference in the order of the conditions, which does not affect the functionality. The RESPONSE also correctly advises placing the condition at the beginning of the `handle` method to ensure early failure if the flags are not provided. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes references to relevant code snippets, which would be helpful for a developer looking to understand the context of the changes. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that the RESPONSE includes a slightly different error message than the one in the git diff, but this does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE in assisting a developer to fix the issue.",
