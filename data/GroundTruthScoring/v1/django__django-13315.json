    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `limit_choices_to` parameter uses a `Q` object that does not produce duplicates, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff's introduction of a check to see if `limit_choices_to` is a `Q` object. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to use `.distinct()` on the queryset does not appear in the git diff, which instead uses an `Exists` subquery to avoid duplicates. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for a regression test, which is mentioned in the issue description but not shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the specific implementation shown in the git diff, such as the use of `Exists`, `OuterRef`, and the complex filter construction. The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff's approach to solving the issue.",
