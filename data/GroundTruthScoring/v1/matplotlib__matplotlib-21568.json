    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue described in the ISSUE. The git diff shows a specific change in the code to handle the spacing for a datetime axis when using `usetex=True`, by modifying the `_wrap_in_tex` function in the `matplotlib/dates.py` file. The RESPONSE, however, suggests general troubleshooting steps such as verifying configuration settings, checking the `constrained_layout` option, and handling of the datetime axis with the `dates` module. It also suggests downgrading to an older version of matplotlib or trying a different installation method, which are not solutions but rather workarounds that do not address the root cause of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide links to code snippets that might be related to LaTeX rendering in Matplotlib, but it does not offer any actionable guidance on how to modify the code to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it acknowledges the use of LaTeX and the datetime axis, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The score of 1 is given because the RESPONSE is not completely off-topic, but it fails to provide a solution or meaningful assistance in fixing the issue.",
