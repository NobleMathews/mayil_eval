    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `sync_to_async` wrapper and implementing asynchronous logic directly within the methods, which does not align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the `sync_to_async` wrapper is being used correctly to create asynchronous versions of the existing methods. The RESPONSE also suggests adding the `alters_data = True` decorator, which is already present in the git diff, indicating a misunderstanding of the issue. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of the async methods not calling the correct methods from the related manager, which is the main point of the git diff. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about handling `through_defaults` and other `kwargs`, but this is not the main focus of the git diff, and the RESPONSE fails to provide a clear solution to the actual problem described in the issue.",
