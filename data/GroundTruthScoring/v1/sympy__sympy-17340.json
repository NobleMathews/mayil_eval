    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `Permutation` class constructor to accept a `Tuple` instead of a `list` and to ensure all calls to the `Permutation` constructor pass a `Tuple`. However, the git diff does not indicate any changes to the `Permutation` class constructor or the types of arguments it accepts. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the way the `Permutation` object's properties are accessed (changing from `args[0]` to `array_form`) and a change in the inheritance of the `Permutation` class (from `Basic` to `Atom`). The RESPONSE does not address these changes and instead focuses on an aspect of the issue that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
