    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests extending the OneHotEncoder class to add a new parameter `drop_last` and modifying the `fit` and `transform` methods to implement the `1 of k-1` encoding. While the RESPONSE does address the issue of adding a `1 of k-1` encoding option, it does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the actual implementation involves adding a `drop` parameter that can take on values 'first' or an array, and it includes extensive changes to handle the new functionality, including error handling and adjustments to the `inverse_transform` method. The RESPONSE does not mention these aspects and instead suggests a simpler approach that does not match the complexity and thoroughness of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to add a `baseline` parameter, which is not present in the git diff and does not align with the changes made in the actual implementation. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
