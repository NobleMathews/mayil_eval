{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed explanation of how to simplify the signature of the `DatabaseOperations.execute_sql_flush()` method by removing the `using` argument. It correctly suggests updating the method signature and replacing the usage of the `using` parameter with `self.connection.alias`. Additionally, it advises searching for all occurrences of `execute_sql_flush` in the codebase to update the calls, which is in line with the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly identifies that any overridden methods in database-specific subclasses should reflect this change, which is a relevant point not explicitly covered in the git diff but is important for a comprehensive solution.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention updating the `transaction.atomic` block to use `self.connection.alias` as shown in the git diff, which is a key part of the implementation. This omission is why the RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10. The RESPONSE also includes additional guidance on checking code snippets and running the test suite, which, while not directly related to the git diff, are good practices in general when making such changes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff, with a minor omission.",
