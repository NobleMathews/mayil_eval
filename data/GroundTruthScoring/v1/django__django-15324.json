    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should offer actionable advice that is somewhat relevant but lacks a close match to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a validator to the form to prevent null byte injection and handling the ValidationError in the view. While this approach is somewhat relevant as it aims to prevent the upload of files with null bytes in their names, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff modifies the multipartparser.py file to sanitize the file name by removing non-printable characters, including null bytes, directly in the file parsing process. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use form validation and error handling is a different approach and does not address the core issue of sanitizing the file name during the parsing of multipart form data. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not provide a solution that closely matches the git diff.",
