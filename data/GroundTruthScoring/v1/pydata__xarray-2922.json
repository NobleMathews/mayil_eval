    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a new `_weighted_average` method and adding an `average` method to the `DataArrayWeighted` and `DatasetWeighted` classes. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes related to an `average` method. Instead, the git diff shows the addition of a `weighted` method to the `common.py`, `dataarray.py`, and `dataset.py` files, as well as the creation of a new `weighted.py` file that defines the `Weighted`, `DataArrayWeighted`, and `DatasetWeighted` classes with methods for sum and mean reductions, but not average. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes shown in the git diff. It introduces a new method that is not present in the git diff and does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, which are related to weighted sum and mean operations, not an average operation. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue as described and does not match the git diff provided.",
