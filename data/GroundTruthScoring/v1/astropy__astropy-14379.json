    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new boolean keyword argument, `include_space`, to the `Angle.to_string` method to control whether a space is included between the value and unit. This approach is somewhat aligned with the issue's request for a feature to optionally add a space between the value and unit. However, the git diff does not introduce a new argument; instead, it modifies the existing logic to conditionally add a space based on the format and the presence of certain characters in the unit string. The RESPONSE's suggestion to add a new argument is not supported by the git diff and introduces unnecessary complexity compared to the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the specific conditions under which a space should be added, as shown in the git diff, such as handling LaTeX formatting or checking the length of the unit string. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue's topic but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, leading to a score of 2.",
