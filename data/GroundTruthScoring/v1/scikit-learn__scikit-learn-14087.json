    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies that the issue is related to the handling of the 'refit' parameter when set to 'False' and provides a general direction for fixing the issue by suggesting checks for the 'coefs_paths' array and 'best_indices'. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically addresses the issue by modifying the condition to check for 'multi_class == 'ovr'' instead of 'self.multi_class == 'ovr'' and by adding a condition to handle the 'self.penalty == 'elasticnet'' case, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding a check for valid indices in 'best_indices', which is not part of the git diff solution. The RESPONSE does not mention the changes related to 'self.l1_ratio_' and the handling of 'multi_class == 'multinomial'', which are key parts of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the specific issue described.",
