    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new configuration option to ignore class method signatures and modifying the method signature checking logic in a file that is not mentioned in the git diff (`pylint/checkers/classes/class_checker.py`). However, the git diff indicates that the changes were made in the `pylint/checkers/similar.py` file and involved modifying the `stripped_lines` function to recursively get all functions, including those nested in classes, to ignore their signatures. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it suggests changes to a different file and a different approach that does not match the actual changes made. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of ignoring class methods signatures with the \"ignore-signatures\" option enabled, as it suggests creating a separate option for class methods instead of modifying the existing \"ignore-signatures\" option to include class methods. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff.",
