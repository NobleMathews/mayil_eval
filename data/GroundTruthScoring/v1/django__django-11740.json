    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable steps that are relevant to the issue of missing dependencies when changing a UUID field to a ForeignKey. It correctly suggests ensuring that the `App2` model is defined before it is referenced, checking migration dependencies, and adding a dependency to the `App1` migration file. These steps are in line with the git diff, which adds dependencies to handle ForeignKey changes. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of the `dependencies` variable and the call to `_get_dependencies_for_foreign_key(new_field)`. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes suggestions for using the full import path of the `App2` model and regenerating migrations, which are not directly related to the git diff's approach to solving the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made to the code.",
