    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `check_array` function to raise a `ValueError` if non-numeric data is passed when `dtype='numeric'`. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, which is about `check_array` failing when strings are passed with `dtype='numeric'`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach, which is to add a warning for future behavior change rather than raising an error immediately. The RESPONSE's suggestion to raise an error is a more aggressive change than what the git diff proposes, which could potentially break existing code that relies on the current behavior. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant sections of code, but it does not directly address the git diff's solution of adding a deprecation warning. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
