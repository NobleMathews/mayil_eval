    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a custom `__getstate__` method in the `Subquery` class to handle the pickling process properly, which is aligned with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not accurately reflect the git diff's implementation details. The git diff specifically removes the '_constructor_args' attribute from the state dictionary, while the RESPONSE suggests setting the 'query' attribute to None, which is a different approach and does not directly address the '_constructor_args' attribute mentioned in the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to code snippets for review, which could be helpful for the developer to locate the relevant code sections. However, the RESPONSE's code example is not as precise as the git diff, and it does not directly solve the issue as described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution but lacks the specificity and accuracy of the git diff.",
