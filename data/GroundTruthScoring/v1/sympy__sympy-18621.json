    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking and modifying the `__new__` method in the `BlockDiagMatrix` class to handle single `Matrix` element scenarios. While this is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a change in the `blocks` method, specifically adding `evaluate=False` to the `ImmutableDenseMatrix` constructor call, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not address the actual change made in the git diff and instead suggests a different approach that involves modifying the `__new__` method and potentially changing the return type of the `BlockDiagMatrix` initialization. This approach does not align with the git diff's solution and does not provide a clear, actionable path to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
