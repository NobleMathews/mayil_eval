{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice and partially match the git diff but may be incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the 'is_number' property in the 'Expr' class to handle undefined functions with number arguments, which is relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff shows changes in multiple files, including 'util.py', 'basic.py', 'expr.py', and 'function.py', indicating a broader scope of modifications than the RESPONSE suggests. The RESPONSE's focus on modifying the 'solve' function and the use of 'Indexed' variables is not supported by the git diff, which does not include changes to the 'solve' function or mention 'Indexed' variables. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear or direct solution to the issue as described in the git diff, but it does address the general topic of the 'is_number' property and undefined functions, which is why it receives a score of 2.",
