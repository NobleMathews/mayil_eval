    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the error related to the 'TupleArg' object and the lack of a 'compute_leading_term' method, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of the AttributeError encountered during the series expansion of the `hyper` function. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding an `_eval_nseries` method to the `hyper` class in the `hyper.py` file, which handles the series expansion when the argument of the hypergeometric function approaches zero. The RESPONSE suggests implementing a `compute_leading_term` method in the `TupleArg` class or investigating the logic that calls this method on a `TupleArg` object, which is not supported by the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution that would resolve the issue in the same way as the git diff, nor does it provide a viable alternative approach. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
