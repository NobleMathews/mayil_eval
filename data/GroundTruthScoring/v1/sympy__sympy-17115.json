    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that all conditions in the `Piecewise` function are converted to sets properly and to modify the `_solve_relational` function to handle the conversion of relational expressions into sets correctly. It also recommends checking for the use of `Union` and reviewing the `Piecewise.eval` method to ensure it can handle compound logical expressions involving inequalities and set membership.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided shows that the actual fix implemented was to raise a `NotImplementedError` in the `as_set` method of the `Contains` class. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or anything similar. Instead, it suggests a broader review and potential modifications of the `Piecewise` implementation, which does not directly align with the specific change made in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader context of the issue, which is the handling of conditions within `Piecewise`. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score for its partial relevance but lack of alignment with the git diff.",
