    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to update the `protocol` attribute in the `Sitemap` class to default to \"https\" and to ensure that the `get_protocol` method reflects this change. It also correctly advises planning a deprecation timeline and updating documentation, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of a deprecation warning.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not include the addition of the deprecation warning using `warnings.warn` and the `RemovedInDjango50Warning` class, which is a key part of the git diff. Instead, it suggests directly changing the default value of the `protocol` attribute to \"https\", which is not the approach taken in the git diff. The git diff maintains the current default but adds a warning about the upcoming change.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that does not match the git diff, as it omits the deprecation warning and suggests an immediate change to the default protocol. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets for review, which is helpful but not directly related to the implementation of the fix.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in terms of the broader goal of transitioning to a default protocol of \"https\" but lacks the specific implementation details present in the git diff, such as the deprecation warning.",
