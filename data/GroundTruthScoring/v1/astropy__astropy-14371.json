    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code changes that closely align with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the function signature to include the `atol` parameter with a default value of `None` and using the maximum precision of the matrix `dtype` if `atol` is not provided. The RESPONSE also correctly advises on the use of `np.isclose` with the determined `atol` value to check if the matrix is in the O(3) group.\n\nThe RESPONSE matches the git diff in adding the `atol` parameter to both `is_O3` and `is_rotation` functions, including the logic to determine the default `atol` value based on the matrix's dtype. It also correctly updates the `np.isclose` calls to use the new `atol` parameter.\n\nThe only minor discrepancy is that the RESPONSE suggests using `np.finfo(matrix.dtype).eps` as the default `atol` for floating dtypes, while the git diff uses `np.finfo(matrix.dtype).eps * 5`. This slight difference does not significantly impact the utility of the RESPONSE, as it still achieves the same result as the git diff and provides a valid, effective alternative.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly actionable and relevant, providing clear instructions that would enable a developer to fix the issue effectively.",
