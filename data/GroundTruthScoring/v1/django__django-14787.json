{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of the `partial` object not having the necessary function attributes like `__name__` and `__module__`. It suggests using `update_wrapper` to update the `partial` object with the attributes of the original function, which is in line with the git diff's approach of using `wraps` to achieve the same goal. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to preserve the attributes of the original function when using `method_decorator`. However, the RESPONSE suggests additional steps that are not present in the git diff, such as using `update_wrapper` separately and copying attributes from decorators to the wrapper function. These additional steps are not necessary according to the git diff, which only adds the `wraps` decorator to the `partial` object. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a solution that would likely work, it includes extra steps that are not reflected in the git diff. This warrants a score of 7, as it offers a slightly different but still effective approach to solving the issue.",
