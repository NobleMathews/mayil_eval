    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `diophantine` function producing different results based on the order of symbols in `syms` when `permute` is set to `True`. The suggested solution involves modifying the permutation handling logic to ensure all permutations of the symbols are considered, which aligns with the intent of the git diff to fix the issue of incomplete results. However, the RESPONSE proposes a new implementation using `itertools.permutations` which is not present in the git diff. The git diff shows a simpler fix by adding the `permute=permute` argument to the recursive call of `diophantine` within the existing set comprehension. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach and adds complexity that may not be necessary. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff, which could be misleading. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers a more complex alternative solution.",
