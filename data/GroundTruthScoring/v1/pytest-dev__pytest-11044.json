    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which involves updating the `_pytest/config/__init__.py` file to include a check for when `testpaths` glob patterns yield no results and to emit a warning in such cases. The RESPONSE suggests implementing a function to check the glob patterns and emit a warning, which is in line with the git diff that adds a warning when no files are found in `testpaths`. The RESPONSE also correctly maintains the default behavior of pytest when `testpaths` is not specified or yields no results, which is consistent with the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff adds the warning directly within the `parse` method, while the RESPONSE suggests creating a separate function to handle the warning. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to update the documentation, which is not part of the git diff but is relevant to the issue as it addresses the second point of surprise mentioned.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section on checking code snippets, which is not directly relevant to the solution and does not provide additional value in the context of the git diff. This part of the RESPONSE does not detract from the overall utility of the solution provided but does not contribute to it either.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a viable alternative to the git diff that would effectively resolve the issue, with some differences in implementation approach and additional suggestions that are relevant but not part of the git diff.",
