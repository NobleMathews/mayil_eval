{
    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue and suggests areas of the code to review, such as the `Query` class and `NegatedExpression` and `F` classes. It correctly identifies that the problem is related to the handling of `exclude` with `F` expressions and the generation of SQL for negated conditions, which aligns with the issue description.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff. The git diff shows changes in the `build_filter` method within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, specifically addressing the condition when `lookup_type` is not 'isnull' and handling nullable fields in the SQL WHERE clause. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the logic behind them.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which could be helpful for a developer to locate the relevant sections of the codebase. However, these links are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff, and the RESPONSE does not provide clear instructions on what changes to make in the code.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
