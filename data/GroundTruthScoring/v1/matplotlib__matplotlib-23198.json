    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests standardizing the argument names across functions and methods to resolve the inconsistency in argument naming (`ncols` vs `ncol` and `nrows` vs `nrow`). However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff shows that the code is being updated to use `ncols` consistently and to maintain backward compatibility by allowing the use of `ncol` but discouraging it. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests changing `subplots` to use `nrows` instead of `ncols` and `nrows`, which is not relevant to the issue, and it also suggests updating the `legend` method to use `ncol` instead of `ncols`, which is the opposite of what the git diff does. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the inconsistency issue. The RESPONSE does mention updating calls to `plt.subplots` and `axis.legend` to use the updated argument names, which is somewhat relevant but does not align with the git diff's solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet to check, which is relevant to the issue, but it does not offer a clear solution or guidance on how to address the inconsistency.",
