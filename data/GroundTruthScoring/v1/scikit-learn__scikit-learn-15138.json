    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new boolean parameter `use_features_in_secondary` to the `StackingRegressor` and `StackingClassifier` classes, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of adding an option to use the original dataset when training the `final_estimator`. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which introduces a `passthrough` parameter instead of `use_features_in_secondary`. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `_fit` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff, and the changes to the `_concatenate_predictions` method do not match the git diff's approach of handling sparse data and using `np.hstack` or `sparse.hstack` depending on the data type.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It does not mention the need to import `scipy.sparse` or handle the concatenation of predictions with the original dataset in a way that respects the data's sparsity. Additionally, the RESPONSE's code snippet does not reflect the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the correct placement and handling of the `passthrough` parameter. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff, warranting a score of 3.",
