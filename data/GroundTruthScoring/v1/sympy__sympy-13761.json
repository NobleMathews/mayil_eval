    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding an entry for the `sinc` function in the `fmap` dictionary within the `fu.py` file to handle expressions involving `sinc` during simplification. This is somewhat relevant as it addresses the KeyError involving the `sinc` function. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable changes that align with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by changing the superclass of the `sinc` class from `TrigonometricFunction` to `Function`, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also does not provide specific details on what the simplification rule or transformation function should be, making it lack actionable content. The provided code snippets are relevant for understanding where the `sinc` and `csch` functions are defined but do not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
