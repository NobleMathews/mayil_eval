    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is relevant to the issue of getting an inverted matrix with sympy and numpy. It suggests ensuring that the 'lambdify' function is provided with the correct modules argument to handle matrix inversion with 'numpy', which is aligned with the git diff that includes changes to the 'lambdify' function to import the necessary 'numpy.linalg' functions. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to match the dimensions of the symbolic matrix 'X0' with the numpy array 'xx', which is a valid point but not directly related to the git diff. Lastly, the RESPONSE suggests using 'sympy.Matrix' to create a symbolic matrix and then convert it to a 'numpy' array if necessary, which is a viable alternative approach but not one that is reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the printing functions and the explicit addition of matrix power and inverse printing in 'pycode.py'. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in addressing all aspects of the issue.",
