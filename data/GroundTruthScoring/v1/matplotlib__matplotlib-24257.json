    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general guide on how to distribute style files in Python packages, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It includes steps for creating a style file, placing it within a package, and ensuring it is included in package data. The RESPONSE also provides an example of how to set up the `setup.py` file to include style files and how users can use the style from the package.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff, which includes specific changes to the `matplotlib` library to support the distribution of style files in Python packages. The git diff shows modifications to the `core.py` file to handle different Python versions and the import of style files, as well as updates to the `setup.py` file to include a conditional dependency on `importlib-resources` for Python versions below 3.10. Additionally, the git diff updates the documentation in `customizing.py` to explain how to distribute style files within Python packages.\n\nThe RESPONSE misses these specific details and does not mention the conditional dependency or the handling of different Python versions. It also does not provide information on updating the documentation to reflect these changes, which is a significant part of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete compared to the git diff.",
