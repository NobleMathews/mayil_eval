    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the core issue of the `OneHotEncoder` throwing an `AttributeError` instead of a `NotFittedError` when `transform` is called before `fit`. The suggested solution to add a check for the `categories_` attribute in the `transform` method and raise a `NotFittedError` if it is not set is in line with the git diff, which also adds a `check_is_fitted` call for the same purpose.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises to remove references to `_legacy_mode`, which aligns with the git diff that removes unnecessary whitespace and comments related to deprecation warnings.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the additional changes made in the git diff, such as handling the case where no categorical columns exist by setting `categories_` to an empty list. This omission is why the RESPONSE does not receive a perfect score. The RESPONSE is still highly valuable as it addresses the main issue and provides a clear solution that would prevent the incorrect error from being raised.",
