    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the input array's mask is writable and, if not, creating a copy of the masked array with a writable mask before passing it to `plt.pcolormesh`. This aligns with the git diff's approach of adding the `copy=True` parameter to the `cbook.safe_masked_invalid` function, which ensures that a copy of the array is made, thus avoiding the issue with read-only masks.\n\nThe RESPONSE also advises modifying the `pcolormesh` function to handle read-only masks by copying the input array if necessary. This is a valid alternative approach to the problem, as it ensures that the mask is writable before any modifications are attempted.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests ensuring that other functions that might modify the mask of a masked array also handle read-only masks appropriately. This is a broader and proactive solution that could prevent similar issues in other parts of the code.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly mention the `safe_masked_invalid` function, which is the focus of the git diff. Instead, it suggests changes to the `pcolormesh` function itself, which is not directly addressed in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a viable alternative solution, it does not perfectly align with the git diff's specific changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that would likely resolve the issue, but it does not match the git diff in terms of the exact location and nature of the changes. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
