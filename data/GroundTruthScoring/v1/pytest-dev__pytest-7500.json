    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests swapping the `for` statements within `cleanup_numbered_dir` to address the issue of `PermissionError` when cleaning up temporary directories. This suggestion is somewhat relevant to the issue described, as it addresses the timing of cleanup operations which could potentially prevent the error. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which instead modifies the `ensure_deletable` function to handle the case where the lock file cannot be accessed due to permissions issues. The RESPONSE's suggestion does not directly address the underlying problem of permission errors when accessing the lock file, which is the focus of the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a potential workaround, it does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The RESPONSE is given a score of 4 as it offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and only partially relevant to the git diff.",
