    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring a fixed `random_state`, checking for known bugs, setting `n_jobs=None` or `n_jobs=-1`, investigating race conditions, and as a last resort, running `KMeans` with `n_jobs=1`. However, the git diff indicates that the actual solution involves modifying the seeding process for the initial centroids by generating seeds before the conditional check for `n_jobs` and using these seeds directly in the `kmeans_single` function call. The RESPONSE does not address the seeding process or the changes in the code structure shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the `n_jobs` parameter and its impact on the results, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes code snippet references that are not directly related to the issue at hand, which do not provide additional value in this context.",
