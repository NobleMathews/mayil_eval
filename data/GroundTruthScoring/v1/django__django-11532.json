    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `make_msgid` function and the `forbid_multi_line_headers` function in `django/core/mail/message.py` to use a punycode-encoded `DNS_NAME`. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes involve creating a new `punycode` function in `django/utils/encoding.py` and using it in various places where domain names are handled, including `django/core/mail/message.py`, `django/core/mail/utils.py`, `django/core/validators.py`, and `django/utils/html.py`. The RESPONSE does not mention creating a new function or updating these additional files.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of encoding non-ASCII domain names and suggests using punycode. However, it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, such as the specific implementation of the `punycode` function and the updates to multiple files. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the `forbid_multi_line_headers` function, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does correctly suggest adding a test case to assert the `Message-ID` contains the punycode-encoded domain, which is in line with the git diff's intent to handle non-ASCII domain names correctly. However, the RESPONSE's guidance on how to implement the fix is not closely aligned with the git diff's approach.",
