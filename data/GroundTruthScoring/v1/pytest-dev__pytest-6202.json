    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that is partially aligned with the git diff. It correctly identifies the file `src/_pytest/python.py` and the need to modify the function containing the `replace(\".[\", \"[\")` operation. The RESPONSE suggests either replacing the `replace(\".[\", \"[\")` with `return s` or removing the `replace` call entirely, which is in line with the git diff's removal of the `replace` call. However, the RESPONSE does not provide the exact change as shown in the git diff, which is to simply return `\".\".join(parts)` without any replacement operation. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippets that do not contribute to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff but lacks the precision of the actual change needed. It provides a general direction for the fix but does not match the git diff's approach closely enough to score higher.",
