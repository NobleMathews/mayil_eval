    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of adding a registration label `ascii.latex` to Cosmology IO. It correctly identifies the file to be modified (`astropy/cosmology/io/latex.py`) and provides the exact code snippet that needs to be added to register the `write_latex` function for the `ascii.latex` format. This matches the git diff's approach to the issue, which also involves registering the `write_latex` function for the `ascii.latex` format. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises ensuring that the `write_latex` function can handle the `ascii.latex` format and suggests adding appropriate unit tests, which are good practices even though they are not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not directly mention the modification of the format check to include `ascii.latex`, which is present in the git diff, but this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate as the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff.",
