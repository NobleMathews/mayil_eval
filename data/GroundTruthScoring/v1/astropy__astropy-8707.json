    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating both `Header.fromstring` and `Card.fromstring` to handle byte strings by checking the type and decoding using the 'ascii' codec. This is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which also introduces checks for byte strings and decoding. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests using the 'ascii' codec for decoding, while the git diff uses 'latin1'. The 'latin1' codec is used in the git diff to ensure that any non-ASCII bytes are retained, which is important for handling malformatted FITS files. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the file opening mode in `Header.fromfile`, which is not mentioned in the git diff and is not directly related to the issue of `Header.fromstring` not accepting Python 3 bytes. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to add tests, which is a good practice but is not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide the correct decoding codec and includes unrelated suggestions, thus it only partially aligns with the git diff and does not offer a complete solution to the issue.",
