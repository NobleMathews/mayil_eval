    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of investigative steps that are somewhat aligned with the git diff but does not provide a specific solution. It correctly identifies the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` as the location to investigate, which is consistent with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not offer a concrete code change or directly address the alteration of the conditional statement as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests adding a conditional check to differentiate between xfail and skip, which is somewhat related to the change in the git diff, but it does not capture the specific change of replacing 'elif' with 'if' to correct the skip location reporting. The inclusion of a link to a code snippet is not directly relevant to the fix required. Overall, the RESPONSE provides a starting point for investigation but lacks the precise actionable guidance needed to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
