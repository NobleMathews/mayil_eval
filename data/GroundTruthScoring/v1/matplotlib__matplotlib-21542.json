    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to updating the colorbar tick formatting to use new-style format strings, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the existing formatting logic and ensuring that the `Colorbar` class uses the formatter from the associated `Axis` object, which aligns with the ISSUE's goal of updating the formatting convention.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes that match the git diff. The git diff includes a try-except block to check the format between `FormatStrFormatter` and `StrMethodFormatter`, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests removing the old-style formatting logic and using the formatter from the `Axis` object, which is a different approach.\n\nThe RESPONSE also mentions implementing a deprecation cycle and updating documentation, which are good practices but are not reflected in the git diff. The git diff focuses on handling the format string within the `__init__` method of the `Colorbar` class, without indicating a deprecation cycle.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that is relevant to the ISSUE but does not closely match the git diff's approach. It offers a different solution that could potentially resolve the ISSUE but lacks the specific implementation details provided in the git diff.",
