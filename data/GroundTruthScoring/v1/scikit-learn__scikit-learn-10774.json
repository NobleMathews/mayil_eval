    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to implement the `return_X_y` option for more dataset loaders/fetchers in scikit-learn, which is exactly what the git diff shows as the solution to the issue. It provides a clear, high-level overview of the necessary changes, including adding the `return_X_y` parameter and implementing the logic to return `(data, target)` when `return_X_y` is `True`. The RESPONSE also includes an example modification for the `fetch_kddcup99` function, which is one of the functions mentioned in the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE suggests updating the documentation strings to reflect the new parameter and its behavior, which is also in line with the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is perfectly aligned with the git diff and provides actionable and relevant instructions that would enable a developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
