    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but does not closely match the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring thread-safe lock file creation and deletion, using a random suffix for temporary directories, implementing a check to handle the case where the lock file might have been deleted by another process, and considering a more robust locking mechanism. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of handling concurrent access to lock files, they do not align with the git diff's approach. The git diff specifically adds a context manager from the 'contextlib' module to suppress any 'OSError' exceptions when attempting to unlink the lock file, which directly addresses the 'FileNotFoundError' issue. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach and instead suggests broader changes that are not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a reference to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
