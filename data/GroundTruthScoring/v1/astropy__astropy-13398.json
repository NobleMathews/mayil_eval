    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE outlines a high-level approach to implementing the feature request for direct ITRS to Observed transformations, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It correctly suggests defining transformation matrices and implementing transformation functions, as well as adding these to the frame_transform_graph. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to treat the ITRS position as time invariant and to adopt the obstime of the output frame from the input frame, which aligns with the git diff's approach to handling obstime and location.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff in terms of the specific changes made to the codebase. The git diff includes the addition of a new file, itrs_observed_transforms.py, which contains detailed implementations of the matrix transformations and refraction adjustments. The RESPONSE does not mention the creation of this new file or the specific functions and transformations that are included in the git diff, such as itrs_to_altaz_mat, itrs_to_hadec_mat, altaz_to_hadec_mat, add_refraction, remove_refraction, and the specific frame transformations for ITRS to AltAz and HADec.\n\nThe RESPONSE also does not address the spelling correction made in the git diff (changing 'siderial' to 'sidereal') or the changes to the comments that clarify the operations being performed. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention the updates to the ITRS class in itrs.py, which are significant changes included in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a general approach that is on the right track but lacks the detailed and specific changes that are present in the git diff. Therefore, it is scored as partially relevant but incomplete.",
