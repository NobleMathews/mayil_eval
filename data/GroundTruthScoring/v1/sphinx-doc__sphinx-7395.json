    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `add_target_and_index` method in the `PyFunction` class to ensure consistent formatting of index entries, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific changes made. The git diff shows that the `get_index_text` method is being overridden to return `None` and the index entries are being added directly in the `add_target_and_index` method, while the RESPONSE suggests checking if the function is a built-in and formatting the index entry accordingly, which is not present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is not aligned with the git diff, as it introduces a check for built-in functions using `name in dir(builtins)` and formats the text differently. The git diff does not include such a check and uses a different approach to format the index entries.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets and suggests reviewing and updating logic in other files, which is beyond the scope of the git diff and does not directly contribute to resolving the issue as described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
