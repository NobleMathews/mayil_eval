{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `coord` has a `name` attribute before calling `polyval` and raising a more informative error if it is missing, which is a valid suggestion and aligns with the git diff's addition of error handling for the `degree_dim` parameter. However, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff to the `polyval` function's signature and the addition of the `@overload` decorators, which are significant modifications to the function's behavior and type checking.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests inferring the `name` from `coord.dims` if there is only one dimension and setting it automatically. This is not present in the git diff, and while it could be a viable solution, it introduces a new behavior that is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff focuses on improving the type checking and error handling without changing the existing API contract that requires the `name` attribute to be set.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation to clearly state the requirement for the `name` attribute on the `coord` DataArray, which is a good practice but is not part of the git diff provided. The git diff does not include any changes to documentation.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that is partially relevant to the issue and partially matches the git diff. However, it does not fully align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue, and it introduces suggestions that are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.",
