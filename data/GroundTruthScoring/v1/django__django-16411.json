    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue described, which is to expose a manifest_hash that changes whenever anything in the manifest changes. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ManifestFilesMixin` class to include a method that exposes the `manifest_hash` and updating the `manifest_hash` whenever the manifest changes, which aligns with the git diff's approach of adding a `manifest_hash` to the payload and updating it in the `save_manifest` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a rough implementation and an example of how to modify a Django view to include the `X-Asset-Hash` header, which is relevant to the issue's request for a way to send along a header in responses.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not explicitly mention updating the `manifest_version` to \"1.1\" as shown in the git diff, nor does it include the changes to the `load_manifest` method that handle the new version and hash. While these omissions do not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, they prevent it from being a perfect match to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored an 8, as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff but is not a direct match in all aspects.",
