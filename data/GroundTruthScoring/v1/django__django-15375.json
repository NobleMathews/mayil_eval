{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the handling of the `default` parameter in the `Sum` aggregate function and suggests reviewing and modifying the `resolve_expression` method in `django/db/models/aggregates.py`. The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code snippet that closely resembles the git diff, including the use of the `Coalesce` function and setting the `is_summary` attribute, which are key elements in the git diff. However, the RESPONSE includes additional code and comments that are not present in the git diff, such as handling the `default` parameter when it is not an expression and resetting the `default` argument before wrapping, which are not necessary according to the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for further investigation, which are not directly related to the fix but could be useful for understanding the context. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns closely with the git diff, but it includes some unnecessary elements, which is why it does not receive a perfect score.",
