    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file and method (`_print_Sum` in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`) where the issue is located, which is consistent with the git diff. It correctly suggests that the solution involves adjusting the baseline to align the additional terms with the summation symbol. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed instructions on how to adjust the baseline, which makes it less actionable than the git diff. The git diff provides concrete code changes, including the exact lines to be modified and the new values to be used. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, offers a general approach without the specifics needed to implement the solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking if the expression contains additional terms outside of the `Sum` and adjusting the baseline accordingly, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff focuses on adjusting the baseline directly without such conditional checks. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and lacks the detail and precision of the provided solution.",
