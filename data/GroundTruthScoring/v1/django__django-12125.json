    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests manually updating the migration files to use the correct path for inner classes, which is a temporary workaround but does not address the root cause of the issue. The git diff provided shows a change in the serializer.py file, specifically altering the serialization of classes to use the __qualname__ attribute instead of __name__, which would automatically handle inner classes correctly in migrations. The RESPONSE fails to address the actual code change needed in the serializer and instead focuses on a manual fix for the migrations. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the 'create_many_to_many_intermediary_model' function, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it acknowledges the problem with inner class paths in migrations but does not provide a solution that aligns with the git diff or effectively prevents the issue from recurring in future migrations.",
