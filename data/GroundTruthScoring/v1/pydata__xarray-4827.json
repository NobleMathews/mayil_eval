    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the requested feature for a new `combine_attrs` option called `\"drop_conflicts\"`. It correctly identifies the need to update the `merge_attrs` function in `xarray/core/merge.py` and to add the new option to the documentation strings in `xarray/core/combine.py` and `xarray/core/concat.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests adding test cases, which is a crucial step in the development process to ensure the new behavior works as expected.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed changes to the `merge_attrs` function closely match the git diff's approach, with a minor difference in the implementation details. The RESPONSE suggests using a loop and an `if` statement to handle conflicts, while the git diff uses a more compact approach with dictionary comprehensions and set operations. However, both approaches are valid and aim to achieve the same result, which is to drop conflicting attributes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly advises updating the documentation strings to include the new `\"drop_conflicts\"` option and provides the correct description to be added, which aligns with the git diff.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE emphasizes the importance of adding unit tests, which is aligned with best practices but not explicitly shown in the git diff. This does not detract from the RESPONSE's value, as it is an essential part of the development process that would be expected by developers.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It offers a slightly different but valid implementation approach and covers all necessary aspects, including code changes and testing.",
