    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing the missing abstract methods `get_closest_marker`, `gethookproxy`, and `isinitpath` in the `YamlFile` class, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the methods `gethookproxy` and `isinitpath` should be deprecated in the `FSCollector` and `Package` classes and that their functionality should be moved to use `self.session.gethookproxy()` and `self.session.isinitpath()` instead. The RESPONSE does not mention deprecating these methods or updating their implementations to use the session methods. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly suggests implementing `get_closest_marker`, which is not mentioned in the git diff or the issue description. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
