    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `BaseModelFormSet` class to implement an 'edit only' view for model formsets in Django, which is relevant to the ISSUE that seeks a way to disallow new object creation in model formsets. However, the RESPONSE's approach differs significantly from the git diff provided. The git diff introduces an `edit_only` parameter in the `modelformset_factory` and `inlineformset_factory` functions and modifies the `save` method to conditionally prevent the saving of new objects. In contrast, the RESPONSE suggests overriding the `_construct_form` and `initial_form_count` methods, which is not reflected in the git diff. While the RESPONSE's approach could theoretically address the issue, it does not align closely with the git diff's solution and introduces complexity that may not be necessary. The RESPONSE also includes a step to modify the `total_form_count` method, which is not part of the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, hence the score of 2.",
