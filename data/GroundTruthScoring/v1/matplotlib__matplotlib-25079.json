    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not align with the git diff and offers general advice rather than a specific solution to the issue. The git diff shows that the problem was resolved by blocking callbacks during the update of `vmin` and `vmax` and then triggering a change event after the autoscale operation. The RESPONSE, however, suggests ensuring `vmin` and `vmax` are not `None`, ensuring they are strictly positive, setting them at the time of `LogNorm` creation, and considering downgrading matplotlib as a workaround. These suggestions do not address the core issue of the callbacks causing an invalid state, which was the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable steps that would lead to the same outcome as the git diff, and therefore, it is not effective in assisting a developer to fix the issue. The RESPONSE is given a score of 1 because it is somewhat relevant to the issue of `vmin` and `vmax` handling but fails to provide actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
