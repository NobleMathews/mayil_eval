    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the `napoleon_use_rtype` configuration, checking the docstring format, ensuring the `napoleon` extension is included, upgrading Sphinx, and reporting the issue if unresolved. While these are general troubleshooting steps for Sphinx documentation issues, they do not address the specific problem described in the ISSUE, which is related to the `autodoc_typehints_description_target` not working with the Napoleon plugin when using Google style docstrings.\n\nThe git diff provided shows that the actual fix involves modifying the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` file to handle 'returns' as an alias for 'return' in the documentation generation process. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying any code or files related to Sphinx internals, which is the core of the solution according to the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it pertains to Sphinx documentation but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff. It does not provide guidance that would lead to the resolution of the issue as per the git diff.",
