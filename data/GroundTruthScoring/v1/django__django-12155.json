    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'trim_docstring' function to fix the issue with docstring rendering. However, the git diff provided shows that the 'trim_docstring' function is completely removed and replaced with the 'cleandoc' function from the 'inspect' module. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of using 'cleandoc' and instead offers a solution that is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a link to code snippets that are not relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
