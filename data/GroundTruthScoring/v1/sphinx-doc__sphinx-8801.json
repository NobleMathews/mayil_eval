    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows changes to the `get_class_members` function in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` file, which involves handling the documentation of inherited class members. The RESPONSE, however, provides generic troubleshooting steps that are not related to the code changes in the git diff. It suggests checking imports, docstrings, inheritance, and Sphinx configuration, none of which are relevant to the actual code changes needed to fix the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE incorrectly references the `autosummary` extension and provides links to unrelated code snippets, which further indicates a misunderstanding of the issue. There is no actionable guidance provided that would help in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
