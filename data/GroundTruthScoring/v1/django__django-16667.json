    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding validation for year input in the `SelectDateWidget.value_from_datadict` method to handle large integers that cause `OverflowError`, which is a relevant approach to the issue described. It also correctly identifies the need to modify the method to check if the year is within a reasonable range before attempting to create a `datetime.date` object. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of simply catching the `OverflowError` and returning a default '0-0-0' date string. Instead, it proposes a more complex solution involving checking against `date.max.year` and `date.min.year`, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes handling for `ValueError`, which is not part of the issue described or the git diff. While the RESPONSE provides a valid alternative solution, it does not closely match the git diff's simpler and more direct approach to the problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not mention updating the `ReproForm` and `repro_view` to use the updated `SelectDateWidget`, which is not necessary according to the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers actionable advice but does not closely match the git diff's solution.",
