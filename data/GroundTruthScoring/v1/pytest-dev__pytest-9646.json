    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a refactoring of the warning system within the pytest codebase, specifically moving the warning check to a separate method and adding a condition to prevent the same warning from being issued multiple times. The RESPONSE, however, focuses on general troubleshooting steps for warning suppression in pytest, which is not directly related to the code changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE does mention checking plugins and their configurations, which is somewhat relevant to the issue since the warnings are related to plugin behavior. However, it does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as refactoring the warning system or the condition to prevent duplicate warnings. The RESPONSE also incorrectly references code snippets from a repository that are not related to the issue at hand, further reducing its relevance and utility. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored as a 1, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
