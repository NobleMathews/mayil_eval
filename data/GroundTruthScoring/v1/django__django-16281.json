    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general advice on how to handle migrations involving changes to a `ManyToManyField`, including creating and applying migrations, adjusting the `through_fields` attribute, and verifying the database schema. However, it does not address the specific changes required in the code to fix the issue as shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the `_remake_table` method and handling `alter_fields` as a list, which is not mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE also suggests inspecting code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the context of migrations and `ManyToManyField` adjustments, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it scores low on the scale.",
