    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE incorrectly states that the relevant code snippet is in `src/flask/sansio/blueprints.py` and that the `Blueprint` class constructor already has a check for an empty name. However, the git diff indicates that the necessary change is to be made in `src/flask/blueprints.py`, not `src/flask/sansio/blueprints.py`. Additionally, the git diff shows that the check for an empty name is being added, which contradicts the RESPONSE's claim that it already exists. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to provide correct guidance to address the issue of requiring a non-empty name for Blueprints. Therefore, it does not offer any actionable or meaningful guidance to assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
