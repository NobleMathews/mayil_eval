    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests uncommenting the `rewrite_github_anchor` function in `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` to enable rewriting of GitHub anchors. However, the git diff shows that the correct solution is to keep the `rewrite_github_anchor` function commented out, as it is causing the issue. The RESPONSE fails to align with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. Instead, it suggests an action that contradicts the git diff, which would not resolve the issue but rather perpetuate it. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the temporary nature of the fix mentioned in the git diff comment ('FIXME: Disable URL rewrite handler for github.com temporarily.').",
