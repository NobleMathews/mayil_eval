    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general approach to debugging the issue, such as reviewing the `_eval_power` method, ensuring base cases to prevent infinite recursion, and checking the `sqrt` and `tan` functions for potential causes of the recursion error. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a specific change in the `sympy/core/power.py` file, where the condition is changed from checking if `b.is_extended_real is False` to an `elif` clause with `b.is_negative is False`, and the return statement is changed to `return Pow(b, -other)`. The RESPONSE does not mention this specific change or the logic behind it, which is crucial for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
