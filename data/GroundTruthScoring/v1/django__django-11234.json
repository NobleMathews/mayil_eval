{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a list of general troubleshooting steps for issues related to GenericForeignKey and prefetching in Django, but it does not align with the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff shows a modification to the `related.py` file, specifically adding a `get_prep_value` method to a field class, which is not mentioned or addressed in the RESPONSE.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests verifying field types, checking the correct usage of `content_type`, and potentially overriding methods to handle prefetching, which are all reasonable suggestions in the context of the issue. However, these suggestions do not directly address the problem described in the issue or the solution provided in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not provide actionable guidance on what to do with those snippets or how they relate to the specific problem at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the broader context of the issue but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
