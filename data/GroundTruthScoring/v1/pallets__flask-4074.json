{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that it is not possible to mount the same blueprint twice with different prefixes and have `url_for` generate different URLs based on the blueprint instance, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows that Flask has been modified to support registering the same blueprint multiple times with unique names for `url_for`, which directly contradicts the RESPONSE's claim that it is not possible.\n\nThe RESPONSE does offer a workaround by creating separate blueprint instances with different names, which is a valid approach but not as elegant or efficient as the changes shown in the git diff. The workaround does not take advantage of the new Flask features introduced in the git diff, such as the ability to register the same blueprint multiple times with unique names.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to recognize the new capabilities added to Flask as per the git diff and offers a workaround that, while functional, is not as effective as the solution provided by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
