    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of needing a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option in pytest. It correctly identifies the typical location for CLI argument definitions and provides a general approach to adding a new shortcut argument. The RESPONSE also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the new shortcut does not conflict with existing ones, which is a crucial consideration. The example code snippet given in the RESPONSE is not an exact match to the git diff, which uses '--co' as the shortcut, but it does suggest a similar approach with a placeholder character '-c'. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff's choice of shortcut, but it does offer a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to provide a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
