    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `commit` and `rollback` functions in the `django/db/transaction.py` file to include logging statements. However, the git diff indicates that the changes should be made in the `django/db/backends/base/base.py` and `django/db/backends/oracle/base.py` files, as well as adding a new context manager `debug_transaction` in `django/db/backends/utils.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of using a context manager to wrap the commit and rollback operations for logging. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests logging at the info level, while the git diff does not specify a logging level but rather adds detailed timing information and uses the debug level. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of logging commits and rollbacks but fails to provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
