    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `IntegerField` class to include the model in the comparison logic for `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods, which is aligned with the intent of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly assumes that the changes should be made specifically to the `IntegerField` class, whereas the git diff shows that the changes are made to the `Field` class, which is the base class for all field types in Django models, not just `IntegerField`. This is a significant deviation from the git diff, as the issue affects all field types, not just `IntegerField`. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide the correct implementation details as shown in the git diff, such as the specific conditions and ordering logic in the `__lt__` method and the complex hash tuple in the `__hash__` method. The RESPONSE also introduces a `contribute_to_class` method and a `deconstruct` method update, which are not part of the git diff and are not necessary for resolving the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
