    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to modify the `make_blobs` function to accept `n_samples` as a tuple, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It includes a code snippet that demonstrates the changes to the function signature and the handling of `n_samples` when it is a tuple. The RESPONSE also suggests updating the documentation and adding tests, which is good practice but not directly reflected in the GIT DIFF.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align with the GIT DIFF in several ways. The GIT DIFF shows that `make_blobs` has been updated to accept `n_samples` as an `int` or array-like, not specifically a tuple. The GIT DIFF also includes changes to the handling of `centers` and `cluster_std` parameters, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests using a generator for uniform distribution and handling the tuple directly in the `make_blobs` function, while the GIT DIFF uses the `make_blobs` function from `sklearn.datasets` with predefined parameters and does not show any changes related to a generator.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not closely match the GIT DIFF and is incomplete in addressing the changes shown there. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.",
