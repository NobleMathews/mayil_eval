    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_print_Order` function in various files, including `sympy/printing/latex.py`, to use the correct typesetting for the big-O symbol. The RESPONSE correctly identifies that the issue is related to typesetting the big-O symbol and provides an alternative approach to the git diff by suggesting changes in multiple files and using Unicode characters for different representations (plain text, LaTeX, MathML).\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically changes the LaTeX representation from \"\\mathcal{O}\" to \"O\" in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, while the RESPONSE suggests using \"\\mathcal{O}\" which is the opposite of what the git diff shows. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes changes to files and representations (like Unicode and MathML) that are not mentioned in the git diff, which makes it partially relevant but not actionable in the context of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue as described in the git diff, and it introduces suggestions that are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score for somewhat addressing the issue but not providing actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff.",
