    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `keep_attrs` parameter is passed correctly through the `rolling` method to the `mean` method and modifying the `mean` method within the `DataArrayRolling` class to respect the `keep_attrs` parameter. However, the git diff provided shows a more comprehensive update to the rolling functionality in xarray, including deprecation warnings for the `keep_attrs` parameter, changes to the default behavior, and updates to various methods to handle attributes correctly. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of handling the `keep_attrs` parameter and the associated deprecation warning. It also does not provide a complete solution to the issue described, as it only focuses on the `mean` method and does not address the broader changes made in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue.",
