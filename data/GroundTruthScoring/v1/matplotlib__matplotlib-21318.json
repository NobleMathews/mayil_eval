    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests two alternative solutions to the issue: removing the 'ax.axis(\"equal\")' line or not sharing both axes. While these suggestions could potentially avoid the RuntimeError, they do not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff modifies the error message to provide more informative guidance to the user and comments out a line of code that seems to be related to the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code changes made in the git diff, such as improving the error message or the implications of commenting out the 'self.apply_aspect()' line. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the incompatibility issue but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a solution that would allow the user to keep both 'axis(\"equal\")' and shared axes, which the git diff implies is possible with a different 'adjustable' setting. The RESPONSE is scored a 2 because it offers a workaround rather than a direct solution to the issue described.",
