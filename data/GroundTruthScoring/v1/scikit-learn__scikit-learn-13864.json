    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results to score higher.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance or a solution to the issue described. It suggests reviewing a commit and identifying if a regression was introduced, which is not helpful in resolving the current issue. The RESPONSE also suggests adding a check for `Y is not None` before the dtype comparison, but this is not aligned with the git diff provided, which has already implemented a solution by modifying the condition to `(X.dtype != bool or (Y is not None and Y.dtype != bool))`. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific changes made in the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution. Therefore, it does not assist the developer in fixing the issue and scores a 0.",
