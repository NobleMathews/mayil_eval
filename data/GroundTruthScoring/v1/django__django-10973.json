{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and code example on how to modify the `DatabaseClient` class to use `subprocess.run` and set the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable, which aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `runshell` method and mentions the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method, which is not directly referenced in the git diff but is a plausible part of the solution. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle the `PGPASSWORD` only when a password is provided, which is consistent with the git diff's removal of the temporary `.pgpass` file handling. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it introduces a `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method that is not present in the diff, but the overall approach is effective and relevant. The RESPONSE also includes links to the relevant code snippets, which is helpful but not necessary for the solution. The RESPONSE is scored a 9 because it provides a highly relevant and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff, despite minor differences in implementation details.",
