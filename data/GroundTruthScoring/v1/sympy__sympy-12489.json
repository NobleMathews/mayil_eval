    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of the issue with subclassing the `Permutation` class and offers a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to use `cls` instead of the `Permutation` or `Perm` when creating new instances, which is the main point of the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly suggests changing `_af_new` to a `@classmethod` and using `cls` to ensure that instances of subclasses are returned. The RESPONSE provides actionable guidance and a code snippet that would help the developer to fix the issue. The RESPONSE does not directly match the git diff in terms of the exact changes made, but it offers a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE aligns with the git diff by suggesting the use of `cls` in place of `Permutation` or `Perm` and converting `_af_new` to a `@classmethod`. This matches the git diff's approach of using `cls` to ensure that the correct class instances are created, which is key to resolving the subclassing issue. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to pass the subclass type when calling `Basic.__new__`, which is reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE's solution is effective and relevant, providing a clear and actionable alternative to the git diff that would resolve the issue described.",
