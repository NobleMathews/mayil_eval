    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general solution to the issue of reverse accessor clashes by suggesting the manual addition of unique related_name arguments to the ForeignKey fields. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows an automated approach to generating related_name attributes when inspectdb is used to generate models from an existing database. The git diff includes changes to the inspectdb.py file that automatically add a related_name argument when the same related model is used more than once in a table. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests manual changes to the model code and does not address the automation aspect of the issue. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the same error (fields.E304), it lacks actionable content in the context of the git diff, which is focused on modifying the Django management command to handle this issue automatically.",
