    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests downgrading matplotlib, checking for updates or patches for mplcursor, and reporting the issue to the mplcursor maintainers. It also provides links to various code snippets related to cursor interaction in matplotlib. However, none of these suggestions align with the git diff provided, which shows changes to the `offsetbox.py` file to fix the issue with event handling and disconnection of callbacks. The RESPONSE does not address the specific AttributeError mentioned in the issue or provide any actionable guidance that would help in resolving the AttributeError. Instead, it offers general troubleshooting steps and references to unrelated code snippets. The RESPONSE fails to provide any meaningful assistance in fixing the issue as per the git diff, and therefore, it receives a score of 0.",
