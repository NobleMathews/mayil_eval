    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and relevant solution to the issue of adding system checks for invalid model field names for functional indexes in `Meta.indexes`. It suggests extending the existing system checks to include validation for functional indexes and implementing a method to validate expressions used in functional indexes. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to catch `FieldError` exceptions when resolving expressions, which is in line with the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE's proposed solution is to add a new method `_check_functional_indexes` that iterates over all indexes and checks if they contain expressions, then validates each expression. This approach is conceptually similar to the git diff, which also adds a new check for indexes that contain expressions and updates a set of references based on the expressions found.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff's implementation, which involves updating a `references` set and then adding it to the list of fields to be checked. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests directly adding error messages when invalid fields are detected. While this is a viable alternative approach, it does not capture the specific implementation details of the git diff, such as the use of the `references` set and the subsequent addition of this set to the fields list for further checks.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that aligns with the git diff's intent to add checks for functional indexes, but it does not match the git diff's specific implementation. Therefore, it receives a score of 7.",
