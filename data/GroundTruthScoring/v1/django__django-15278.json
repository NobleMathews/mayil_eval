    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the `UNIQUE` constraint from the `source_refresh_token_id` field in the migration operation, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue is not with the migration file itself but with the `add_field` method in the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` file, which needs to be modified to handle the addition of fields with unique constraints properly. The RESPONSE does not address the need to modify the `add_field` method and instead suggests a change to the migration file that would not solve the issue described. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information about the nature of the issue (SQLite not supporting unique constraints on nullable columns), but it fails to offer a solution that aligns with the git diff or is a viable alternative. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the solution and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue.",
