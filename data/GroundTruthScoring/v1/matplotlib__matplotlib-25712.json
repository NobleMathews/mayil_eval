    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue is with the axes limits being incorrectly set when using axes transform with `fill_between` and `fill_betweenx`, which aligns with the ISSUE description. However, the RESPONSE's proposed solution does not align with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the function signatures of `fill_between` and `fill_betweenx` to include a `transform` parameter and to handle it correctly when calculating the axes limits. While this could be a valid approach, it is not the one taken in the git diff. The git diff instead modifies the `update_datalim` call within the existing `fill_between` and `fill_betweenx` methods to conditionally update the axes limits based on whether the transform contains a branch separately. The RESPONSE does not address this specific solution and instead proposes a broader change to the function signatures and documentation. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the need to handle the `transform` parameter correctly, but it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
