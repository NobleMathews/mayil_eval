{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, providing clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed plan for updating the `QuantileTransformer` documentation, which aligns well with the issue requesting more details about its implementation. It suggests including information about the empirical CDF computation, the mapping to a uniform distribution, and the handling of out-of-bounds values, which are all mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the transformation as non-linear and the potential for distortion of linear correlations, which is consistent with the git diff changes.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `_transform_col` method and the checks for the `output_distribution`. It also does not mention the changes in the error handling and the specific code changes for handling the normal and uniform distributions. While the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides a clear guide for updating the documentation, it does not fully capture the technical details of the git diff, such as the refactoring of the `output_distribution` handling and the specific conditions for bounds checking.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 as it is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it does not capture all the technical details of the git diff changes.",
