    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to adding more SciPy functions to the `SciPyPrinter`, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests updating the `_known_functions_scipy_special` dictionary and creating new `_print_<function_name>` methods for special cases, which is a valid approach to the problem. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's specific implementation of adding `_print_airyai`, `_print_airyaiprime`, `_print_airybi`, and `_print_airybiprime` methods. Instead, it provides a more generic explanation and example that does not directly address the functions mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat helpful as it provides a correct methodology for extending the `SciPyPrinter` but lacks the specific actionable steps present in the git diff. Therefore, it partially matches the git diff and is awarded a score of 4.",
