    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the Django settings to ensure that the `my_tags` library is not duplicated and to remove or rename any duplicates. While this advice is somewhat relevant to the issue of duplicate template tag libraries, it does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. The git diff shows changes in the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function, where it modifies the data structure used to store module paths from a list to a set to prevent duplicates and sorts the items before reporting errors. The RESPONSE does not address the code changes needed in the Django checks module and instead focuses on manual configuration checks, which is only partially relevant. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
