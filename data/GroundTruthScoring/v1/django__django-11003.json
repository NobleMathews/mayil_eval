    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a multi-faceted approach to the issue, including setting the 'to_field_name' in the 'ModelChoiceField', modifying the 'validate' method to skip validation for disabled fields, customizing the error message, and handling the 'prepare_value' method for disabled fields. These suggestions are actionable and relevant to the issue described.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically adds a check to see if the value is an instance of the model and, if so, retrieves the appropriate attribute before attempting to get the object from the queryset. This is a direct and specific fix to the issue, which the RESPONSE does not mention.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the 'validate' method and the error message customization are not reflected in the git diff, and while they could be helpful for improving the form's behavior and error reporting, they do not address the core issue that the git diff resolves. The RESPONSE also suggests handling the 'prepare_value' method, which is not part of the git diff or the issue description.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some useful advice that could improve the form's behavior but does not closely match the git diff's approach to resolving the specific issue. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it is partially relevant but incomplete in addressing the issue as per the git diff.",
