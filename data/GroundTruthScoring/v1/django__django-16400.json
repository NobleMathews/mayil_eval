    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to troubleshooting the issue with the `migrate` management command not respecting the database parameter, but it does not offer a specific solution or directly address the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the `migrate` command and `TenantDatabaseRouter` respect the database parameter and that the `TenantSubdomainMiddleware` is correctly setting the `local_state.subdomain`. However, it does not provide actionable changes to the code, which is what the git diff does by modifying the `create_permissions` function to respect the `using` parameter when creating permissions.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the `create_permissions` function to ensure that the permissions are created using the correct database alias. Instead, it provides a high-level checklist that, while somewhat relevant, lacks the actionable content needed to resolve the issue as demonstrated in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the need to set the `_state.db` attribute on the `Permission` object, which is a key aspect of the git diff's solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide the necessary guidance to fix the issue as per the git diff. It offers a broader troubleshooting approach rather than a targeted fix.",
