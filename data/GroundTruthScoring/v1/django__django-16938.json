    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing `select_related(\"master\")` from the `TestTagManager.get_queryset` method or using `prefetch_related(\"master\")` instead. It also advises ensuring that the `master` field is not deferred in any queryset passed to `serializers.serialize`. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of serialization of many-to-many relations, they do not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes to the `queryset_iterator` function in two different files, where `select_related()` is added before `only(\"pk\").iterator()` without removing any existing `select_related` calls. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the iterator to include `select_related()` calls. Instead, it suggests alternative approaches that do not reflect the specific changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does provide some relevant information regarding the handling of `select_related` and deferred fields, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0. However, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns closely with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
