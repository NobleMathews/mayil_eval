{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and detailed plan for deprecating the use of `get_random_string` without an explicit length, which aligns with the ISSUE's request to force callers to specify the length value. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `get_random_string` function definition to remove the default value for `length`, which is consistent with the git diff's approach of handling the `length` parameter. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating all calls to `get_random_string` throughout the Django codebase to include an explicit length argument, which is also reflected in the git diff where calls to `get_random_string` are updated with a specific length. The RESPONSE further recommends updating documentation and adding a deprecation warning, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of a deprecation warning for not providing a length argument. However, the RESPONSE does not include the exact implementation of the deprecation warning as shown in the git diff, which uses `RemovedInDjango40Warning` and a specific `NOT_PROVIDED` object to handle the transition. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance, it does not match every aspect of the git diff's approach, warranting a score of 7.",
