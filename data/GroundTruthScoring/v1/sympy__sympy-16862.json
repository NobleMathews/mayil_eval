    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if the `ImageSet` is empty before accessing `args[0]` to prevent `IndexError`, modifying the test case for `(1, 0)`, and ensuring that `linsolve` returns an `EmptySet` when no solutions exist. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue of handling empty sets and preventing errors, they do not align with the git diff's approach to the problem.\n\nThe git diff shows that the actual fix involves wrapping the existing code in a try-except block to catch `NotImplementedError` and then using `solve` instead of `solveset` when a coupled system is detected. The RESPONSE does not mention this approach or the use of `solve` and does not address the changes made to the `Range` class in the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes suggestions for modifying test cases and the `linsolve` function, which are not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, but these do not offer actionable guidance in the context of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling empty sets but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
