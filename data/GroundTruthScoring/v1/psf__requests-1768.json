{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue as being related to the incorrect handling of spaces in passwords when extracting credentials from a URL for HTTP Basic Auth. It also correctly points out that the `get_auth_from_url` function in `requests/utils.py` needs to be modified, which is in line with the git diff provided.\n\nThe RESPONSE suggests using `unquote` to decode the username and password, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to ensure that `unquote` is imported if it's not already there, which is reflected in the git diff by the addition of `unquote` to the import statement.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional suggestions to check other parts of the code that are not mentioned in the git diff, such as the `_basic_auth_str` function and the `rebuild_auth` method. While these suggestions are not incorrect, they are not directly related to the specific change in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not directly align with every aspect of the git diff, which is why it does not receive a perfect score of 10.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, making it highly valuable for a developer looking to fix the issue.",
