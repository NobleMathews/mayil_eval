    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `set_xlim` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` by moving the callback processing outside of the conditional check for `emit`. However, the git diff provided shows that the changes were made in `lib/matplotlib/axis.py` within the `_set_lim` method, not the `set_xlim` method in `_base.py`. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not address the specific issue described in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets, which are not part of the git diff and do not provide actionable guidance for resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff.",
