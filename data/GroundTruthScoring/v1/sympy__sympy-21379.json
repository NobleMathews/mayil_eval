    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a solution to the issue described. The git diff shows that the solution involves handling a `PolynomialError` exception within the `eval` method of the `Mod` class in the `sympy` library. The RESPONSE, however, suggests various generic debugging steps that are not related to the actual fix. It does not mention handling exceptions or modifying the `eval` method. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing code in `manualintegrate.py` and `piecewise.py`, which are not part of the solution according to the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer an alternative solution to the issue.",
