    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of how to add the autocomplete attributes to Django's `contrib.auth` built-in forms, which is the core of the issue. It correctly identifies the fields that need to be updated and provides accurate code snippets for adding the `autocomplete` attribute to the username, email, current password, and new password fields. The RESPONSE also includes a custom implementation for the `UsernameField` widget attributes, which is not present in the git diff but is a valid alternative approach to achieve the same result. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests modifying the `UsernameField` class, which is not part of the git diff. However, the RESPONSE's alternative approach is valid and would effectively resolve the issue. The RESPONSE also correctly advises testing the forms in different browsers and updating the documentation, which are good practices but not part of the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, achieving similar results with a slightly different approach.",
