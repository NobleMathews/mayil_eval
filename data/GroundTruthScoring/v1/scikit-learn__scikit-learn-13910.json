{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the potential source of the issue as being related to the `euclidean_distances` function and numerical precision issues with `float32` data, which is consistent with the git diff that modifies the `_euclidean_distances_upcast` function to handle batch size calculations differently. The RESPONSE suggests verifying the upcasting process and checking the batch size calculation, which aligns with the git diff's introduction of a conditional batch size calculation. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the conditional handling of batch size and the restructuring of the memory calculation logic. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to consider using `float64` data type for the entire computation, which is not addressed in the git diff and may not be a viable solution due to potential memory and performance constraints. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, but these links are not actionable as they point to a non-existent repository and do not directly relate to the actual code changes in the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE provides some relevant advice but lacks the specificity and full alignment with the git diff that would warrant a higher score.",
