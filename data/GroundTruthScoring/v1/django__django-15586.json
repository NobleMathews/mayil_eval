{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the issue, offering clear, actionable, and highly relevant instructions and solutions that would enable the developer to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to enable the cached template loader by default in development for a Django project, which aligns with the issue's requirement. It offers a detailed explanation of how to modify the `TEMPLATES` configuration in the `settings.py` file, including the necessary changes to the 'loaders' key within the 'OPTIONS' dictionary. This matches the intent of the git diff, which is to ensure that the cached loader is used by default.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the change made in the git diff, which is a modification in the `django/template/engine.py` file. Instead, it suggests changes to the project's `settings.py` file, which is a different approach but achieves the same goal of enabling the cached loader by default. The RESPONSE also provides additional resources and code snippets for further research, which is helpful but not directly related to the git diff's changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE could have scored higher if it had directly addressed the change in the `django/template/engine.py` file as shown in the git diff. Nonetheless, it provides a viable alternative approach to the issue, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
