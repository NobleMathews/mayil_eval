    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing support for the new `clip` ufunc in Astropy's Quantity class, which is relevant to the issue. It suggests updating the `helper_clip` function and registering it in the `UFUNC_HELPERS` dictionary, which aligns with the changes made in the git diff to `astropy/units/quantity_helper/helpers.py`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the need to handle different NumPy versions, which is a significant part of the git diff. The git diff includes conditional logic to define the `clip` method only if `NUMPY_LT_1_17` is true, indicating that the method should only be present for NumPy versions less than 1.17. The RESPONSE fails to address this conditional logic and the associated import of `NUMPY_LT_1_17` from `astropy.utils.compat`.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to `astropy/units/quantity.py` and `astropy/units/quantity_helper/converters.py` in the git diff, which are crucial for the proper functioning of the `clip` method with Quantity objects.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is not fully aligned with the git diff, as it does not include the conditional logic for NumPy version handling and does not reflect the changes to the `__array_ufunc__` method and the `converters_and_unit` function.\n\nLastly, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets and a detailed explanation of the steps to implement the feature, which are not directly related to the git diff and do not provide actionable guidance for the specific changes required to resolve the issue.",
