    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `csrf_failure` function to include the charset in the `Content-Type` header, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the `content_type` parameter is being removed entirely from the `HttpResponseForbidden` call, rather than modifying it to include the charset. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, it does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
