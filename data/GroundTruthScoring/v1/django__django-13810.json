    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several actions regarding the `DummyMiddleware` and its compatibility with ASGI, such as marking it as async-capable, implementing an `__acall__` method, and using decorators for compatibility. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff, which addresses the issue by modifying the `load_middleware` method to correctly handle the `handler` variable when a `MiddlewareNotUsed` exception is raised. The RESPONSE fails to recognize the core problem of the `handler` variable being incorrectly overwritten and does not suggest modifying the `load_middleware` method as the git diff does. While the RESPONSE does provide some general advice on middleware compatibility with ASGI, it does not offer actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to resolving the specific issue of undesired side effects when loading middleware in an ASGI context. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff.",
