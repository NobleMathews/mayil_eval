    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_create_nan_agg_method` function to handle `min_count` properly for lazy arrays and updating the `nansum` function in `xarray/core/nanops.py`. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `_create_nan_agg_method` function or the `nansum` function. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the `maybe_promote` function and the use of the `where` function in `_maybe_null_out` to handle the `min_count` logic. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE does mention the correct file `xarray/core/nanops.py` but fails to provide actionable guidance that matches the git diff's changes. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `_create_nan_agg_method` function and the `nansum` function is not supported by the git diff, and there is no evidence that these changes would resolve the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue based on the git diff provided.",
