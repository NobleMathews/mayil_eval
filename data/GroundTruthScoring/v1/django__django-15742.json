    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and relevant solution to the issue of double escaping in the Django template tags. It suggests modifying the `render_token_list` method and the `render` method in the `BlockTranslateNode` class to handle the `SafeString` marking appropriately when the `asvar` option is used. This aligns with the git diff, which also modifies the `BlockTranslateNode` class to ensure that the result is stored as a `SafeString` instance to prevent future escaping. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it suggests checking if the variable is already marked as safe before escaping, which is not present in the git diff. However, this additional suggestion does not conflict with the git diff and could be considered a good practice to prevent unnecessary escaping. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets and links to the relevant sections of the code, which could be very helpful for the developer to locate the parts of the code that need to be modified. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, although it does not match it exactly.",
