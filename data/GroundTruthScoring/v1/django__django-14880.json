{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable set of instructions that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to update error messages in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to include the clashing name, which is the main issue described. The RESPONSE also suggests modifying the `checks.Error` calls within the `_check_clashes` method to interpolate the `clash_name` variable, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the unit tests to assert the presence of the clashing name in the error message, which is a necessary step given that the original issue mentions that the proposed patch impacts some unit tests. The RESPONSE does not provide the exact code changes as the git diff, but it offers a viable alternative approach that achieves the same result, which is to improve the error messages for reverse accessor clashes. The RESPONSE is not scored a 10 because it does not provide the exact code changes, but it is highly relevant and actionable, thus deserving a score of 9.",
