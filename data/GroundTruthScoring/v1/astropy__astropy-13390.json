    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `_compare` method to handle comparisons between `MaskedColumn` objects correctly, which is aligned with the git diff that modifies the `_compare` method. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to implement these changes, such as deferring to `NotImplemented` for certain cases or handling unicode and byte string comparisons, which are key elements of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests using `numpy.ma` functions for comparisons and checking for the correct `numpy` version, which are not mentioned in the git diff and do not directly address the issue described. The RESPONSE's mention of using `np.all()` instead of `np.all` is not relevant to the git diff or the issue, as the git diff does not modify any test functions or their use of `np.all`.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to ensure that the `dtype` of the columns being compared is compatible with the comparison operation is somewhat relevant but not actionable without specific instructions, and it does not closely match the git diff's approach.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some general advice that is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
