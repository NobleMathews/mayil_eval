    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable or relevant guidance that aligns with the git diff. It does not address the specific issue of adding support for the `where` keyword argument in `np.mean` for `astropy.units.Quantity` instances. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests verifying and checking the `mean` method, which is already correctly implemented in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets and does not offer any meaningful solution to the issue. The git diff shows that the actual solution involves conditional method definitions based on the NumPy version and adding the `where` keyword to several methods, which the RESPONSE fails to mention or address.",
