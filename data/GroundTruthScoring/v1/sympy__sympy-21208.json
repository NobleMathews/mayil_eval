    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides an explanation of the observed behavior when differentiating matrices and their elements in SymPy, which is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE. However, it does not offer a solution or actionable advice to fix the inconsistency in the results of differentiation. The git diff suggests changes in the `matexpr.py` file, specifically removing the `.doit()` calls to potentially address the issue. The RESPONSE does not align with this approach and instead offers a general explanation and a workaround using `applyfunc`, which does not directly address the underlying problem in the codebase. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
