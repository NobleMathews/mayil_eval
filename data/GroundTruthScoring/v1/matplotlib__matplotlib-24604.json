    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a new method called `gridspec_mosaic` in the `Figure` class that returns a dictionary of `SubplotSpec` instances. However, this does not align with the git diff provided, which instead modifies the existing `subplot_mosaic` method to accept a new parameter `per_subplot_kw`. This parameter allows users to specify different projections and other subplot properties on a per-Axes basis within the mosaic layout.\n\nThe RESPONSE fails to mention or incorporate the `per_subplot_kw` parameter or the related changes to the `subplot_mosaic` method. Instead, it proposes a separate method that is not present in the git diff and does not address the issue of combining different projections within the existing `subplot_mosaic` functionality.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described. It does not help the developer to fix the issue in the way that the git diff suggests, and it does not provide a valid alternative approach within the constraints of the software system.",
