{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately identifies the issue as being caused by the incorrect call to `inner_query.get_compiler` without the necessary `using` or `connection` argument. It provides a clear and actionable solution by suggesting to update the call to include the `using` or `connection` argument. The RESPONSE also correctly points out the need to ensure that `self.using` and `self.connection` are properly defined within the scope of the `get_qualify_sql` method. The RESPONSE's suggested code change closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue, which adds the `connection=self.connection` argument to the `inner_query.get_compiler` call. The RESPONSE also provides additional context by pointing to relevant code snippets that should be checked, which is helpful for a developer looking to understand the broader context of the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it includes `using=self.using` in the suggested code, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the main issue is the missing `connection` argument.",
