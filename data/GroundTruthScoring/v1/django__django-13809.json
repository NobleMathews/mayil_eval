{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate guide on how to implement the `--skip-checks` option for the `runserver` command in Django, which is the exact issue described. The steps outlined in the RESPONSE closely match the git diff provided, including the addition of the `--skip-checks` argument in the `add_arguments` method and the conditional check in the `inner_run` method to skip system checks if the option is set. The RESPONSE also correctly advises on updating the output message when the checks are skipped, which aligns with the git diff. The only reason it does not score a perfect 10 is that it includes an additional suggestion to ensure that the `--skip-checks` option is handled in the `migrate.py` file, which is not part of the git diff or the original issue. However, this does not detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE, as it provides a complete and actionable solution to the issue at hand.",
