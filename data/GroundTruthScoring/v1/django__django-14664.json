    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests removing the '__reduce_ex__' method from the 'ResolverMatch' class to allow 'ResolverMatch' objects to be pickled, which is the opposite of what the git diff does. The git diff adds a '__reduce_ex__' method that explicitly raises a 'PicklingError' to prevent pickling of 'ResolverMatch' objects, indicating that making 'ResolverMatch' pickleable is not the desired solution.\n\nFurthermore, the RESPONSE suggests implementing a custom '__reduce__' method and ensuring all objects within 'ResolverMatch' are pickleable. This is not aligned with the git diff, which does not implement a '__reduce__' method or make any changes to ensure pickleability of referenced objects.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for review, but this does not contribute to resolving the issue as per the git diff. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative solution to the issue described.",
