    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of enabling the `linkcheck` builder to check URLs of raw directives. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `HyperlinkCollector` class to collect URLs from `raw` directives and ensures that these URLs are processed by the `HyperlinkAvailabilityChecker`. The RESPONSE's suggested code changes are in line with the git diff's approach, which also involves adding a loop to process `raw` nodes and using the `add_uri` function to add the URLs to the list of URIs to be checked. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff, as it specifies checking for a 'url' attribute within `raw` nodes, whereas the git diff checks for a 'source' attribute. However, this difference does not significantly detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as the core idea of adding URL checking for `raw` nodes is present and correctly implemented. The RESPONSE also provides a helpful code snippet and references to the relevant sections of the codebase, which would assist the developer in locating where to make the necessary changes. The RESPONSE does not mention the `add_uri` function, which is a minor omission but does not significantly impact the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
