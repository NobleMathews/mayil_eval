    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to be considered valuable.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance or relevant information that aligns with the git diff. Instead, it suggests updating the documentation and provides a general outline of steps without addressing the specific changes made in the git diff. The git diff includes code modifications to handle the dropping behavior after grouping infrequent categories and to correct the method name from `_compute_drop_idx` to `_set_drop_idx`. It also adds clarifications in the comments and modifies several methods to use the updated drop index logic. The RESPONSE fails to mention any of these code changes or provide an alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, it does not assist the developer in fixing the issue and does not offer any value in the context of the git diff.",
