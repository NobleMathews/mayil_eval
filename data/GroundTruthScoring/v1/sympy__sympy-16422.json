    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with the LaTeX representation of `BaseScalar` objects and suggests updating the `_latex` method of the `BaseScalar` class to fix the LaTeX string. This is a relevant and actionable suggestion that addresses the issue described. However, the git diff provided shows changes in the `__new__` method of the `CoordSys3D` class, specifically in the way `pretty_vects` and `pretty_scalars` are constructed, not in the `_latex` method of the `BaseScalar` class. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the list comprehensions for `pretty_vects` and `pretty_scalars`. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is on the right track by addressing the LaTeX representation issue, it does not align with the specific changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but incomplete in terms of the actual code changes needed, which justifies a score of 4.",
