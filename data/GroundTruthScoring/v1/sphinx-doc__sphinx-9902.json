    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests several general troubleshooting steps for resolving issues with Sphinx documentation linking, such as ensuring proper imports, using full import paths, checking the `__all__` list, and configuring `autodoc_type_aliases`. However, these suggestions do not align with the specific changes made in the git diff, which modifies the `type_to_xref` function to handle relative and shorthand type references within the same module. The RESPONSE fails to address the core issue of the `type_to_xref` function not correctly handling relative type references, which is what the git diff aims to fix. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the changes seen in the git diff, such as handling the '.' and '~' prefixes in type references. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only marginally relevant as it addresses the broader context of Sphinx documentation but does not offer a solution to the specific issue described. The score of 1 reflects the RESPONSE's lack of alignment with the git diff and its failure to provide a viable alternative solution.",
