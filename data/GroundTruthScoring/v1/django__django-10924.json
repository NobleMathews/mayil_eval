{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a high-level overview of the steps needed to allow `FilePathField` to accept a callable for the `path` argument, which is the core issue. The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `__init__`, `deconstruct`, and `formfield` methods of the `FilePathField` class, which is relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that shows how to handle the callable in the `formfield` method, which aligns with the git diff provided. However, the RESPONSE does not mention changes to the `__init__` method in the git diff, and it introduces the idea of modifying the `deconstruct` method, which is not present in the git diff. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to update the `deconstruct` method is a valid consideration for handling callables in Django fields, it is not part of the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not perfectly align with the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
