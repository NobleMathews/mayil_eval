    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is somewhat aligned with the git diff by suggesting the extension of the `CustomJSONEncoder` class from Flask's `JSONEncoder` and implementing a `default` method to handle `decimal.Decimal`. This matches the git diff's approach to handling `decimal.Decimal` by converting it to a string within the `default` method of the JSON encoder.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE also suggests handling `datetime.datetime` types, which is not part of the issue described nor addressed in the git diff. The git diff does not modify the handling of `datetime` objects, as they were already being handled correctly by Flask's JSON encoder. The RESPONSE's inclusion of `datetime` handling is therefore not relevant to the specific issue of adding support for `decimal.Decimal`.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE does not include the documentation updates that are present in the git diff, which are important for informing users about the changes in version 2.0.2 regarding `decimal.Decimal` support.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a viable solution for the `decimal.Decimal` part of the issue, but it is incomplete and includes irrelevant advice regarding `datetime` handling. Therefore, it partially matches the git diff and is awarded a score of 4.",
