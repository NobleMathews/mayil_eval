{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests making the `element_id` argument of the `json_script` function optional by setting a default value of `None`. The RESPONSE also correctly updates the function logic to conditionally include the `id` attribute in the `<script>` tag only if `element_id` is provided, which is in line with the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes an extra parameter `encoder` in the function signature, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE, as it does not affect the primary issue of making `element_id` optional. The RESPONSE also correctly advises updating documentation and tests, which is a good practice but not explicitly shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the changes needed in the `django/template/defaultfilters.py` file, which are present in the git diff, but this omission does not significantly reduce the utility of the RESPONSE since the primary issue is addressed. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 9 for its high relevance and alignment with the git diff, while acknowledging the slight differences and omissions.",
