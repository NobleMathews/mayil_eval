    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests investigating the `adjust_bbox` function in `_tight_bbox.py`, which is aligned with the git diff that modifies this function. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific actionable guidance on what changes to make within the `adjust_bbox` function. The RESPONSE also suggests checking the `aspect` parameter of `fig.colorbar` and verifying that no parameters are changing the colorbar's size when `bbox_inches` is used. While these are reasonable troubleshooting steps, they do not align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves applying the aspect ratio to the axes locator. The RESPONSE's suggestion to incorporate a workaround into the `savefig` method or to report the issue to the Matplotlib development team does not offer a solution to the problem and does not align with the git diff. The RESPONSE provides some relevant investigation steps but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
