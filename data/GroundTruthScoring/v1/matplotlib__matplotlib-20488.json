{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue of the failing `test_huge_range_log` due to a `ValueError` related to `LogNorm`. It suggests verifying the `LogNorm` implementation, ensuring `autoscale_None` behaves correctly, checking for changes in NumPy, matching CI and local environments, and adding debug logging. These steps are actionable and could lead to identifying the root cause of the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not directly suggest the code change seen in the git diff, which adjusts the handling of `s_vmin` when it is less than or equal to zero in the context of `LogNorm`. However, the RESPONSE's suggestion to verify the `LogNorm` implementation and ensure proper handling of non-positive values is aligned with the intent of the git diff, which is to prevent non-positive values from being passed to `LogNorm`. The RESPONSE also indirectly addresses the git diff by suggesting to check for recent changes in NumPy that might affect the behavior of functions used in normalization, which could include the handling of minimum values.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention the specific code change made in the git diff, which is to set `s_vmin` to `np.finfo(scaled_dtype).eps` when `s_vmin` is less than or equal to zero. However, the RESPONSE's broader approach to troubleshooting the issue is still valuable and relevant. Therefore, the RESPONSE is scored a 7 for its relevance and potential effectiveness in addressing the issue, despite not providing the exact solution from the git diff.",
