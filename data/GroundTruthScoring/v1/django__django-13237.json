{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps and considerations that are relevant to the issue of unnecessary constraint drop/create operations when only the `db_column` attribute is being altered. It suggests modifying the `alter_field` method to skip dropping and creating constraints in such cases, which aligns with the git diff's approach of altering the `_field_should_be_altered` method to prevent unnecessary schema changes. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for special handling in different database backends like SQLite and PostgreSQL, which is in line with the issue's context of database-specific behavior.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly reference the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the deconstruction of the old and new fields and the comparison of their components after popping the `db_column` attribute. Instead, it provides a more general approach to modifying the `alter_field` method and checking for changes in the `db_column` attribute. While the RESPONSE's approach is relevant and could potentially lead to a similar outcome, it does not provide the precise implementation details shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that may be relevant to the issue, but these are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. The RESPONSE's guidance is actionable and relevant, but it does not fully match the git diff's approach, which is why it receives a score of 7.",
