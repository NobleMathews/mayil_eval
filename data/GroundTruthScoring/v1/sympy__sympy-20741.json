    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that a new function `distribute_monom` was added to handle the distribution of rational terms to `MatMul` and that this function was included in the `rules` tuple for canonicalization. The RESPONSE, however, suggests looking into the `MatrixSymbol` class, the `ZeroMatrix` class, and the `block_collapse` function, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the changes shown in the git diff, such as implementing a new function or modifying the canonicalization rules. It does, however, correctly identify that the issue is related to the simplification of matrix expressions, which is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff.",
