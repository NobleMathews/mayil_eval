    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct class (`Subs`) and method (`_eval_subs`) where the issue is located, which is consistent with the git diff. It correctly suggests that the `_eval_subs` method needs to be modified to handle nested substitutions, which is a part of the issue described. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the fix. It lacks the actionable details present in the git diff, such as the use of `has_dups` to check for duplicate variables, the restructuring of the `__new__` method, and the specific changes to the `_hashable_content` and `_eval_subs` methods. The RESPONSE also includes links to the codebase, which could be helpful for a developer, but it does not directly address the issue with concrete solutions. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of providing a full solution to the issue.",
