    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the `set_xindex` method in the `DataArray` and `Dataset` classes, which is consistent with the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a comprehensive implementation of the `set_xindex` and `drop_indexes` methods, including detailed docstrings, parameter handling, and integration with the existing Xarray codebase. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, offers a simplified example that lacks the necessary detail and does not reflect the changes shown in the git diff, such as the handling of custom index classes, the `**options` parameter, and the integration with the `_to_temp_dataset` and `_from_temp_dataset` methods. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests returning a new object with the updated index, which is not reflected in the git diff, as the git diff shows the methods returning the result of `_from_temp_dataset(ds)`, which is a transformation of the current object rather than the creation of a new one. Furthermore, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff, specifically the `_overwrite_indexes` method call, which is not part of the actual implementation. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative approach to the issue.",
