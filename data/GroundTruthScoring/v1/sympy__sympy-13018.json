    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to fixing the issue with noncommutative symbol substitution in the `Pow` class, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests checking the instantiation of the `Symbol` class with `commutative=False` and modifying the `_eval_subs` method to handle noncommutative symbols correctly. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the substitution logic should not assume commutativity.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the fix, which makes it incomplete when compared to the git diff. The git diff offers a comprehensive solution with specific code modifications, including handling of integer powers and the inclusion of a remainder term for noncommutative objects, which the RESPONSE does not mention.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in that it acknowledges the need to adjust the logic for noncommutative symbols, but it lacks the actionable detail and precision of the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
