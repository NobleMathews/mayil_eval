    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general analysis of the issue, suggesting that the AttributeError is related to a bounding box object being `None`. It offers a series of steps to troubleshoot the problem, such as ensuring `fig.tight_layout()` is called at the appropriate time, checking the blitting setup, and reviewing recent changes in the problematic commit. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes to the `collections.py` file, including the introduction of a new `_has_offsets` attribute and modifications to the `get_datalim` method to handle cases when `offsets` are not provided. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the introduction of the `_has_offsets` attribute, which is a key element in the git diff. Instead, it focuses on the order of operations and blitting, which, while related to the animation issue, do not directly address the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the implementation of the changes in the git diff. Therefore, it is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
