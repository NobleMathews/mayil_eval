{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code snippet that aligns well with the git diff's approach to the issue. It suggests using `__main__.__spec__` to determine if the `-m` option was used, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to check `__main__.__spec__.parent` to determine the package name, which matches the git diff's solution. However, the RESPONSE includes additional checks such as `spec.name == \"__main__\"` or `spec.name.endswith(\".__main__\")`, which are not present in the git diff. While these checks do not necessarily conflict with the git diff, they introduce complexity that is not required by the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets for further review, which is helpful but not directly related to the changes needed. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it includes additional unnecessary checks, which is why it does not score a perfect 10.",
