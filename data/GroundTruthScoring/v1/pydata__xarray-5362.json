    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a check for the existence of dimensions in the `weighted` method of `DataArray` and `Dataset` classes before creating a `DataArrayWeighted` or `DatasetWeighted` object, which is in line with the git diff that introduces a `_check_dim` method to perform such a check. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the `_check_dim` method should be used to raise an error when dimensions do not exist, which aligns with the git diff's addition of this method to the `Weighted` class. However, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the `weighted` method in `xarray/core/dataarray.py` and `xarray/core/dataset.py` to include the dimension check, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff instead adds the dimension check directly within the `_implementation` method of the `DataArrayWeighted` and `DatasetWeighted` classes. While the RESPONSE's suggestion is a valid alternative approach to solving the issue, it does not match the git diff's approach of where to place the dimension check. Therefore, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance but does not perfectly align with the git diff's approach, warranting a score of 7.",
