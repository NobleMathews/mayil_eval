    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the correct file and method where the issue occurs, which is relevant to the problem. However, it suggests an incorrect fix by advising to use `raise exc_info[1]`, which does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the variable name was changed from `_bg_loading_exc_info` to `_bg_loading_exc` and that the exception is now stored directly in the variable, rather than as part of a tuple. The RESPONSE fails to recognize this change and instead suggests using an index to access the exception, which is not applicable in the context of the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that would lead to the correct resolution of the issue, as it does not match the approach taken in the git diff.",
