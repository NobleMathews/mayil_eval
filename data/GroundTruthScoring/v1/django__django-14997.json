    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests that the issue with the unique constraint might be due to unsupported features in SQLite and provides general advice on checking SQLite version compatibility, modifying the UniqueConstraint, reporting the issue to Django, and considering removing the constraint or using a different database backend. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or actionable steps that align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `rename_table_references` method in `ddl_references.py`, where the expressions are relabeled with a new table name using the `relabeled_clone` method instead of manually altering each column's alias. The RESPONSE does not mention this method or the specific file that was modified in the git diff, and it does not address the actual code change that was made to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses the unique constraint issue but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
