    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance to resolve the issue described. It suggests reviewing the code and identifying the logic that handles doctest collection for `__init__.py` files, which is a generic approach and does not offer specific instructions aligned with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a list of code snippets to check, none of which are relevant to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE fails to address the specific change needed in the `src/_pytest/main.py` file, which involves modifying the condition to check if the `matching[0]` is an instance of `Package` before yielding the doctest. The RESPONSE does not mention this critical aspect of the fix and instead provides general advice and irrelevant code snippet references. Therefore, it does not align with the git diff and does not assist the developer in fixing the issue.",
