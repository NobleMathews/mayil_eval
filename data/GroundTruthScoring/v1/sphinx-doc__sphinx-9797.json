    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests enabling the `autodoc_inherit_docstrings` configuration variable in the `conf.py` file to address the issue of Sphinx not inheriting documentation for a classmethod when it is overridden in a child class. While this suggestion is related to the topic of documentation inheritance in Sphinx, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates a change in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file, specifically modifying the behavior of the `getdoc` function to handle the inheritance of documentation more effectively. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying any code, which is a key aspect of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that might be relevant to the issue, but these do not offer direct actionable steps to resolve the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a low score.",
