    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with Django's `MultiPartParser` not handling filenames with double quotes correctly but suggests modifying the wrong function (`parse_header_parameters` in `django/utils/http.py`) instead of the correct location (`parse_header` in `django/http/multipartparser.py`) as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does correctly identify that the issue is related to the handling of the `Content-Disposition` header and the need to trim double quotes from the filename parameter. However, it fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which moves the decoding logic to after the removal of double quotes. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links to code snippets that are not directly related to the fix required. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
