    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps to investigate and potentially resolve the stack overflow issue described in the ISSUE. It suggests reviewing the `eliminate_word` function for infinite recursion, implementing a maximum recursion depth check, converting recursive algorithms to iterative ones, and checking for mutual recursion. These are all valid approaches to debugging a stack overflow caused by recursion. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the changes made in the GIT DIFF, which involve modifying a comparison operation from 'is' to '==' in `zero_mul_simp` and removing a commented-out print statement in `rewritingsystem.py`. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or files, and instead focuses on a broader approach to resolving recursion issues. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE, it does not closely match the GIT DIFF's approach to the issue, which is why it receives a score of 4.",
