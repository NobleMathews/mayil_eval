    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a validation check for the event type string in the `mpl_connect` method and raising a `ValueError` if the event type string is not recognized. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which introduces a mechanism to validate signals in the `CallbackRegistry` class. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as adding a `signals` parameter to the `CallbackRegistry` constructor and modifying various classes to pass specific signals to their callback registries.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes code snippets that are not directly relevant to the implementation of the fix. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to add a validation check is relevant, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff's approach to the issue. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `CallbackRegistry` or the need to pass a list of signals to it, which are key elements of the git diff.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue. It scores a 2 as it provides a high-level solution concept that is partially aligned with the git diff but does not offer a direct or complete solution.",
