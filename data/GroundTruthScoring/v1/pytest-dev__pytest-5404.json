    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides some relevant suggestions but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing configuration files, examining specific files for usage of certain functions, and checking module usage, which are generally good troubleshooting steps but do not provide specific, actionable guidance to address the issue described. The RESPONSE fails to identify the changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of a try-except block around the unwrapping logic and the raising of a PytestWarning. The RESPONSE also incorrectly suggests examining the 'tox.ini' configuration file and the 'stratego/printer.py' file, which are not mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not address the core issue of handling exceptions during the unwrapping process, which is the focus of the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet link that is not relevant to the issue or the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but does not offer actionable steps that align with the git diff's approach to resolving the KeyError issue.",
