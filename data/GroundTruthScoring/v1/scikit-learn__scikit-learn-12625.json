    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting the conversion of a pandas.Series to a 2-dimensional array before passing it to `preprocessing.scale`. This advice is somewhat aligned with the git diff, which modifies the check in `validation.py` to ensure that the `dtypes` attribute of the input array is not empty, thus preventing the TypeError.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific change made in the git diff, which is to check the length of `array.dtypes` rather than just the presence of the `dtypes` attribute. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests reshaping the input, which is a workaround rather than a fix to the underlying issue in the scikit-learn codebase.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially relevant as it provides a solution that could prevent the error for the end-user, but it does not guide the developer to make the necessary changes in the scikit-learn library itself, as shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat helpful but incomplete in the context of fixing the issue in the software repository.",
