    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `groupby` operation to handle NaN values, which is aligned with the issue description. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a specific solution or code changes that match the git diff. Instead, it offers a general approach and points to various code snippets that might be relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE fails to provide the precise changes needed, such as using the `where` method to filter out NaN values and updating the group indices, which are present in the git diff. The RESPONSE does mention the use of the `where` function, but it does not connect this to the correct part of the code or the exact changes required. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff and does not directly address the issue. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the need to handle NaN values, but it lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
