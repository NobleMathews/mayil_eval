{
    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing calls to `ds.indexes.get_unique()` with `ds.xindexes.get_unique()` to avoid the TypeError, and to update any dependent logic or refactor to use a helper function. However, this does not align with the git diff, which modifies the `get_unique` method to use the `id` function for checking uniqueness and updates the `copy_indexes` method to handle pandas indexes correctly.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the internal implementation of the `get_unique` method and the handling of pandas indexes in the `copy_indexes` method. Instead, it suggests a workaround that does not resolve the underlying issue in the codebase.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the git diff provided. The git diff does not involve changes to the 'PandasMultiIndex' class or its imports, which the RESPONSE suggests reviewing.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution to the issue described. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.",
