    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff, addressing the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing `requires_system_checks = []` with `required_system_checks = '__all__'` in various command classes and updating the `handle` method to use `required_system_checks`. However, the git diff provided does not indicate any changes to a variable named `required_system_checks`. Instead, the git diff shows that `requires_system_checks` is being changed from `False` to an empty list `[]` or to `[Tags.staticfiles]` in one instance. Additionally, the git diff includes updates to `django/core/management/base.py` to handle the deprecation of boolean values for `requires_system_checks` and to enforce that it must be a list or tuple, or the special value `__all__`. The RESPONSE does not align with these changes and instead introduces a variable that does not exist in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or addresses the specific issue described.",
