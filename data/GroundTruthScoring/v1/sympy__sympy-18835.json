    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a copy of the list before iteration to avoid modifying the sequence while it is being iterated over by `uniq`. However, this does not address the core issue described, which is to modify the `uniq` function itself to raise a RuntimeError if the sequence changes size during iteration. The git diff shows that the solution involves adding a check within the `uniq` function to ensure the sequence's size remains constant during iteration, and if not, to raise a RuntimeError. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a valid alternative approach to the issue.",
