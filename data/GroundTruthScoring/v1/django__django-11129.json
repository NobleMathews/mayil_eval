    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a workaround to the issue by performing the update in two steps, which is a valid approach but does not directly address the core problem described in the issue or align with the git diff. The git diff shows modifications to the `resolve_ref` method and the addition of a new method `_gen_col_aliases` to handle the error more gracefully within the Django framework itself, rather than changing the way developers write their code. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Django source code or provide a solution that would prevent the error from occurring in the first place. Instead, it offers a way to avoid the error by not using the problematic pattern. While this might be helpful in some contexts, it does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
