    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a pseudo-code outline that closely aligns with the git diff. It correctly suggests modifying the `handle` method to check for environment variables for the username, password, and other required fields, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly advises raising a `CommandError` if the necessary information is not provided and the `--noinput` flag is used, which is consistent with the git diff. The inclusion of pseudo-code provides clear, actionable guidance for implementing the feature. The RESPONSE loses a point because it does not include the exact implementation of using `os.environ.get` for retrieving environment variables, which is present in the git diff. However, it does mention using `os.environ.get` in the pseudo-code, which is why the RESPONSE still scores highly. The RESPONSE also provides additional value by suggesting thorough testing and providing links to relevant code snippets, which, while not part of the git diff, are useful for the developer.",
