{
    "score": 10,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides precise, actionable guidance and directly aligns with every aspect of the git diff or provides a valid, effective alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE offers a detailed explanation and a code snippet that directly aligns with the git diff provided. It addresses the issue of the caches.W002 check not supporting tuples in STATICFILES_DIRS by modifying the `check_cache_location_not_exposed` function to handle tuples correctly. The RESPONSE suggests updating the tuple unpacking to extract the directory path from the second element of the tuple, which is exactly what the git diff does. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a reminder to ensure that the tuple unpacking checks if the first element is a string, which is a good practice even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to relevant code snippets in the Django repository, which could be helpful for the developer to understand the context and verify the changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offers clear guidance, and closely aligns with the git diff, making it deserving of a perfect score.",
