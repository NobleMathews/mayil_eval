    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to address the issue with handling double single quotes in FITS card values, including modifying various functions and regular expressions within the `astropy/io/fits/card.py` file. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the `_strg_comment_RE` regular expression to ensure proper matching at the end of the string and removes the replacement of double single quotes with a single quote in the `_split` method. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader review of several functions and regular expressions without pinpointing the exact changes needed, as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes suggestions for reviewing and potentially modifying functions that are not mentioned in the git diff, such as `_format_value`, `_fix_value`, and the `fromstring` class method. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in that it addresses the general area of the code that needs attention, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a direct solution to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a score of 2, as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff.",
