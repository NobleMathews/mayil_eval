    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests modifying the `ExpressionWrapper.get_group_by_cols` method to exclude constant expressions from the `GROUP BY` clause, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE goes further to provide a specific implementation using an `isinstance` check to determine if `self.expression` is a `Value` instance, and if so, it returns an empty list to prevent constants from being included in `GROUP BY`. This approach is effective and directly addresses the issue described. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that the change does not affect other parts of the code, which is a crucial consideration when modifying existing methods. The reason for not giving a full score of 10 is that the RESPONSE does not include the `alias` parameter in the `get_group_by_cols` method signature as shown in the git diff. However, this is a minor omission and does not significantly detract from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
