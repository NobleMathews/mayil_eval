    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `ABmag` class to override arithmetic operations and ensure the unit type is preserved after addition and subtraction. It also suggests implementing the `.to()` method to handle conversion to `nJy`. While the RESPONSE addresses the issue of arithmetic operations with `ABmag` units not preserving the unit type, it does not align with the git diff's approach to the problem. The git diff does not modify the `ABmag` class or its arithmetic operations; instead, it adds a try-except block within the `to` method of the `FunctionUnitBase` class to handle `UnitConversionError` and provide additional information to the user when the error occurs due to operations with magnitudes. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `ABmag` class and its methods is not supported by the git diff and does not provide a direct solution to the issue described. However, it does touch on the broader topic of unit conversion errors, which is why it receives a score of 2 instead of 0.",
