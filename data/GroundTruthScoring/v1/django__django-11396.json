    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests specifying the type of the constant value in the query by adding an output_field parameter to the Value constructor. This is a reasonable suggestion and could potentially resolve the type ambiguity that might be causing the PostgreSQL error. However, the RESPONSE does not address the core issue that the git diff solves, which is the need to cast the constant value using the Cast function from django.db.models.functions. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the SQLCompiler class to automatically cast Value instances to their specified output_field type when they are used in an order_by clause. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the SQLCompiler class or using the Cast function, which are key elements of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide a complete solution to the issue as described and as fixed by the git diff.",
