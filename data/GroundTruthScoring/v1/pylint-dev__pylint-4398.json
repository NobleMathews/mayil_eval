    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to implement the feature requested in the ISSUE, which includes adding new command-line options and updating the logic in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py`. The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to modify the codebase to add the `--fail-on` option and to adjust the `--fail-under` option. It also provides a pseudo-code example for the `--fail-on` option, which is in line with the git diff's addition of a new option and the logic to handle it.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details. The git diff shows that the `--fail-on` option is added to `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` and not to `pylint/lint/base_options.py` as suggested in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE's pseudo-code does not reflect the actual changes made in the git diff, such as the introduction of `enable_fail_on_messages` and `any_fail_on_issues` methods, and the modification of the exit code logic in `pylint/lint/run.py`. The RESPONSE also incorrectly refers to modifying the `_run_checkers` method, which is not part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide some actionable advice and partially aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue, but it is incomplete and does not accurately reflect the changes made in the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it offers some guidance but is not fully aligned with the git diff.",
