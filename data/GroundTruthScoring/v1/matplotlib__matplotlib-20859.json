{
    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be scored based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 9 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that closely aligns with the git diff. It suggests updating the `Legend` class constructor to accept `SubFigure` as a valid parent by checking against `FigureBase`, which is exactly what the git diff does. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to change the `isinstance` check to include `FigureBase`. The RESPONSE does not include the exact code changes from the git diff, such as the specific error message update, but it effectively communicates the necessary conceptual change. The additional code snippets provided are relevant for understanding the context of the issue and where the changes should be made, although they are not part of the git diff. The RESPONSE is actionable and would assist the developer in resolving the issue.",
