    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests replacing the line `X_embedded = X_embedded / np.std(X_embedded[:, 0]) * 1e-4` with `X_embedded = X_embedded / np.std(np.array(X_embedded)[:, 0]) * 1e-4` to ensure compatibility with the global `transform_output=\"pandas\"` configuration. This suggestion is somewhat relevant to the issue as it addresses the TypeError caused by indexing a pandas DataFrame with a numpy-style index. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. The git diff suggests setting the PCA output to always be a numpy array, regardless of the global configuration, by adding `pca.set_output(transform=\"default\")`. This approach avoids the need to modify the indexing of `X_embedded` and ensures that the rest of the code can operate on a numpy array as expected. The RESPONSE does not mention this solution and instead offers a workaround that may not be as robust or clean as the one provided in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
