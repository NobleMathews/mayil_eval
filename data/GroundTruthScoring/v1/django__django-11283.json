{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and offers actionable guidance to resolve the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff in several ways:\n\n1. It suggests checking for stale permissions in the `auth_permission` table, which is relevant to the issue but not directly addressed in the git diff.\n\n2. It advises ensuring that the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function handles the case where permissions for the new content type already exist. This is in line with the git diff, which adds an exception handling block for `IntegrityError` to deal with existing permissions.\n\n3. The RESPONSE recommends manually deleting conflicting permissions if the issue persists, which is a reasonable step to take before running the migration, although the git diff opts for handling this within the migration script itself.\n\n4. The RESPONSE's suggestion to re-run migrations after resolving the issue is a standard practice and aligns with the intent of the git diff to ensure a successful migration.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It does not match the git diff exactly, as it does not mention the addition of transaction handling or the specific warning message output, but it provides a viable alternative approach to resolving the issue. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
