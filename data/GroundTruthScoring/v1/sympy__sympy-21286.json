{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general outline of steps to update the `Range` class in `sympy/sets/fancysets.py` to handle symbolic arguments correctly, which is aligned with the issue's requirement to make symbolic Range more canonical. It suggests modifying the `_inf` and `_sup` properties, the `reversed` property, and the `_contains` method, as well as ensuring the `size` property behaves correctly, all of which are relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement these modifications. It lacks the precision and actionable details present in the git diff, such as the exact lines to be added or modified, the introduction of new methods like `is_eq`, or the specific conditions and error handling to be implemented. The RESPONSE also does not mention the addition of the `Or` import, which is present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat aligned with the git diff in terms of the areas of the code that need attention but does not offer the level of detail and specificity that would enable a developer to fix the issue effortlessly. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.",
