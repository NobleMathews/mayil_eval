    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several general troubleshooting steps for issues related to `cross_val_predict` and class imbalance, but it does not address the specific problem described in the ISSUE nor does it align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a change in the `_fit_and_predict` function within the `sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py` file, specifically adjusting the default value for 'predict_proba' from an integer to a floating-point number and ensuring the data type of the predictions array matches the predictions data type. The RESPONSE, however, focuses on verifying method parameters, checking the number of splits in `StratifiedKFold`, confirming the solver and class weight in `LogisticRegression`, and other general checks that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. While the RESPONSE might be somewhat relevant in a broader context of troubleshooting `cross_val_predict`, it fails to provide actionable advice that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
