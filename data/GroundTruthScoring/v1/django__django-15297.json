    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed solution that addresses the issue of incorrect representation of Class Based Views (CBVs) in the ResolverMatch object. It suggests updating the __init__ method of the ResolverMatch class to handle CBVs correctly by setting the _func_path to the view_class's module and name if the view_class attribute is present. This aligns with the git diff, which also adds a check for the view_class attribute and updates the func variable accordingly.\n\nThe RESPONSE goes further to suggest updating the __repr__ method to use _func_path for the function representation, which is not explicitly mentioned in the git diff but is a logical extension of the fix and is relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE includes additional changes to the __init__ method that are not present in the git diff, such as the handling of the view_name attribute and the inclusion of captured_kwargs and extra_kwargs in the __repr__ method. While these changes are not incorrect, they are not directly related to the issue described, which focuses on the representation of CBVs.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff. It provides a viable alternative to the git diff by including additional improvements to the ResolverMatch class that are consistent with the goal of fixing the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 8.",
