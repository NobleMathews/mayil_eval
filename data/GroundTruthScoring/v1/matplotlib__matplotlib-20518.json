    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. It suggests verifying the use of 'set_sketch_params()' and its parameters, checking for backend support, and considering alternative backends or reporting the issue. However, it fails to address the specific changes made in the git diff, which involve modifying the 'backend_pgf.py' file to correctly apply sketch parameters when using the PGF backend. The RESPONSE does not mention any code changes or the need to modify the backend implementation, which is the core of the solution provided in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it acknowledges the issue with the PGF backend and sketch parameters, but it lacks actionable content that would help resolve the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.",
