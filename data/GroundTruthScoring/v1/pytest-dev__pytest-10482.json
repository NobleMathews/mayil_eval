    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described, which is about the short test summary not showing the test name when skipping from a fixture. Instead, it provides generic advice that is not related to the problem of the test name not appearing in the summary. The RESPONSE suggests defining or importing `some_condition`, modifying the `pytest.skip` message, ensuring correct usage of the fixture, and reporting the issue as a bug, none of which align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows that the solution involves importing the `skip` module and modifying the `pytest_fixture_setup` function to handle the skip exception differently when not in a 'xunit_setup' fixture. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
