    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests adding a new command-line option to control recursive searching for modules when `implicit-namespaces` is used, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows a refactoring of the `recurse_tree` function and the addition of new functions `walk` and `has_child_module` to handle the directory traversal and module checking logic. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the refactoring of the directory traversal logic into separate functions or the handling of private directories and files. Instead, it proposes a new feature that is not present in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling namespaces and subpackages, it does not offer actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is given a low score for its lack of alignment with the git diff and for not providing a solution that would lead to the same outcome as the changes in the git diff.",
