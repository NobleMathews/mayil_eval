    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new function `is_builtin_type` to check for built-in C types and modifying the `CFunctionObject` class to use this function when handling parameters and return types. It also suggests updating the `handle_signature` method to skip adding cross-references for built-in types. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of handling built-in types in Sphinx documentation, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in multiple files across different domains (C, C++, JavaScript, and Python) and does not indicate the creation of a new function or the specific modifications suggested in the RESPONSE. Instead, the git diff shows changes to the `typerolename` and `rolename` parameters in various classes and the addition of parameters to the `make_xref` and `make_xrefs` methods. The RESPONSE does not provide actionable content that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
