    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the 'classification_report' function to include additional output formats such as 'pd.DataFrame' or 'xr.DataArray', which aligns with the issue's request for more usable output formats. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which implements an 'output_dict' parameter that returns the report as a dictionary rather than integrating with pandas or xarray directly. The RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue but rather a high-level overview of how one might go about adding these features. It does not include the specific code changes needed to implement the feature as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue's desire for more usable output formats but fails to provide actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
