{
    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_release` method in the `SpanSelector` class to ensure that the `onselect` callback is invoked when a span is removed with an \"empty\" click. This is somewhat relevant to the issue described, which is about the `onselect` callback not being called when a span is removed by an \"empty\" click.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff provided. The git diff includes a comprehensive update to the `SpanSelector` and `RectangleSelector` classes, adding a new attribute `ignore_event_outside` and modifying the behavior of the `_release` method to handle cases where the span is removed or cancelled. The RESPONSE does not mention the new attribute or the broader changes to the class behavior.\n\nThe RESPONSE's suggestion to call `onselect(event.xdata, event.xdata)` when a span is removed is not aligned with the git diff, which introduces a more complex logic to handle the span removal and the calling of `onselect`. The git diff also includes changes to other methods and classes, which the RESPONSE does not address.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant suggestion but lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
