    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation and a code snippet that aligns well with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to modify the `EnumSerializer` class to handle the serialization of combined Enum flags, which is the core issue described. The RESPONSE suggests using `enum._decompose` to get the individual flags and then serializing each flag, which is in line with the git diff's approach of handling the serialization of Enum flags.\n\nThe RESPONSE also correctly suggests joining the serialized flags with the bitwise OR operator `|`, which matches the git diff's solution of using \" | \" to join the serialized members. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the necessary imports and provides a code snippet that is relevant and actionable.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the use of the `PY311` constant to handle the compatibility with Python 3.11, which is present in the git diff. This omission means that the RESPONSE does not fully account for the compatibility aspect that the git diff addresses. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, it is not complete in terms of addressing the compatibility issue with Python 3.11.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff, but it is not perfect due to the omission of the compatibility handling. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
