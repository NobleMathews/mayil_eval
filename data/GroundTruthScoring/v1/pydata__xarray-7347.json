    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying the `assign_coords` function and related logic to ensure that coordinate indices are preserved when updating coordinates. It also recommends adding unit tests to cover the expected behavior. While these suggestions are generally relevant to the issue of preserving index information during coordinate assignment, they do not align with the specific changes shown in the git diff. The git diff indicates that the issue was addressed by modifying variable names to avoid conflicts and by passing the `indexes` argument to the `collect_variables_and_indexes` function. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the functions `append_all` and `merge_coords`, which were modified in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It does not provide guidance on the specific changes made in the git diff, which are crucial for resolving the issue.",
