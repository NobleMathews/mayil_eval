    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting to update the docstring of the `QuantileTransformer` class to clarify the impact of the `n_quantiles` parameter. It aligns with the git diff in terms of updating the documentation to reflect the correct default value and the behavior when `n_quantiles` is greater than the number of samples. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the actual code changes that are present in the git diff, such as the addition of a warning when `n_quantiles` is greater than `n_samples`, the setting of `self.n_quantiles_` to the minimum of `n_quantiles` and `n_samples`, and the update to the `fit` method to use `self.n_quantiles_` instead of `self.n_quantiles`. The RESPONSE also includes unnecessary information about testing the changes by building the documentation, which is not directly related to the code changes required to fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and is incomplete in terms of the code changes needed to resolve the issue.",
