    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution that aligns with the git diff and addresses the issue described. It offers clear, actionable guidance for renaming the module, refactoring the class to use a dictionary for storing global parameters, and implementing the necessary methods and properties. The RESPONSE also includes context manager functionality and instructions for updating references throughout the codebase, which is in line with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately describes the steps needed to refactor the `core.evaluate` module into `core.parameters`, which is exactly what the git diff shows. It provides a detailed explanation of how to implement the `__getitem__`, `__setattr__`, and `__getattr__` methods, as well as how to create properties for each global parameter. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes the implementation of context manager functionality for the parameters, which is also reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE's instructions for updating references to `global_parameters.evaluate` and `global_parameters.distribute` throughout the codebase are consistent with the changes made in the git diff. Furthermore, the RESPONSE's mention of updating module imports in other files to reflect the new module name aligns with the git diff's changes to various import statements.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a complete and accurate solution that matches the git diff's approach to resolving the issue. It offers a clear and actionable guide for developers to implement the suggested changes, making it highly valuable for fixing the issue.",
