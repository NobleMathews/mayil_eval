    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `DefaultValue.__repr__` method to handle `None` values and updating the `update_defvalue` function to handle `None` values in `kw_defaults` for keyword-only arguments. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `DefaultValue.__repr__` method. Instead, the git diff focuses on modifying the `update_defvalue` function to correctly pop `None` values from `kw_defaults` when a keyword-only argument with an empty default is encountered. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. The RESPONSE's suggestion to modify the `DefaultValue.__repr__` method is not supported by the git diff and does not address the core issue described. The RESPONSE's proposed changes to the `update_defvalue` function are also not aligned with the git diff's solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue as described and represented by the git diff.",
