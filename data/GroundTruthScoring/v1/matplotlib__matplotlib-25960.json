    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE identifies the issue with `wspace` and `hspace` parameters in `Figure.subfigures` not affecting the layout and suggests checking if these parameters are being used within the `subfigures` method. It also suggests ensuring that the `constrained_layout` engine respects these parameters when calculating the layout. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable changes to the code that would resolve the issue. It does not mention the addition of `left`, `right`, `bottom`, and `top` parameters to the `GridSpec` call or the subsequent adjustments to the subfigure transformations, which are key elements in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it correctly identifies the area of the code that needs attention but lacks the actionable content present in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
