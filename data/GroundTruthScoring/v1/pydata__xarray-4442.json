    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results. It suggests updating xarray and pandas, using isel to select data without a MultiIndex, or manually creating a MultiIndex in pandas, none of which are related to the actual fix required in the code. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the to_index method in the xarray/core/coordinates.py file to correctly handle the creation of a MultiIndex when there are multiple dimensions, including a stacked dimension. The RESPONSE does not address this solution and instead provides general advice and links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the fix. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any value in assisting a developer to fix the issue as described.",
