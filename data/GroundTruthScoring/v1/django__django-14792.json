{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying and potentially modifying the `DatabaseOperations._prepare_tzname_delta()` method and the `TimezoneMixin.get_tzname()` method, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the change needed to fix the issue is within the `_get_timezone_name()` function in the `django/utils/timezone.py` file, not in the database backend or the `TimezoneMixin` class.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the specific change in the `_get_timezone_name()` function that the git diff suggests, which is to return the offset for fixed offset timezones or the name of the timezone if not set. Instead, it focuses on the backend database operations and the `TimezoneMixin` class, which are not directly related to the fix shown in the git diff.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE does provide some general guidance on checking and modifying code related to timezones, it does not offer actionable advice that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
