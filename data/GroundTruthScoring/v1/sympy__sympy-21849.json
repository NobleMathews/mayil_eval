    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_print_LambertW` method in the LaTeX printer to handle the 'exp' keyword argument, which is in line with the issue described. However, the RESPONSE incorrectly refers to `sympy/printing/octave.py` instead of `sympy/printing/latex.py`, which is where the actual changes need to be made according to the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests implementing a `_do_exponent` method, which is not present in the git diff and is not necessary for the fix. The git diff shows that the correct approach is to modify the `_print_LambertW` method to accept an optional `exp` argument and to format the output accordingly, which the RESPONSE does not fully align with. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of handling the formatting within the `_print_LambertW` method itself. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
