    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable advice that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. It should address the specific issue described and be relevant given the issue and the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides general troubleshooting steps for issues with Django's autoreloader in a Docker environment, such as ensuring proper volume configuration, checking `inotify` limits, and verifying Django settings. However, these suggestions do not align with the git diff provided, which includes specific code changes to the autoreloader functionality in Django.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not address the code changes in the git diff, such as the modifications to the `ensure_echo_on` function, the error handling in the `run` method, the refactoring of the `tick` method in the `StatReloader` class, or the addition of the thread name in the `start_django` function. Instead, it focuses on environmental and configuration issues that are not directly related to the code changes necessary to fix the issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide actionable advice that would lead to the implementation of the changes shown in the git diff. It also does not offer an alternative solution that would achieve the same result as the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not aligned with the git diff and does not effectively address the specific issue described.\n\nThe RESPONSE does mention checking the code in the `autoreload.py` file, which is relevant to the issue, but it does not provide specific guidance on what changes to make, which is why it receives a score of 1 instead of 0.",
