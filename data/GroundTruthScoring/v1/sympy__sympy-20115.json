    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a workaround for the issue by suggesting the creation of a custom `frac` function and mapping it in the `lambdify` function's modules argument. This is actionable advice that could potentially resolve the user's issue with the `frac` function not being recognized. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the `sympy/printing/pycode.py` file, including the addition of a `_print_frac` method and the mapping of the 'frac' function to 'frac' in the `_known_functions_mpmath` dictionary. The RESPONSE does not mention updating the `sympy` library code to include support for the `frac` function, which is the approach taken in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE offers a workaround that could be helpful, it does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the `sympy` library itself to fix the issue. The RESPONSE is partially relevant as it addresses the issue of the `frac` function not being recognized, but it is incomplete as it does not suggest changes to the library that would permanently resolve the issue for all users.",
