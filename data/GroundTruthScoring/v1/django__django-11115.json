    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking if `django_browserid` is attempting to register the `Site` model and modifying the `copy_registry` function to prevent `AlreadyRegistered` exceptions by using an `is_registered` method. It also suggests modifying the `AlreadyRegistered` exception message to include more details about the already-registered model.\n\nThe RESPONSE is partially aligned with the git diff in that it addresses the need to provide more information when an `AlreadyRegistered` exception occurs. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of modifying the `register` method in `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` to enhance the exception message. Instead, it suggests modifying the `copy_registry` function in `django_browserid/admin.py` and the `AlreadyRegistered` exception in `django/contrib/admin/exceptions.py`, which are not part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not provide a direct solution to the issue as the git diff does, but it does offer a somewhat relevant alternative approach to prevent the exception by checking registration status before attempting to register a model. However, this does not address the issue's request for more detailed exception messages when a clash occurs.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. It offers a preventive measure rather than enhancing the exception message as the git diff does. Therefore, it is scored a 4 as it is incomplete and partially relevant to the issue.",
