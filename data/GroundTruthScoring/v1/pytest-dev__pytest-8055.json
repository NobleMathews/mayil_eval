    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of how to implement the feature of setting `sys.unraisablehook` in pytest, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, it lacks specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests defining a custom function to handle unraisable exceptions and setting `sys.unraisablehook` to this custom function, which is a correct approach but does not provide the detailed implementation that is present in the git diff. The git diff includes the creation of two new files, `threadexception.py` and `unraisableexception.py`, which contain specific context managers and hook implementations to handle unraisable exceptions and thread exceptions. The RESPONSE does not mention the handling of thread exceptions, which is a significant part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not include the necessary updates to the warning types and the pytest initialization file, which are present in the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks the detailed and actionable content needed to fully address the ISSUE and align with the git diff.",
