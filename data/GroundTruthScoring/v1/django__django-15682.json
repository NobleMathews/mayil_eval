    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the need to change the default values of `nulls_first` and `nulls_last` to `None` in the `__init__` method signature, which aligns with the git diff. It also suggests removing the `raise ValueError` line, which is not exactly what the git diff does, but it is implied that this line will be replaced with a deprecation warning, as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention adding the deprecation warning, which is a key part of the git diff, hence it does not fully align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also suggests adjusting the `as_sql` method, which is not mentioned in the git diff, but it is a reasonable assumption that this method might need adjustments based on the changes to the `__init__` method. However, the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on how to handle the `reverse_ordering` method changes, which are a significant part of the git diff. Overall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear guidance that closely aligns with the git diff but is not complete in addressing all the changes shown in the git diff.",
