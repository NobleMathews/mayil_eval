{
    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the cases where `info` should and should not be linked to a new object, which aligns with the intent of the issue. It also acknowledges that the current implementation may not be behaving as desired and suggests that adjustments may be needed. This is in line with the git diff, which introduces a `finalize` parameter to the `_new_view` method to control the propagation of `info`. The RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes but offers a conceptual solution that is consistent with the git diff's approach. The RESPONSE is missing the explicit mention of the `finalize` parameter and the specific changes to the arithmetic operations, which is why it does not score higher. However, it does provide a clear understanding of the issue and a direction for a solution that would likely lead to similar code changes as those in the git diff.",
