    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches more elements of the git diff's approach to the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests checking and modifying the `__new__` method in the `AppliedUndef` class to handle nullary functions and to ensure that `nargs` includes `0` if the function is supposed to handle nullary functions. While this is a reasonable approach to handle functions with no arguments, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff modifies the `Function` class to handle the evaluation of functions with arguments and to avoid the `ValueError` when `args` is an empty sequence by checking if `result.args` is not empty before proceeding with the evaluation logic. The RESPONSE does not address the evaluation logic or the specific error that occurs when `max()` or `min()` is called on an empty sequence, which is the core of the issue described. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the handling of nullary functions but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide a solution to the specific error encountered.",
