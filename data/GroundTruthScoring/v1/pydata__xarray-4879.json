    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests confirming file deletion and investigating caching mechanisms within `open_dataset` or the Jupyter environment, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of caching in a Jupyter notebook. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the issue was resolved by modifying the `FileManager` class in `xarray` to include a unique `manager_id` for each instance, ensuring that each call to `CachingFileManager` opens files separately. The RESPONSE does not mention or address the changes made to the `FileManager` class or the introduction of a unique identifier to prevent caching issues. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests checking the `repr` function for caching issues, which is not supported by the git diff and does not appear to be the root cause of the issue based on the diff provided. The RESPONSE is only given a score of 2 because it does mention the possibility of caching issues, which is tangentially related to the actual fix, but it fails to provide actionable steps that would lead to the resolution demonstrated in the git diff.",
