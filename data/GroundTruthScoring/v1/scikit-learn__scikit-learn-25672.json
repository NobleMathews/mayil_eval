    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the `_check_dcg_target_type` function to include 'binary' as a supported format if `y_true` has more than one sample and updating the error message accordingly. It also suggests adding a check in `ndcg_score` to handle the case when `y_true` is binary and has only one sample, raising a ValueError with an appropriate message.\n\nHowever, the git diff provided does not include any changes to the `_check_dcg_target_type` function or its error message. Instead, the git diff adds a new check in the `ndcg_score` function to raise a ValueError when `y_true` has more than one dimension and the second dimension has a size less than or equal to one, which is a different approach to solving the issue.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to the issue. It offers a different solution that is not supported by the git diff. While the RESPONSE's suggestion to handle binary `y_true` with a single sample is somewhat relevant to the issue, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff's solution.",
