    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests ensuring that the custom method is correctly overriding the built-in method and provides a generic example of how to override a method in a Django model. However, it does not address the specific issue of the inability to override the get_FIELD_display method due to changes in Django 2.2+. The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff, which shows a modification in the Django source code to conditionally set the get_FIELD_display method only if it has not already been set by the user's model class. The RESPONSE does not offer a solution that would allow the user to override the method as desired, nor does it suggest modifying the Django source code as the git diff does. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it discusses overriding methods in Django models, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution.",
