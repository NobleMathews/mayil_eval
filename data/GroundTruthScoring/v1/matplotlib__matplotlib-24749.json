    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changing the way the function is called by the user, which does not address the underlying issue in the codebase. The git diff indicates that the actual fix involves modifying the `contour.py` file to handle cases where arguments are provided, and to correctly process the number of arguments given. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff as it does not suggest any code changes to the `contour.py` file, nor does it provide an alternative solution that would fix the issue in the codebase. Instead, it incorrectly suggests that the user should change their usage of the API, which is not a solution to the reported bug. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance to fix the issue in the software repository and is not aligned with the git diff.",
