    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests verifying the `autodoc_type_aliases` setting and ensuring it is used correctly, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the `get_type_hints` function calls in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to include `self.config.autodoc_type_aliases` as an argument, which the RESPONSE fails to mention.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests checking specific classes in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` and reporting the issue to the Sphinx issue tracker if it persists. This advice does not align with the git diff, which does not involve changes to `inspect.py` or reporting a bug. Instead, the git diff indicates that the issue can be resolved by code changes within the project.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE does not provide the necessary guidance to fix the issue as per the git diff and lacks actionable steps that would lead to the resolution of the problem described in the issue.",
