    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the queryset used in the `ModelMultipleChoiceField` to handle the case when no selections are made by using `QuerySet.none()` to return an empty queryset. This is somewhat relevant to the issue, as it addresses the problem of all objects being added when no selections are made. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff, which shows changes to the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file to ensure that `QuerySet.none()` works correctly on combined queries by cloning the combined queries and setting them empty when necessary. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the Django internals or the need to clone combined queries, which is a key part of the git diff's solution. Instead, it focuses on handling the form submission logic in the application code, which is a different approach and does not address the underlying issue with `QuerySet.none()` on combined queries. The provided code snippets and links to check are somewhat relevant but do not offer actionable guidance in the context of the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
