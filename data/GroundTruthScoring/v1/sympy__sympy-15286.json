    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section, which is about adding functionality to the Ellipse class in SymPy to handle equations of ellipses with a given slope for the major axis. Instead, the RESPONSE discusses extending the integrate function or the Integral class to recognize integrals that can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals, which is unrelated to the changes shown in the GIT DIFF.\n\nThe GIT DIFF shows modifications to the Ellipse class to add a new parameter '_slope' to the 'equation' method, allowing it to return the equation of an ellipse with a major axis having that slope. The RESPONSE, however, provides a high-level overview and a simplified example of how to extend the integrate function to recognize a specific form of an elliptic integral, which is not relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes required to fix the issue. As a result, it should receive a score of 0.",
