    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE correctly identifies the issue with the `lambdify` function misinterpreting the symbolic identity matrix `Identity(n)` as the complex number `I`. It suggests modifying the `_print_Identity` method in `sympy/printing/pycode.py`, which is aligned with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE also includes the correct code snippet that needs to be added to handle the printing of identity matrices with integer dimensions, which matches the git diff.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE suggests using `numpy.identity` for symbolic dimensions, which is not part of the git diff. The git diff specifically raises a `NotImplementedError` for symbolic matrix dimensions, indicating that this functionality is not yet supported. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the global namespace used by `_lambdifygenerated` to handle the `'I'` mapping, which is not mentioned in the git diff and may not be necessary given the changes to the `_print_Identity` method.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides actionable advice and closely matches the git diff, but it includes additional suggestions that are not supported by the git diff. Therefore, it does not fully align with every aspect of the git diff, warranting a score of 7.",
