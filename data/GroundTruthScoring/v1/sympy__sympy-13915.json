    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to fix the issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using the `limit` function to handle the undefined expression when substituting `b` with `a`. However, the git diff indicates that the solution involves modifying the `_gather` function in `sympy/core/mul.py` to handle cases where an expression evaluates to NaN due to the cancellation of infinities. The RESPONSE does not address the actual code change needed in the `sympy` library to fix the issue. Instead, it suggests a workaround for the user's code, which does not align with the git diff's approach of modifying the library's internal behavior. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section on checking code snippets related to integrals, which is not relevant to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not help in resolving the issue as described.",
