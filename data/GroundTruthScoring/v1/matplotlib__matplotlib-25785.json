    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the '_get_papertype' function to sort paper sizes by area and remove the conditional check for paper sizes starting with 'l'. While this change might improve the sorting logic, it does not align with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the 'papertype' parameter is being deprecated and that a warning should be issued when 'auto' is used. Additionally, the git diff shows changes to the handling of paper sizes for EPS files and updates to the 'ps.papersize' validation. The RESPONSE does not address these aspects of the issue and instead focuses on a different approach that is not supported by the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the issue of paper size selection but fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach to the issue.",
