    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice by suggesting a modification to the `django/conf/global_settings.py` file to include `.localhost` in the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list when `DEBUG=True`. This aligns with the intent of the git diff, which is to allow subdomains of localhost in DEBUG mode. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the exact file and location of the change. The git diff shows a change in `django/http/request.py`, not `django/conf/global_settings.py`. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests appending `.localhost` to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list, which is consistent with the git diff's addition of `.localhost`. The RESPONSE also provides a code snippet and additional context about where to place the change, which is helpful but not entirely accurate as per the git diff. The RESPONSE is relevant and provides some guidance but does not fully align with the git diff's approach.",
