    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed and accurate solution to the issue of implementing the RMSE metric and scorer in the sklearn project. It correctly suggests modifying the `mean_squared_error` function to accept a `squared` parameter and adding a new scorer `neg_root_mean_squared_error`. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets that closely match the git diff, such as the addition of the `squared` parameter in the function signature and the conditional return of the square root of the MSE. Furthermore, the RESPONSE provides additional valuable guidance on updating documentation, tests, and ensuring the new scorer is imported correctly, which aligns with best practices in software development. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it suggests adding the scorer to an `__ALL__` list in `_regression.py`, which is not present in the git diff. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
