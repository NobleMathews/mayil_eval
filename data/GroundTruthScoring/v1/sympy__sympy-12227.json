    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a somewhat relevant approach to the issue by suggesting the addition of new keyword arguments `dps` and `prec` to the `Float` constructor and deprecating the old behavior of using `prec` for decimal precision. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff in several ways:\n\n1. The RESPONSE suggests issuing a `SymPyDeprecationWarning` with an `issue` parameter and `deprecated_since_version`, which is not present in the git diff.\n\n2. The RESPONSE incorrectly states to delete the `precision` keyword argument, while the git diff actually uses it and does not delete it.\n\n3. The RESPONSE does not include the changes to the `_print_Float` method in `sympy/printing/repr.py` as shown in the git diff.\n\n4. The RESPONSE includes a code snippet that is not fully aligned with the git diff, such as the handling of the `precision` variable and the default value setting.\n\n5. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the detailed error handling and the conversion logic between decimal and binary precision.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a general direction that is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks the actionable content and detailed alignment with the git diff necessary to fully resolve the issue.",
