{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests initializing the `deleted_counter` with all models set to zero before the deletion process begins. This approach is different from the git diff, which only increments the `deleted_counter` if the `count` is not zero after attempting to delete objects. While the RESPONSE's suggestion could potentially address the issue of inconsistent results, it does not align with the git diff's approach of conditionally updating the counter. The RESPONSE's method would lead to all models being represented in the `deleted_counter` with an initial count of zero, which is not the behavior shown in the git diff. The git diff ensures that the counter is only incremented if there is a non-zero deletion count, which avoids adding unnecessary entries with zero counts to the `deleted_counter`. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff and offers an alternative that is not as effective as the solution in the git diff. The RESPONSE is given a score of 2 because it attempts to address the issue but does so in a way that is not aligned with the git diff and is less effective.",
