    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and does not provide a viable alternative solution to the issue described. The RESPONSE suggests adding code that does not match the changes in the git diff and introduces incorrect logic, such as the incorrect placement of the args_cnc() method call and the incorrect loop structure. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant links and references to code snippets that do not contribute to resolving the issue. Overall, the RESPONSE fails to offer any accurate guidance or meaningful information that would aid in resolving the issue, and it does not reflect the necessary changes represented in the git diff.",
