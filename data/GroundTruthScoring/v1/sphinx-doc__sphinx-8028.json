    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the steps needed to document instance attributes with autosummary, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests modifying the `Autosummary` class and updating the `get_items` method, which aligns with the git diff's approach of handling instance attributes. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to handle instance attributes in the `Documenter` class and its subclasses, which is in line with the git diff's addition of `INSTANCEATTR` to the import statement in `__init__.py`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific code changes or detailed guidance on how to implement the feature, which makes it less actionable than the git diff. The git diff includes concrete code modifications, such as the addition of the `import_ivar_by_name` function and changes to the `import_by_name` usage, which are not mentioned in the RESPONSE. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating templates, which is not part of the git diff, and it does not mention the new `import_by_name` method added to the `Autosummary` class in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a section on 'Code snippets to check' with links to a GitHub repository, which is not directly related to the solution and does not provide value in the context of the git diff. This section seems to be more of a general guidance on where to find relevant code rather than specific instructions on what to change.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it scores a 3.",
