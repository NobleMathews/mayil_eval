    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described. The git diff shows changes made to the scorer.py file to handle cases where a classifier's predict_proba method returns a shape that is not compatible with binary classification scoring. The RESPONSE, however, suggests that the GMM model is being used for clustering, not classification, and discusses implementing a custom scoring function or switching to a different classification algorithm. This advice is not relevant to the issue at hand, which is about modifying the scorer.py file to handle certain shapes of predict_proba output correctly. The RESPONSE does not offer any actionable guidance that would help in resolving the IndexError caused by an incorrect assumption about the shape of y_pred in the scorer.py file. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting a developer to fix the issue and receives a score of 0.",
