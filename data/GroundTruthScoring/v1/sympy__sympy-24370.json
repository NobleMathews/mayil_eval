    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests two alternative approaches to avoid the error: using `sympy.Rational(1024, s0)` or `1024 // s0`. While these suggestions might be valid workarounds in some contexts, they do not address the underlying issue in the sympy library's code that is causing the error. The git diff indicates that the actual fix involves modifying the `__floordiv__` method in the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file to return the result of `divmod(self, other)[0]` without wrapping it in an `Integer` object. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the library's code, which is the core of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it provides a workaround, but it lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue.",
