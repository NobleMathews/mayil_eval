    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the specific issue described in the ISSUE section. The issue is related to a bug in the rendering of graphs in Matplotlib after an upgrade, but the RESPONSE suggests generic troubleshooting steps that are not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by adding a deprecation warning when passing *transOffset* without *offsets* and setting transOffset to None if offsets are not provided. The RESPONSE fails to mention or address this change and instead provides general advice and unrelated code snippets. There is no actionable guidance that matches the git diff or the context of the issue, making the RESPONSE entirely unhelpful for resolving the described problem.",
