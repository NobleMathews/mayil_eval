{
    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a comprehensive guide on how to implement the feature of setting Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite attributes on the language cookie in a Django project. It aligns closely with the git diff by suggesting the addition of the same settings in `django/conf/global_settings.py` and the use of these settings in `django/views/i18n.py` when setting the cookie. The RESPONSE also goes beyond the git diff by suggesting the addition of system checks and updating the documentation, which are not part of the git diff but are good practices. The RESPONSE does not exactly match the git diff in terms of the code snippets provided, as it includes additional steps such as overriding settings in `settings.py` and adding system checks, which are not present in the git diff. However, these additional steps do not detract from the utility of the RESPONSE; they provide a more thorough implementation guide. The RESPONSE does not mention updating `django/views/i18n.py` as shown in the git diff, which is a key part of the issue, hence the score is not a perfect 10.",
