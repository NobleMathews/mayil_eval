{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to improving the styling of the version upgrade banner, which is aligned with the issue's goal. It correctly identifies the need to update the title, button label, and body text of the banner to match the application's design standards, which is consistent with the git diff. The RESPONSE also mentions applying CSS adjustments to achieve the desired spacing, which addresses the issue of inconsistent spacing between UI elements.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific instructions on changing the font size of the body text, which is a key aspect of the issue. The git diff shows that the font variant was changed from 'bodyLg' to 'bodyMd', but the RESPONSE only mentions using the standard body font for better readability without specifying the change in font size. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying CSS classes, which is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not mention the change in the gap size from '2' to '4' in the <VerticalStack> component, which is an important part of the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes unnecessary details about testing and initiating a pull request, which, while part of a standard development workflow, do not directly address the issue at hand. Furthermore, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the changes required by the git diff, potentially leading the developer to unrelated parts of the codebase.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that aligns with the git diff but is incomplete and includes some irrelevant details, warranting a score within the 4 to 6 range.",
