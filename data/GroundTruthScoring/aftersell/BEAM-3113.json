{
    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue, including identifying the correct file to modify (`checkout-editor.tsx`), updating the text content of the banner, and adjusting the font size and spacing. These suggestions are in line with the git diff, which shows changes to the text content and spacing in the `CheckoutEditor` component.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific instructions on how to change the font size, which is a key part of the issue. It also suggests adding a new CSS class for margin adjustments, which is not reflected in the git diff. The git diff shows that the spacing was adjusted by changing the `gap` property of the `VerticalStack` component, not by adding a new CSS class.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a lengthy explanation of the testing process and preparation of a pull request, which, while potentially useful, is not directly related to the specific changes required to fix the issue. The RESPONSE also provides a list of code snippets to check, which could be helpful for locating the relevant code but are not necessary for the specific changes outlined in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that aligns with the git diff, but it is incomplete and includes unnecessary details that do not directly address the issue. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.",
