    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice, such as modifying the banner's title, body text, and button label, aligning the font size with the standard used throughout the application, and adjusting the margin below the banner. These suggestions are in line with the git diff, which shows changes to the title, body text, and button label of a banner component in the checkout editor page.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not fully align with the git diff in several ways. It incorrectly assumes the name of the banner component file (`action-needed-banner.tsx`), which is not mentioned in the git diff or the issue description. The git diff directly modifies the `checkout-editor.tsx` file, and there is no evidence to suggest that the banner component is in a separate file.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests adjusting the margin below the banner to match the spacing found between two cards elsewhere in the app. While the git diff does adjust the `VerticalStack` gap from '2' to '4', which is related to spacing, the RESPONSE's advice on margin-bottom is not directly supported by the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to various code snippets, which could be helpful for locating the relevant sections of code. However, these links are to a testbed repository, which may not be the actual repository in question, and the RESPONSE does not provide specific guidance on the changes to be made in these snippets.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some relevant advice but lacks complete alignment with the git diff and contains inaccuracies. Therefore, it scores a 3 as it is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
