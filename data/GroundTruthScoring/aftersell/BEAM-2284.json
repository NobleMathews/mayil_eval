    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to address the specific issue of removing translations from the dashboard content of the UpCart application. It does not provide any guidance or solutions related to the git diff, which shows the removal of translation functions and language detection packages. Instead, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing and removing translation-related code, which is already accomplished in the git diff. It also incorrectly addresses a separate PayPal integration issue, which is not part of the original issue or the git diff. The RESPONSE does not offer any insights or actionable steps that align with the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves code removal for translation features. Therefore, it receives a score of 0.",
