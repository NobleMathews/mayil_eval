    "supporting_evidence": "The response fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff. It does not address the removal of translations from the UpCart dashboard, which is the core of the issue. Instead, it offers generic advice on reviewing the app's codebase, documentation, and payment configuration, which are not directly related to the task of removing translations. The response does not match the git diff's approach to the issue, which involves code changes to remove translation functions and references to the language picker feature. There is no mention of the specific changes required, such as removing the `t()` function calls or updating hardcoded text to English. The response does not provide the clear, actionable steps that are present in the git diff, such as the removal of `useTranslation` hooks, `i18next` configurations, and language-specific JSON files. Therefore, the response is entirely unhelpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue described.",
