    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests changes to the CSS and React component text strings to address the issue of styling in the upsell product modal. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes made directly in the TypeScript files of the React components, adjusting the text capitalization and wrapping a tag in a Box component to address the width issue. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests modifying CSS properties and text strings in a way that does not reflect the actual changes made in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to update text capitalization, but it suggests doing so by updating text strings or using CSS `text-transform`, which is not how the issue was addressed in the git diff. The git diff shows that the text capitalization was changed directly in the JSX by updating the string literals.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the width of the discount tag using CSS, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the git diff shows that the width issue was addressed by wrapping the tag in a Box component, not by changing CSS properties.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the issue but does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It fails to accurately reflect the changes made in the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
