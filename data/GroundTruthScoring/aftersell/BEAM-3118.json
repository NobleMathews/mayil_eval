    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to fixing the styling issues in the upsell product modal, which includes adjusting the width of the discount tag, standardizing text sizes, and harmonizing capitalization. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff shows specific changes made to the React component files, including changing the title capitalization and modifying the variant of the Text component to ensure uniform text sizes. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests locating and modifying CSS classes or inline styles, which is not reflected in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests validating changes and testing the modal, which is good practice but does not directly address the issue or align with the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff, which could lead the developer to irrelevant parts of the codebase. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
