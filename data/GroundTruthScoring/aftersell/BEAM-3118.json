    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides actionable advice that aligns with the git diff in terms of updating text capitalization for modal headers and labels to sentence case. It correctly suggests changing the strings to \"Edit upsell product\", \"Discount settings\", and \"Product settings\" respectively, which matches the git diff changes.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff regarding the font size adjustments for the headings \"Discount Settings\" and \"Product Settings\". The git diff shows that the font variant for \"Discount Settings\" was changed from \"headingSm\" to \"headingMd\" to match the \"Product Settings\" heading, which the RESPONSE fails to mention.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE suggests modifying the width property of the discount tag to fit the content, which is somewhat relevant to the issue of the discount tag being full width. However, the git diff shows that the actual change was to wrap the \"Tag\" component with a \"Box\" component, which the RESPONSE does not mention.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. The RESPONSE does not provide clear guidance on the exact files and lines of code that need to be modified, unlike the git diff which specifies the exact locations of the changes.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice that is partially relevant to the issue and partially matches the git diff, but it is incomplete and does not fully address the specific changes made in the git diff.",
