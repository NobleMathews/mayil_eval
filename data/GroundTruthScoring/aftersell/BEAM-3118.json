    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying CSS properties and updating hardcoded strings or dynamic strings for text capitalization, which is somewhat aligned with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide specific actionable guidance that matches the git diff. The git diff shows changes made directly in the TypeScript files of the React components, adjusting the title and headings' text capitalization and adding a Box component to wrap the discount tag for styling purposes. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests general CSS changes and does not mention the addition of the Box component or the specific file changes shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that do not exist (the provided URLs are placeholders and not actual GitHub links), which could mislead the developer. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
