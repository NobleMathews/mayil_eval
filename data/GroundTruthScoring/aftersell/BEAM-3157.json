    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES offering confidently incorrect solutions or advice not supported by the git diff should be scored as 0. RESPONSES that appear relevant but offer no real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the authentication middleware in `auth-dashboard.middleware.ts` and ensuring the Dockerfile supports new authentication requirements. However, the git diff indicates that the changes needed are in the `rokt.api.ts` file and involve updating the `Authorization` header from using a bearer token to a basic auth token for various API calls. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes shown in the git diff, nor does it provide a viable alternative to the changes needed. Instead, it incorrectly focuses on middleware and Dockerfile configurations, which are not part of the issue or the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer actionable or meaningful guidance to assist the developer in resolving the issue and is confidently incorrect in its approach.",
