    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice by suggesting the use of basic authentication with Base64 encoding, which aligns with the git diff's changes to the authorization headers from Bearer to Basic. It also correctly identifies the need to update the `authService.js` file and provides a code snippet for encoding the credentials, which is relevant to the issue at hand.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the addition of the new environment variable `ROKT_INTEGRATION_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in the schema file, which is a key part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests updating `authService.js`, which is not part of the git diff, and it does not mention the specific changes made to the `rokt.api.ts` file in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes a section with links to code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff or the issue description.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant and offers a partial solution, but it does not fully align with the git diff or provide a complete solution to the issue described.",
