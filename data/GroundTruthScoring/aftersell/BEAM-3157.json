    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to switch from Bearer tokens to Basic authentication, which is aligned with the git diff's changes. It correctly suggests encoding the username and password into a Base64 string and updating the `Authorization` header in the `rokt.api.ts` file. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the new environment variable `ROKT_INTEGRATION_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN` to the `schema.ts` file, which is a critical part of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests retrieving the username and password from 1Password, which is not reflected in the git diff, and it does not provide the exact changes to the code as shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes unnecessary steps, such as reviewing `auth-dashboard.middleware.ts`, which is not part of the git diff, and it provides links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the task at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially aligned with the git diff and offers some actionable advice but is incomplete and includes extraneous information.",
