    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a transition to Basic authentication using Base64 encoded credentials, which aligns with the ISSUE's requirement to switch to EdgeGateway using Basic authentication. However, the RESPONSE does not match the git diff's approach of adding a new environment variable `ROKT_INTEGRATION_BASIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and updating the `Authorization` headers in the `rokt.api.ts` file to use this new variable. Instead, it suggests creating two new environment variables `ROKT_USERNAME` and `ROKT_PASSWORD` and encoding them on the fly within the code, which is not reflected in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes unnecessary steps such as reviewing the `auth-dashboard.middleware.ts` file, which is not mentioned in the git diff or the ISSUE, and provides an extensive list of code snippets to check, which adds no actionable value in the context of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE fails to mention the update to the `EnvVariables` schema in the `schema.ts` file, which is a key part of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the authentication switch but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and it introduces steps that are not supported by the git diff or the ISSUE.",
