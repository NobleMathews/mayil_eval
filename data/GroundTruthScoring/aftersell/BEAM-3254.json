    "criteria": "The RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff. It fails to address the specific issue described and does not offer a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not address the issue of integrating Rokt analytics into the web application's UI. Instead, it provides a generic outline of steps for integrating a feature, which is not specific to the issue at hand. The RESPONSE also includes irrelevant code snippet references and does not provide any actionable guidance or solutions that align with the git diff, which includes specific changes to TypeScript files for the Rokt analytics integration. The git diff shows updates to DTOs, API response types, and the frontend component to display the top advertisers and verticals, none of which are reflected in the RESPONSE.",
