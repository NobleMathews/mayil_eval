    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely matches the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative solution. It does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the addition of type definitions for the Rokt analytics API responses, the update of the return types for the backend API functions, or the implementation of the frontend component to display the top advertisers and verticals data.\n\nInstead, the RESPONSE provides generic steps for enabling a feature flag, updating environment configuration files, and fetching data using hooks, which are not directly related to the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes incorrect code snippets and references to non-existent functions, such as 'setFeatureFlag', which is not part of the git diff or the issue description.\n\nMoreover, the RESPONSE includes a large amount of irrelevant information, such as links to various lines of code in a GitHub repository that are not pertinent to the issue at hand. This information does not contribute to resolving the issue and does not reflect the changes required as per the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE does not offer any insights or actionable steps that would assist a developer in locating and fixing the issue warranting the diff, and therefore it should receive a score of 0.",
