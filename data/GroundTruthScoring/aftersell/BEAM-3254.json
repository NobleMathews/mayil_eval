    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results. It suggests importing a non-existent component called 'TopAdvertisersAndVerticals' and conditionally rendering it based on a feature flag. However, the git diff shows that the actual changes involve updating type annotations for existing functions, adding new types, and updating the 'getAnalytics' function to structure the results correctly. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide a viable alternative solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a large section of irrelevant links to code snippets that do not pertain to the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any value in assisting the developer to fix the issue as described and does not align with the git diff provided.",
