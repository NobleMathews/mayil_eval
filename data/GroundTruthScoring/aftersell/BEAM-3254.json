    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance or relevant information that aligns with the git diff. It offers a general approach to integrating Rokt with the AfterSell Shopify app, which includes steps like updating the database, creating a configuration file, and modifying the frontend and backend components. However, these steps do not align with the specific changes shown in the git diff, which includes updates to TypeScript files for the Rokt API, controller, DTOs, and frontend components to handle the display of top advertisers and verticals analytics data.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes incorrect and irrelevant suggestions, such as updating the Dockerfile and creating a configuration file, which are not part of the git diff or the issue description. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a section with 'Code snippets to check' that references non-existent URLs and does not provide any value in the context of the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE fails to address the specific issue of displaying top advertisers and verticals analytics data in the UI and does not offer any insights or actionable steps that would assist a developer in implementing the necessary changes based on the git diff provided.",
