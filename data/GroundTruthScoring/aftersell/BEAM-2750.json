    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `handleSelection` function in `ProductSelectModal.tsx` to automatically select the first variant when a top-level product is chosen. However, the git diff indicates that the changes were made in `ProductsTable.tsx` and not in `ProductSelectModal.tsx`. The RESPONSE does not mention the `ProductsTable.tsx` file or the `handleOneParentSelection` function, which is where the git diff shows the changes were made.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests adjusting the selection logic for upsells to include all variants when a top-level product is selected, but the git diff does not show any changes related to upsells or the `setSelectedItems` function. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the specific functions and files that were modified.\n\nThe RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of selecting variants for add-ons and upsells, but it lacks actionable content that matches the git diff. It does not provide accurate guidance on the changes needed in the codebase to resolve the issue as per the git diff.",
