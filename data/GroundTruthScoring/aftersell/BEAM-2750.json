    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `handleSelection` function within `ProductSelectModal.tsx` to handle top-level product selections by automatically choosing the first variant. This approach is somewhat aligned with the git diff's intent to handle the selection of the first available variant when a top-level product is selected. However, the RESPONSE does not closely match the git diff's implementation details, which involve adding a new function `getFirstAvailableVariantForProduct` and modifying the `handleOneParentSelection` function within `ProductsTable.tsx`.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that is not present in the git diff, and it suggests using functions like `fetchAllVariants`, `deepCopy`, and `removeOrAddItem`, which are not mentioned in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a list of code snippets to check, which could be somewhat helpful for a developer looking to understand the broader context of the issue, but it does not directly aid in resolving the specific issue at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides a general direction that is somewhat relevant to the issue but lacks the actionable content and specific guidance present in the git diff. It does not directly address the changes made in the git diff, such as the removal of the `IVariables` interface and the addition of the `getFirstAvailableVariantForProduct` function. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and does not offer a complete solution aligned with the git diff.",
