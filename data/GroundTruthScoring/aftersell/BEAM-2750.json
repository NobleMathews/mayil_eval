    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the `handleSelection` function in `ProductSelectModal.tsx` to automatically select the first variant when a top-level product is chosen for add-ons and all variants for upsells. However, the git diff provided shows changes made to the `ProductsTable.tsx` file, specifically adding a new function `getFirstAvailableVariantForProduct` and modifying the `handleOneParentSelection` function to use this new method to select the first available variant for a product. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff in terms of the file or the functions being modified. It also does not provide a code snippet that would directly resolve the issue as the git diff does. The RESPONSE does address the issue of selecting the first variant for add-ons when a top-level product is selected, but it does not do so in a manner that is consistent with the git diff. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and is incomplete in addressing the issue as described.",
