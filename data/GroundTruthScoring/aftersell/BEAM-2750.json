    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing and modifying code in various modules such as `AddonsModule.tsx`, `ProductAddonSettings.tsx`, and `UpsellsModule.tsx` to address the issue of selecting a top-level product in the add-on selection modal. However, the git diff provided shows that the changes were made in `ProductsTable.tsx` and not in the modules mentioned in the RESPONSE. The RESPONSE does not mention the `ProductsTable.tsx` file or the specific logic added to handle the selection of the first available variant for a product, which is the core of the solution in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide a general direction for fixing the issue by suggesting to modify the selection logic to automatically choose the first variant of a top-level product when it is selected as an add-on. This aligns with the intent of the git diff but lacks specificity and actionable steps that match the actual changes made in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead the developer to review unrelated code. The RESPONSE does not provide clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, and therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
