    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES offering confidently incorrect solutions or advice not supported by the git diff should be scored as 0. RESPONSES that appear relevant but offer no real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and does not offer a solution to the issue described. The git diff indicates that a new boolean field `rewardsProductLinkVisible` was added to the settings and the UI, and the logic in `SingleProductRow.tsx` was updated to conditionally render product links based on this setting. The RESPONSE, however, suggests that the issue is related to a missing query parameter in the API call for the \"25% Off Coupon Code\" product, which is not supported by the git diff or the issue description. The RESPONSE also provides incorrect steps for troubleshooting and resolving the issue, such as inspecting the `SingleProductRow.tsx` component for API response processing and checking the database entry for the product title, which are not relevant to the actual problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and links that are not related to the git diff or the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable or meaningful guidance to assist the developer in fixing the issue and is confidently incorrect.",
