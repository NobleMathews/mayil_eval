    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 7 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a series of steps that are relevant to the issue of the reward product link not being clickable and redirecting incorrectly. It suggests investigating and modifying the website's code to allow users to interact with reward items and be directed to the appropriate product pages, which is in line with the git diff's approach to add a new setting for linking reward products.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes the recommendation to modify the click event handler for reward items, which is directly addressed in the git diff with the introduction of the 'shouldHaveRewardProductLink' function in the SingleProductRow.tsx file.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the specific implementation details found in the git diff, such as the addition of the 'rewardsProductLinkVisible' setting in the defaultMetafields.ts file and the corresponding UI component in the RewardsGeneralSettings.tsx file. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff changes, which could potentially lead the developer to investigate unnecessary areas of the code.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is highly relevant and provides actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff's approach, but it lacks the precise implementation details that would make it a perfect match. Therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.",
