    "score": 7,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results, should score between 7 and 9.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a solution that is highly relevant to the issue described. It suggests updating the anchor tag in `SingleProductRow.tsx` to dynamically set the `href` attribute to the reward item's correct URL, which aligns with the git diff's changes to the `SingleProductRow.tsx` file. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need for a conditional statement to evaluate a new merchant-specific setting, which is in line with the git diff's introduction of a new setting `rewardsProductLinkVisible`.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not mention the addition of the `useCallback` hook or the exact implementation of the `shouldHaveRewardProductLink` function as shown in the git diff. It also does not include the changes to the `defaultMetafields.ts` file or the `RewardsGeneralSettings.tsx` file, which are part of the git diff and relevant to the issue. The RESPONSE does provide a general direction for the fix and mentions the need for a function to check the merchant's setting, but it does not provide the specific implementation details that are present in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE is not a perfect match to the git diff, but it does offer a viable alternative approach to achieving the same result, which is to allow customers to click on reward products in the cart to access their product pages. Therefore, it is scored as a 7 for providing clear guidance that is highly relevant and closely aligns with the git diff.",
