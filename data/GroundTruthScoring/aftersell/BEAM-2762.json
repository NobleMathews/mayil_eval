    "score": 8,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. A score of 8 indicates that the RESPONSE is highly relevant, offering clear guidance or solutions that closely align with the git diff or achieve similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a clear and actionable solution to the issue of making the first reward item in the cart clickable and directing to its landing page. It suggests reviewing the code that manages click events on reward items, introducing a conditional check for a merchant-specific setting, confirming correct URL redirection, and testing the changes. This aligns well with the git diff, which adds a new boolean setting 'rewardsProductLinkVisible' to control the visibility of the product link for reward items and modifies the 'SingleProductRow.tsx' to use this setting to determine whether to enable or disable the link.\n\nThe RESPONSE also provides specific code snippets to check, which are relevant to the issue at hand. It mentions the 'SingleProductRow.tsx' file, which is directly modified in the git diff, and the 'defaultMetafields.ts' file, where the new setting is added. The RESPONSE does not mention the 'RewardsGeneralSettings.tsx' file, which is also modified in the git diff to include a new field for the setting, but this omission does not significantly detract from the overall relevance and utility of the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a viable alternative approach to the git diff, focusing on the same key elements of the issue and providing actionable steps for resolution. It does not match the git diff exactly but achieves the same result, which is to make the reward product link clickable based on a merchant-specific setting.",
