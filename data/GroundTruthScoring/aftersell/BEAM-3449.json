    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the specific issue described.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to integrating Rokt ads with Intercom, including checks for feature flags and maintaining records of user interactions. However, it does not provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a simple addition of a property to an object being passed to a function, which is a direct and specific change to surface the Rokt ads enablement to Intercom. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader set of actions and references multiple code snippets that are not directly related to the change shown in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant in discussing feature flags and user eligibility, it lacks the specificity and direct relevance to the git diff that would make it highly valuable. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
