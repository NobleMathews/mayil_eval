{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to the issue, suggesting the implementation of a feature toggle and syncing data with Intercom. However, it does not provide specific, actionable steps that align with the git diff. The git diff shows a simple addition of a property to an object being passed to a function, which is a direct and specific change. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests a broader set of actions without focusing on the actual code change needed. It also includes links to code snippets that may be related to the issue but does not directly address the change shown in the git diff. While the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant, it lacks the actionable content that closely matches the git diff, and therefore, it scores a 2.",
