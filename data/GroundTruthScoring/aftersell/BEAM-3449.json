    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 4 indicates that the RESPONSE offers some actionable advice and partially matches the git diff but is incomplete or partially relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests creating a new function `isRoktEnabled` and updating the `updateIntercomData` function to include a `rokt_ads_enabled` property, which aligns with the general idea of the git diff to surface Rokt ads enablement to Intercom. However, the git diff does not include the creation of a new function; instead, it directly adds the `rokt_ads_enabled` property to the `initIntercomScript` function using the existing `user.featureFlags.roktIntegrationIsEnabled` value. The RESPONSE does not match the git diff in terms of the specific implementation details, as it suggests a more complex approach involving an additional function that is not present in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead to confusion. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of surfacing Rokt ads enablement but lacks the precision and direct alignment with the git diff's approach.",
