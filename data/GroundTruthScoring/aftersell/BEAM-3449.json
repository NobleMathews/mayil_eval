    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and addresses the specific issue described. A score of 2 indicates that the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content or does not closely match the git diff.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to handling the enablement of Rokt ads within Intercom, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, it lacks specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows a simple addition of a property to an object that is being passed to a function, while the RESPONSE suggests implementing checks, using Typegoose to interact with MongoDB, and integrating with the Intercom API, which is a more complex and broader approach than what is required by the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that might be related to the issue, but it does not provide clear instructions on what changes need to be made to those snippets. The RESPONSE does not directly address the simple addition of the 'rokt_ads_enabled' property to the object in the 'initIntercomScript' function, which is the actual change needed to resolve the issue as shown in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it discusses the feature flag and user interaction with Rokt ads, which is related to the issue. However, it does not provide the specific, actionable guidance needed to implement the solution as per the git diff, and therefore, it does not closely match the git diff.",
