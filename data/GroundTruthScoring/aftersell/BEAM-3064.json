    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue of making the selected configuration darker, which is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE. However, it lacks specific actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff shows that the solution involves modifying the styles.module.scss file to change the background color of the selected item. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests looking into various files and snippets that may not be directly related to the issue at hand, such as the branding-color-palette.tsx and multi-product-widget-settings.tsx files. It also incorrectly suggests updating theme settings or inline styles, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE does not provide the precise guidance needed to directly address the issue as shown in the git diff, which is to update the CSS class for the selected item in the styles.module.scss file. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only somewhat relevant and does not offer actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
