    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to make the selected configuration background darker, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff indicates that the change was made in a SCSS file, specifically targeting a class related to the navigation item's selected state. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, incorrectly directs the developer to look into React component files and provides a list of code snippets that are not directly related to the issue at hand. While the RESPONSE does mention modifying a CSS or SCSS file, it does not identify the correct file or class to be modified as shown in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes unnecessary steps and references to unrelated code snippets, which could lead the developer away from the correct solution. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
