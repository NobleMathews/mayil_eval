    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a general approach to changing the background color of selected configurations, which is relevant to the ISSUE of making the selected configuration darker. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff specifically modifies the styles for a '.container' class in a SCSS file, targeting a class related to the 'Polaris-Navigation__Item--selected' and changing the background color to a variable '--p-color-bg-primary-subdued'.\n\nThe RESPONSE, on the other hand, suggests identifying components and modifying their styles using either CSS-in-JS or SASS/LESS, which is a different approach from what is shown in the git diff. It also provides examples of how to implement the changes in React components and theme settings, which are not directly related to the changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly relevant to the changes made in the git diff.\n\nWhile the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the issue of changing the background color for better visibility, it does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. The RESPONSE does not mention the specific SCSS file or the exact class that needs to be modified as per the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that aligns with the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
