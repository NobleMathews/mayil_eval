    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to solving the issue of making the selected configuration more visually prominent, which is aligned with the goal of the ISSUE. However, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It suggests modifying the CSS class in a `styles.css` file and updating React components, which is somewhat relevant but not specific enough to the changes shown in the git diff. The git diff specifically modifies the `.container` class in `styles.module.scss` and changes the background color of the `[class~='Polaris-Navigation__Item--selected']` selector. The RESPONSE fails to mention the exact file and class that needs to be modified according to the git diff.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a list of code snippets to check, which are not directly related to the git diff or the specific issue of making the selected configuration darker. These snippets seem to be more about theme settings and color management in general, rather than the specific change required. The RESPONSE does not provide a clear, actionable solution that would enable the developer to fix the issue effortlessly, and it does not align closely with the git diff provided.",
