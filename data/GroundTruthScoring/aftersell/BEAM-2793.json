    "score": 1,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to it.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically addresses an issue in the 'getImageProps.ts' file related to the handling of image properties for products. The RESPONSE, on the other hand, focuses on troubleshooting the upsell functionality, which is not related to the git diff's changes. While the RESPONSE does provide a general approach to troubleshooting upsell issues, it does not offer any actionable guidance that would help resolve the specific issue presented in the git diff. The RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff, further indicating a misalignment. Therefore, the RESPONSE is not helpful in assisting the developer to fix the issue as described in the git diff. The score of 1 is given because the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the broader context of the ISSUE but fails to provide actionable content aligned with the git diff.",
