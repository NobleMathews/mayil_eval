    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests updating the rendering logic within the `PreviewCarousel` component to handle cases where upsell items do not have valid images. This approach is somewhat relevant to the issue described, as it addresses the problem of upsell items not being displayed due to image issues. However, the RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided, which specifically modifies the `getImageProps` utility function to handle null values in the `product.images` and `product.media` arrays. The RESPONSE's suggestion to use a default placeholder image in the `PreviewCarousel` component is a different approach and does not directly address the null value handling in the `getImageProps` function. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not provide any actionable guidance on how to implement the null-checking logic in the `getImageProps` function, which is the core of the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff.",
