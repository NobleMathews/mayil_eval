{
    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests implementing a conditional check in the `PreviewCarousel` component and modifying the image source attribute to handle null or undefined image properties. While this is somewhat relevant to the issue of handling null image properties, it does not align with the git diff's approach, which specifically modifies the `getImageProps` utility function to handle null values in the `product.images` and `product.media` arrays. The RESPONSE does not mention modifying the `getImageProps` function or the exact lines of code that were changed in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a general approach and code snippets that are not directly related to the git diff's solution. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant because it addresses the broader issue of handling null image properties, but it lacks actionable content that aligns closely with the git diff, thus warranting a score of 2.",
