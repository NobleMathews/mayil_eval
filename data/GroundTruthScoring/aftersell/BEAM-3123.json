    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE acknowledges the need for consistent capitalization in titles but fails to provide specific, actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The RESPONSE suggests locating and updating hardcoded strings, modifying utility functions or localization files, and conducting a comprehensive search throughout the codebase. However, it does not provide clear instructions on how to make these changes, nor does it reference the specific files and lines of code that need to be updated as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a list of code snippets to check, but these are not directly related to the issue at hand and do not match the git diff provided. The RESPONSE does not address the specific changes made in the git diff, such as the exact text changes in the titles. Instead, it provides a general approach without actionable steps.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it recognizes the issue of capitalization consistency but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a low score.",
