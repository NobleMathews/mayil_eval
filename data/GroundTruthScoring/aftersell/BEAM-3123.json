    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES offering confidently incorrect solutions or advice not supported by the git diff should be scored as 0. RESPONSES that appear relevant but offer no real value or actionable insight in the context of the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff provided and fails to offer actionable guidance to resolve the issue. It suggests a broad and incorrect approach, such as updating constants and documentation files, which is not supported by the git diff. The git diff specifically shows changes in the capitalization of titles within the React component files, while the RESPONSE incorrectly advises on modifying constants, documentation, and HTML files, which are not part of the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets and does not provide any real value or actionable insight that would help the developer fix the issue of consistent capitalization in titles as described in the original issue and addressed in the git diff.",
