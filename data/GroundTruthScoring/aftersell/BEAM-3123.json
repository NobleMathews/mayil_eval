    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to fixing the issue of inconsistent capitalization in titles, which is relevant to the ISSUE described. It suggests identifying the locations in the codebase where the titles are defined and revising them to the appropriate capitalization. This aligns with the general goal of the git diff, which is to correct the capitalization of specific titles in the codebase.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not provide specific, actionable guidance that closely matches the git diff. It does not mention the exact files or lines of code that need to be changed, unlike the git diff which provides precise modifications to specific files. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a lengthy and unnecessary explanation of how to search for the titles and suggests reviewing code snippets that are not provided in the git diff or the issue description. This could potentially lead the developer to look in the wrong places or make unnecessary changes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes a list of links to various parts of a GitHub repository, which are not related to the git diff provided and could confuse the developer. These links do not add value to the RESPONSE in terms of addressing the issue at hand.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of capitalization but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
