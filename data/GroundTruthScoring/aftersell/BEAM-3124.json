    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should be evaluated based on how well it aligns with the git diff and the guidelines provided. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provided does not closely align with the git diff. It does mention some of the changes required, such as removing the checkbox beside \"Add a gift message?\" in the edit modal, updating the label for the text box placeholder, and changing the default values for the checkbox title and text box placeholder. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance on how to implement these changes in the codebase. It also includes irrelevant information, such as suggesting to locate and remove components that are not mentioned in the git diff, and it provides incorrect file paths and code snippets that do not exist in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the Banner component in the `checkout-editor-v2.page.tsx` file, nor does it mention the removal of the `checked` property from the `Note` object in the `checkout-v2.dtos.ts` file. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
