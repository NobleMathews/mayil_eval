    "score": 9,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides clear, actionable guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE accurately addresses the issue by suggesting the removal of the checkbox component, adding a new title above the text box, changing the label for the text box placeholder, and adjusting default values. These actions align with the git diff, which shows the removal of the 'checked' property from the Note object, the addition of a title above the text box, and updates to the placeholder text and labels.\n\nThe RESPONSE also suggests reviewing shared code in 'extensions-web-common/checkout/widgets/note.tsx' for consistency, which is a reasonable step to ensure that changes are applied throughout the application, although this specific file path is not mentioned in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE provides code snippets and file paths to check, which are helpful for locating the relevant sections of code. However, the provided file paths are not directly related to the git diff, and the RESPONSE includes a link to a non-existent 'extensions-web-common' directory, which is not part of the git diff. This minor discrepancy does not significantly detract from the overall value of the RESPONSE.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE offers a comprehensive and effective solution to the issue, closely matching the git diff's approach. It only slightly deviates from the git diff by mentioning a non-existent directory, but this does not affect the core solution to the issue.",
