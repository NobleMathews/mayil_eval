    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides some actionable advice that aligns with the git diff, such as removing the checkbox related to the active/inactive state of a note, updating the label for the text box placeholder, and changing the default values for the checkbox title and text box placeholder. However, the RESPONSE does not fully match the git diff in several ways:\n\n1. The RESPONSE suggests adding a new title element above the text box with the content \"Checkbox title\", which is correct according to the issue description. However, the git diff shows that the title added is \"Checkbox title\" with a variant of 'headingSm', not 'headingXs' as suggested in the RESPONSE.\n\n2. The RESPONSE does not mention the changes made to the banner title and action content in the git diff, which are part of the issue's context.\n\n3. The RESPONSE includes a link to a GitHub repository that does not exist in the git diff, which could potentially confuse the developer.\n\n4. The RESPONSE suggests using a `Text` component with a variant of 'headingXs', but the git diff uses a `Text` component with a variant of 'headingSm'.\n\n5. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made to the placeholder text in the git diff, which updates the placeholder from 'Write your note here!' to 'Write your note here...'.\n\n6. The RESPONSE does not mention the removal of the `checked` property from the `Note` object in the DTO file, which is a significant change in the git diff.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE provides some useful guidance but is incomplete and partially relevant, missing several key aspects of the git diff.",
