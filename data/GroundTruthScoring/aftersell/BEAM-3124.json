    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to addressing the issue, but it lacks specific actionable steps that align closely with the git diff. It correctly identifies the need to remove the \"Active\" vs \"Inactive\" state and update placeholder text, which is in line with the git diff. However, the RESPONSE does not mention the changes to the banner text in the `checkout-editor-v2.page.tsx` file, nor does it address the removal of the `checked` property from the `Note` object in the `checkout-v2.dtos.ts` file, which are key elements of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to remove the Checkbox component next to the \"Add a gift message?\" label, which is not reflected in the git diff. The RESPONSE also provides links to code snippets, but these are not directly related to the changes in the git diff and do not provide the necessary context or guidance to implement the required changes. Overall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks the actionable content and close alignment with the git diff necessary to score higher.",
