    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests reviewing the component responsible for plan selection and updating it to restrict non-checkout stores to the Basic plan. It also recommends implementing unit tests to validate the behavior. While these suggestions are somewhat relevant to the issue, they do not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the function name was changed to 'useAvailablePlanIdsForCheckoutEligibleUsers' and that the logic for accepting pricing plans was updated to use a specific plan ID or to use the updated hook directly. The RESPONSE does not mention renaming the hook or updating the logic to use a specific plan ID, which are key elements of the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides a code snippet and suggests unit tests, but these do not match the changes shown in the git diff. The RESPONSE is somewhat relevant as it addresses the issue of restricting plan selection for non-checkout stores, but it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 2.",
