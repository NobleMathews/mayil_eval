    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps to address the issue of incorrect pricing plan acceptance during onboarding for non-checkout stores. It includes updating various files and constants, adjusting billing logic, and conducting testing. However, the RESPONSE does not align closely with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates specific changes to function names and the use of certain constants within the application's codebase, while the RESPONSE focuses on a broader approach without specific reference to the changes shown in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does not mention renaming the 'useAvailablePlanIds' function to 'useAvailablePlanIdsForCheckoutEligibleUsers' or the removal of the 'availablePlanIds' prop from the 'AcceptWithCheckout' component, both of which are key changes in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests revising a 'billing.constants.ts' file and adjusting logic within a 'legacy-billing-v2.service.ts' file, neither of which are mentioned in the git diff, and it is unclear if these changes would be effective or relevant given the issue and the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to update pricing information to reflect the new structure and to ensure accurate display and billing. However, it lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff and does not provide clear guidance on implementing the specific changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, warranting a score of 2.",
