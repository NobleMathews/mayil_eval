    "criteria": "The RESPONSE must provide actionable, relevant guidance that closely aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests a series of steps and code snippets to review, which are not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff indicates that the issue was resolved by renaming a hook to 'useAvailablePlanIdsForCheckoutEligibleUsers' and updating the logic in various components to use this new hook or to directly use a new constant for the plan ID. The RESPONSE, however, focuses on revising files and logic that are not mentioned in the git diff, such as 'billing.constants.ts' and 'legacy-billing-v2.service.ts'. It also suggests implementing mechanisms and conducting comprehensive testing, which are general good practices but do not directly address the specific changes made in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a list of code snippets to check, which are not relevant to the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or achieves similar results, and it does not assist the developer in fixing the issue as described.",
