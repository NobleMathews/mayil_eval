    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES offering confidently incorrect solutions or advice not supported by the git diff should be scored as 0. Ensure alternative solutions are not penalized if they are effective and relevant.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying various files and components such as `billing.constants.ts`, `legacy-billing-v2.service.ts`, `CustomPricing.tsx`, and `useAcceptPricingPlan.ts` to address the issue of incorrect pricing plan acceptance in onboarding for non-checkout stores. However, the git diff provided does not indicate any changes to these files or components. Instead, the git diff shows renaming of a hook, updating function calls, and changing hardcoded plan IDs and pricing text in specific components. The RESPONSE does not align with the git diff's approach to resolving the issue and does not offer a viable alternative solution. It also includes a list of code snippets to check, which are not relevant to the git diff's changes. Therefore, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and offers confidently incorrect solutions not supported by the git diff.",
