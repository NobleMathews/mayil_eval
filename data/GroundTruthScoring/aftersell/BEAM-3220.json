    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not directly address the creation of the SlackConnection model as described in the ISSUE. It provides a general approach to enhancing the AfterSell application's functionality with a new model for managing Slack integrations, which is somewhat relevant to the issue. However, the RESPONSE fails to provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff. The git diff specifically shows the creation of a SlackConnection class with two properties, 'shop' and 'slackChannelId', and the removal of the 'hasSlackChannelSupport' property from another model. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or provide an alternative solution that would achieve the same result. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the SlackConnection model or the changes shown in the git diff, which could lead to confusion rather than helping the developer fix the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content and does not closely match the git diff, warranting a low score.",
