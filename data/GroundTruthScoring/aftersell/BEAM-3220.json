    "score": 4,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that offer some actionable advice and partially match the git diff but are incomplete or partially relevant should score between 4 and 6.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general outline of steps to implement the `SlackConnection` model, which is relevant to the ISSUE. It suggests defining the schema, developing API endpoints, writing a migration script, and setting up Zapier triggers and actions. These steps are in line with the broader context of the ISSUE, which involves creating a model and integrating it with other systems.\n\nHowever, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific changes shown in the GIT DIFF. The GIT DIFF includes the actual code for the `SlackConnection` model using Typegoose, which is a concrete implementation detail that the RESPONSE does not mention. Additionally, the GIT DIFF shows the removal of the `hasSlackChannelSupport` field from the `users.model.ts` file, which is not addressed in the RESPONSE at all.\n\nThe RESPONSE does provide links to code snippets, but these links seem to be placeholders and do not lead to actual code relevant to the `SlackConnection` model. This part of the RESPONSE does not add value to the developer looking to implement the solution.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the GIT DIFF. It provides a high-level overview of the steps needed but does not offer the specific guidance present in the GIT DIFF. Therefore, it scores a 4 as it is incomplete and only partially relevant.",
