    "score": 3,
    "criteria": "RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a general approach to implementing the SlackConnection model, which is relevant to the ISSUE. However, it lacks specific actionable steps that align with the git diff provided. The RESPONSE talks about designing the schema, integrating the model, creating a user interface in Retool, developing a migration script, configuring Zapier, and establishing a schedule for updates and communication. While these steps are related to the overall task described in the ISSUE, they do not directly address the creation of the SlackConnection model as shown in the git diff.\n\nThe git diff specifically shows the addition of a new SlackConnection class with two properties, `shop` and `slackChannelId`, and the removal of the `hasSlackChannelSupport` property from the users model. The RESPONSE does not mention these specific changes or the removal of the property from the users model. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes links to code snippets that are not directly related to the changes in the git diff, which could lead to confusion.\n\nOverall, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant to the ISSUE but does not provide the actionable content needed to directly address the changes shown in the git diff. Therefore, it receives a score of 3.",
