    "score": 2,
    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE does not align well with the git diff provided. The git diff shows the creation of a `SlackConnection` model in TypeScript using Typegoose with specific fields `shop` and `slackChannelId`, along with a regex pattern for validation. The RESPONSE, however, suggests creating a `SlackConnection` model with different fields such as `merchant_id`, `slack_workspace`, `enabled`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. This does not match the fields defined in the git diff, nor does it provide a valid alternative approach to the issue described.\n\nAdditionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to create a database migration and configure Zapier, which is not part of the git diff or the issue description. While these suggestions may be relevant to the overall project, they do not address the specific task of creating the `SlackConnection` model as outlined in the git diff.\n\nThe RESPONSE does correctly identify the need to define the `SlackConnection` model using Typegoose, which is a point of alignment with the git diff. However, the fields and implementation details provided are incorrect and do not offer a viable alternative to the git diff. Therefore, the RESPONSE is somewhat relevant but lacks actionable content that closely matches the git diff, resulting in a low score.",
