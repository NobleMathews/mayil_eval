    "score": 0,
    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of preventing text wrapping in tables. The RESPONSE should be relevant to the issue and the git diff, and it should not provide incorrect solutions or irrelevant information.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests applying CSS rules to prevent text wrapping in table cells, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in React components, adding keys to elements in a list, modifying inline styles, and adding a new CSS class for flex alignment. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide a viable alternative solution. Instead, it focuses on CSS properties for text wrapping, which is not the approach taken in the git diff. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant links to code snippets that are not part of the git diff or the issue at hand. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not offer any actionable guidance or meaningful information that would assist the developer in resolving the issue as per the git diff.",
