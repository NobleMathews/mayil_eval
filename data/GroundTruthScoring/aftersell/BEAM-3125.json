    "criteria": "The RESPONSE should provide actionable guidance that aligns with the git diff or offers a viable alternative to address the issue of preventing wrapping in tables, specifically for testimonials and trigger conditions in a web application.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests applying CSS styling to prevent text wrapping, which is not aligned with the git diff. The git diff shows changes to React components, adding keys to elements in a list, updating inline styles, and modifying class names to prevent wrapping and improve layout. The RESPONSE does not address these changes or provide a similar solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippets and links to unrelated parts of the codebase, which do not contribute to solving the issue. The RESPONSE fails to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative solution.",
