    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0. RESPONSES that are somewhat relevant but lack actionable content or do not closely match the git diff should receive scores between 1 and 3.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests using CSS properties to prevent text wrapping in the testimonials section, which is not aligned with the git diff provided. The git diff shows changes in the React components and SCSS files to adjust the layout and add keys to elements, which is the actual solution to the issue. The RESPONSE does not address the changes made in the git diff, such as adding keys to React elements or modifying the layout with flexbox. Instead, it focuses on CSS properties that are not part of the git diff solution. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes irrelevant code snippets and GitHub links that do not contribute to solving the issue. Therefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and fails to address the specific issue described.",
