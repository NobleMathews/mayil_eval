    "criteria": "The evaluation should take into account how well the RESPONSE addresses the specific issue described and aligns with or offers a viable alternative to the git diff. An effective alternative approach that achieves the same result as the git diff, without directly matching it, should not be penalized. RESPONSES that fail to provide any actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff should receive a score of 0.",
    "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE suggests modifying the CSS `white-space` property for the `.testimonial` class to prevent text wrapping. However, the git diff provided does not include any changes related to the `.testimonial` class or the `white-space` property. Instead, the git diff shows changes to React component files, adding keys to elements in a list, creating a new CSS class `.flexAlignCenter`, and restructuring the layout of elements using inline styles and CSS classes.\n\nThe RESPONSE also includes links to code snippets that are not relevant to the git diff or the issue described. The RESPONSE does not address the actual changes made in the git diff, such as adding keys to list items to prevent React key warnings, or the restructuring of elements to prevent text wrapping in tables.\n\nTherefore, the RESPONSE does not provide actionable or meaningful guidance aligned with the git diff and does not offer a viable alternative to the changes required to fix the issue. It fails to address the specific issue of preventing text wrapping in tables and instead focuses on an unrelated CSS property that is not part of the solution.",
