    "title": "LassoCV always sets precompute to False before fitting the chosen alpha value",
    "body": "I'm using a very large data-set. After fitting 100 x 3-fold cross-validated LASSOs at lightning speed (a few seconds total), LassoCV stalls at the final hurdle: fitting a LASSO with the chosen alpha value to the whole data-set (waiting over half an hour - it should only take approximately 50% longer than a single fold...). After a lot of head-scratching I found the reason why. In coordinate_descent.py's LinearModelCV.fit() just before calling the final model.fit() (line 1223 in Python2.7/sklearn0.19.0), there is the rather inconspicuous line\r\n\r\n`model.precompute = False`\r\n\r\nSo even if you've specified precompute as True when calling LassoCV, it is ignored. Why is this? It's making the computation impractically slow (should it even be this slow without precompute?) - literally just commenting the line out makes the fit instantaneous. Am I missing something here mathematically - I can't see anything wrong with using a precomputed Gram matrix for the final fit when it was used for all of the cross-validation fits? The implementation seems to imply it should be used for performance whenever num_samples > num_features. Why hard set it to False?\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue is that `LassoCV` is not using `precompute=True` for the final fit even if specified by the user. The expected behavior is that if a user sets `precompute=True`, it should be used during cross-validation and the final model fitting in `LassoCV`. The issue occurs in the `coordinate_descent.py` file, specifically in the `LinearModelCV.fit()` method.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n\n- Locate the `fit` method in the `LassoCV` class within the `coordinate_descent.py` file.\n- Ensure that the `precompute` parameter is correctly set based on the user's input before the final `model.fit()` call.\n- If the `precompute` parameter is being overwritten or ignored, modify the code to respect the user's input.\n\nThe code change might look something like this:\n\n```python\nclass LassoCV(LinearModelCV):\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        # ... [code before final fit] ...\n        \n        # Ensure precompute is set according to the user's input\n        self.precompute = user_defined_precompute_value  # user_defined_precompute_value should be the value passed by the user\n        \n        # Final model fitting with the correct precompute value\n        model.fit(X, y)\n        \n        # ... [rest of the code] ...\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `user_defined_precompute_value` with the actual variable or attribute that holds the user's input for the `precompute` parameter.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [linear_model](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/linear_model)- [Lines 835 - 904](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/linear_model/_base.py#L835-L904)\n\n This snippet from '_base.py' contains logic for preprocessing data in linear models with L1 or L0 penalty, including handling of the 'precompute' parameter which is central to the issue.",

As a result, it\n# is very efficient when there are only of few kinks, which is the case if\n# there are few features or samples. Also, it is able to compute the full path\n# without setting any hyperparameter. On the opposite, coordinate descent\n# computes the path points on a pre-specified grid (here we use the default).\n# Thus it is more efficient if the number of grid points is smaller than the\n# number of kinks in the path. Such a strategy can be interesting if the number\n# of features is really large and there are enough samples to be selected in\n# each of the cross-validation fold. In terms of numerical errors, for heavily\n# correlated variables, Lars will accumulate more errors, while the coordinate\n# descent algorithm will only sample the path on a grid.\n#\n# Note how the optimal value of alpha varies for each fold. This illustrates\n# why nested-cross validation is a good strategy when trying to evaluate the\n# performance of a method for which a parameter is chosen by cross-validation:\n# this choice of parameter may not be optimal for a final evaluation on\n# unseen test set only.\n#\n# Conclusion\n# ----------\n# In this tutorial, we presented two approaches for selecting the best\n# hyperparameter `alpha`: one strategy finds the optimal value of `alpha`\n# by only using the training set and some information criterion, and another\n# strategy is based on cross-validation.\n#\n# In this example, both approaches are working similarly. The in-sample\n# hyperparameter selection even shows its efficacy in terms of computational\n# performance. However, it can only be used when the number of samples is large\n# enough compared to the number of features.\n#\n# That's why hyperparameter optimization via cross-validation is a safe\n# strategy: it works in different settings.",
