    "title": "Incorrect documentation for `warm_start` behavior on BaseForest-derived classes",
    "body": "#### Describe the issue linked to the documentation\r\n\r\nThe [RandomForestRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) documentation states:\r\n\r\n\r\n> When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole new forest.\r\n\r\nThis is also true for all classes that derive from `BaseForest`, such as `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomTreesEmbedding`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the [source code](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/ensemble/forest.py#L297) does not reflect this behavior. When `n_more_estimators == 0`, it does not fit a new forest and instead just recomputes the OOB score if applicable.\r\n\r\n#### Suggest a potential alternative/fix\r\n\r\nThere are two potential fixes:\r\n\r\n1. Reword the documentation to state:\r\n\r\n > When set to True, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, reuse the existing ensemble.\r\n\r\n2. Modify the actual behavior of this method to fit a new forest in the case where `n_more_estimators == 0` to reflect the existing documentation.\r\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude10.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The issue is related to the `warm_start` behavior in `RandomForestRegressor` and other `BaseForest` derived classes.\n- When `warm_start=True` and `n_more_estimators` is set to 0, the code should not fit new trees but instead should recompute the OOB score if applicable.\n- The relevant code snippet is from `sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py` (Lines: 427 to 477).\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n- Check if `self.oob_score` is `True` after the warning for `n_more_estimators == 0` and before returning `self`.\n- If `self.oob_score` is `True`, recompute the OOB score using the existing trees.\n- The recomputation of the OOB score can be done by calling a method similar to `_set_oob_score_and_attributes` if it exists, or by implementing the OOB score computation logic if such a method does not exist.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```python\nelif n_more_estimators == 0:\n    warn(\n        \"Warm-start fitting without increasing n_estimators does not \"\n        \"fit new trees.\"\n    )\n    if self.oob_score:\n        # Recompute the OOB score using existing trees\n        self._set_oob_score_and_attributes(X, y)\n    return self\n```\n\nMake sure to place this logic in the `fit` method of the `BaseForest` class or the appropriate derived class where the `n_more_estimators == 0` condition is checked. The method `_set_oob_score_and_attributes` should be the one responsible for recomputing the OOB score, and it should be called with the correct arguments (`X` and `y`), which are the training data and target values. If the method does not exist, implement the logic to compute the OOB score based on the existing trees and set the `oob_score_` attribute accordingly.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/tree//sklearn/ensemble)- [Lines 427 - 477](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py#L427-L477)\n\n This snippet contains the actual implementation of the warm_start behavior in RandomForestRegressor, which is directly related to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 2906](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py#L1-L2906)\n\n This snippet contains the documentation for RandomForestRegressor that is reported to be incorrect and needs to be updated to reflect the actual behavior or the code needs to be changed to match the documentation. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 91](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py#L1-L91)\n\n This snippet provides an overview of the BaseForest class and its behavior, which is relevant for understanding the context of the warm_start parameter across all derived classes.",

In\n    each stage ``n_classes_`` regression trees are fit on the negative gradient\n    of the loss function, e.g. binary or multiclass log loss. Binary\n    classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is\n    induced.\n\n    :class:`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is a much faster\n    variant of this algorithm for intermediate datasets (`n_samples >= 10_000`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    loss : {'log_loss', 'exponential'}, default='log_loss'\n        The loss function to be optimized. 'log_loss' refers to binomial and\n        multinomial deviance, the same as used in logistic regression.\n        It is a good choice for classification with probabilistic outputs.\n        For loss 'exponential', gradient boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.\n\n    learning_rate : float, default=0.1\n        Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.\n        There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.\n        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.\n\n    n_estimators : int, default=100\n        The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting\n        is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually\n        results in better performance.\n        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.\n\n    subsample : float, default=1.0\n        The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base\n        learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient\n        Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.\n        Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance\n        and an increase in bias.\n        Values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`.\n\n    criterion : {'friedman_mse', 'squared_error'}, default='friedman_mse'\n        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are\n        'friedman_mse' for the mean squared error with improvement score by\n        Friedman, 'squared_error' for mean squared error.

The *out-of-bag* (OOB) error is the average error for\neach :math:`z_i` calculated using predictions from the trees that do not\ncontain :math:`z_i` in their respective bootstrap sample. This allows the\n``RandomForestClassifier`` to be fit and validated whilst being trained [1]_.\n\nThe example below demonstrates how the OOB error can be measured at the\naddition of each new tree during training. The resulting plot allows a\npractitioner to approximate a suitable value of ``n_estimators`` at which the\nerror stabilizes.\n\n.. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J.

To\n    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be\n    controlled by setting those parameter values.\n\n    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,\n    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,\n    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement\n    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the\n    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during\n    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.\n\n    The default value ``max_features=1.0`` uses ``n_features``\n    rather than ``n_features / 3``. The latter was originally suggested in\n    [1], whereas the former was more recently justified empirically in [2].\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    .. [1] L.
