                "code": "\"\"\"\n    Base class for applied mathematical functions.\n\n    It also serves as a constructor for undefined function classes.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    First example shows how to use Function as a constructor for undefined\n    function classes:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Function, Symbol\n    >>> x = Symbol('x')\n    >>> f = Function('f')\n    >>> g = Function('g')(x)\n    >>> f\n    f\n    >>> f(x)\n    f(x)\n    >>> g\n    g(x)\n    >>> f(x).diff(x)\n    Derivative(f(x), x)\n    >>> g.diff(x)\n    Derivative(g(x), x)\n\n    Assumptions can be passed to Function, and if function is initialized with a\n    Symbol, the function inherits the name and assumptions associated with the Symbol:\n\n    >>> f_real = Function('f', real=True)\n    >>> f_real(x).is_real\n    True\n    >>> f_real_inherit = Function(Symbol('f', real=True))\n    >>> f_real_inherit(x).is_real\n    True\n\n    Note that assumptions on a function are unrelated to the assumptions on\n    the variable it is called on. If you want to add a relationship, subclass\n    Function and define the appropriate ``_eval_is_assumption`` methods.\n\n    In the following example Function is used as a base class for\n    ``my_func`` that represents a mathematical function *my_func*. Suppose\n    that it is well known, that *my_func(0)* is *1* and *my_func* at infinity\n    goes to *0*, so we want those two simplifications to occur automatically.\n    Suppose also that *my_func(x)* is real exactly when *x* is real. Here is\n    an implementation that honours those requirements:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Function, S, oo, I, sin\n    >>> class my_func(Function):\n    ...\n    ...     @classmethod\n    ...     def eval(cls, x):\n    ...         if x.is_Number:\n    ...             if x.is_zero:\n    ...                 return S.One\n    ...             elif x is S.Infinity:\n    ...                 return S.Zero\n    ...\n    ...     def _eval_is_real(self):\n    ...         return self.args[0].is_real\n    ...\n    >>> x = S('x')\n    >>> my_func(0) + sin(0)\n    1\n    >>> my_func(oo)\n    0\n    >>> my_func(3.54).n() # Not yet implemented for my_func.\n    my_func(3.54)\n    >>> my_func(I).is_real\n    False\n\n    In order for ``my_func`` to become useful, several other methods would\n    need to be implemented. See source code of some of the already\n    implemented functions for more complete examples.\n\n    Also, if the function can take more than one argument, then ``nargs``\n    must be defined, e.g. if ``my_func`` can take one or two arguments\n    then,\n\n    >>> class my_func(Function):\n    ...     nargs = (1, 2)\n    ...\n    >>>\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @property\n    def _diff_wrt(self):\n        return False",

If you want to add a relationship, subclass\n    Function and define the appropriate ``_eval_is_assumption`` methods.\n\n    In the following example Function is used as a base class for\n    ``my_func`` that represents a mathematical function *my_func*. Suppose\n    that it is well known, that *my_func(0)* is *1* and *my_func* at infinity\n    goes to *0*, so we want those two simplifications to occur automatically.\n    Suppose also that *my_func(x)* is real exactly when *x* is real. Here is\n    an implementation that honours those requirements:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Function, S, oo, I, sin\n    >>> class my_func(Function):\n    ...\n    ...     @classmethod\n    ...     def eval(cls, x):\n    ...         if x.is_Number:\n    ...             if x.is_zero:\n    ...                 return S.One\n    ...             elif x is S.Infinity:\n    ...                 return S.Zero\n    ...\n    ...     def _eval_is_real(self):\n    ...         return self.args[0].is_real\n    ...\n    >>> x = S('x')\n    >>> my_func(0) + sin(0)\n    1\n    >>> my_func(oo)\n    0\n    >>> my_func(3.54).n() # Not yet implemented for my_func.\n    my_func(3.54)\n    >>> my_func(I).is_real\n    False\n\n    In order for ``my_func`` to become useful, several other methods would\n    need to be implemented. See source code of some of the already\n    implemented functions for more complete examples.\n\n    Also, if the function can take more than one argument, then ``nargs``\n    must be defined, e.g. if ``my_func`` can take one or two arguments\n    then,\n\n    >>> class my_func(Function):\n    ...     nargs = (1, 2)\n    ...\n    >>>\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    @property\n    def _diff_wrt(self):\n        return False",

True is returned if the\nobject has the property and False is returned if it doesn't or can't\n(i.e. doesn't make sense):\n\n    >>> from sympy import I\n    >>> I.is_algebraic\n    True\n    >>> I.is_real\n    False\n    >>> I.is_prime\n    False\n\nWhen the property cannot be determined (or when a method is not\nimplemented) None will be returned, e.g. a generic symbol, x, may or\nmay not be positive so a value of None is returned for x.is_positive.\n\nBy default, all symbolic values are in the largest set in the given context\nwithout specifying the property. For example, a symbol that has a property\nbeing integer, is also real, complex, etc.\n\nHere follows a list of possible assumption names:\n\n.. glossary::\n\n    commutative\n        object commutes with any other object with\n        respect to multiplication operation.\n\n    complex\n        object can have only values from the set\n        of complex numbers.\n\n    imaginary\n        object value is a number that can be written as a real\n        number multiplied by the imaginary unit ``I``.

The ``assumptions0`` attribute gives the full set of\nassumptions derived from a given set of initial assumptions. The\nlatter assumptions are stored as ``Symbol._assumptions.generator``\n\n    >>> Symbol('x', prime=True, even=True)._assumptions.generator\n    {'even': True, 'prime': True}\n\nThe ``generator`` is not necessarily canonical nor is it filtered\nin any way: it records the assumptions used to instantiate a Symbol\nand (for storage purposes) represents a more compact representation\nof the assumptions needed to recreate the full set in\n`Symbol.assumptions0`.\n\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n..
