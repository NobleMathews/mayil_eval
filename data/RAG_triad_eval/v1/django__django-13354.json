    "mayil_response": "- Review the `MigrationOptimizer` logic in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` to ensure that it correctly handles the order of operations based on model dependencies, especially when dealing with model inheritance.\n- Modify the `_sort_migrations` method in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` to ensure that `BaseModel` creation operations are ordered before `SubModel` creation operations.\n- Ensure that the `MigrationOptimizer` is not case-sensitive when dealing with app names, as this could be the cause of the `InvalidBasesError` when the app name contains uppercase letters.\n- Add a unit test to cover the scenario where an app with uppercase letters in its name goes through the migration process to ensure that the issue is resolved and does not reoccur.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 381 - 1683](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L381-L1683)\n\n This snippet contains the _sort_migrations method which reorders operations within the same app. The issue is related to the incorrect order of operations when app names contain uppercase letters, so this method is likely involved in the bug. \n\n\n   - [Lines 480 - 510](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L480-L510)\n\n This snippet includes the add_operation method which is responsible for adding operations to the migration with dependencies.
