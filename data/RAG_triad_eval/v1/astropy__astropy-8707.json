    "body": "According to [the docs](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/_modules/astropy/io/fits/header.html#Header.fromstring), the method `Header.fromstring` \"...creates an HDU header from a byte string containing the entire header data.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"byte string\" here it really means the `str` type which on Python 2 could be raw binary data, but on Python 3 explicitly is not.   In fact it does work on Python 3's unicode `str`s, but here it assumes that the data can be ASCII-encoded.\r\n\r\nIts counterpart, `Header.fromfile` will work with files opened in text or binary mode.  So probably the simplest solution for now (as opposed to adding new methods or something like that) is to change `Header.fromstring` to accept unicode or bytes string types.\r\n\r\n`Card.fromstring` likely needs a similar treatment.\n",

It suggests updating the 'Header.fromstring' and 'Card.fromstring' methods to handle byte strings correctly by checking the type of the input and decoding it if it's a byte string. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the 'ascii' codec should be used for decoding, which is appropriate given that FITS headers should contain ASCII characters only. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets that demonstrate how to implement the proposed changes, which is highly valuable for resolving the issue. The RESPONSE also suggests ensuring the file opening mode in 'Header.fromfile' is correct based on the 'sep' parameter and adding tests to verify the changes, which are both relevant and important steps for a comprehensive solution. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not address the potential need to modify the '_from_blocks' method mentioned in the PROMPT, which may also need to be updated to handle bytes correctly in Python 3.",
