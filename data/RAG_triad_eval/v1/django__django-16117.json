    "title": "Generated migration file is not detected by django because of the name of newly generated migration file",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nAfter a new project is created we run:\npython manage.py migrate to sync with our auth database models.\nLets create an app called myapp, register this app on settings. Now we create a model inside myapp as:\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\tage = models.IntegerField()\nLets run makemigrations and migrate command for the app. This will generate a migration file with name 0001_initial.py inside myapp/migrations/ folder.\nNow let us create a constraints for the model as:\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n\tname = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\tage = models.IntegerField()\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tconstraints = [\n\t\t\tmodels.CheckConstraint(\n\t\t\t\tcheck=models.Q(age__gte=1),\n\t\t\t\tname=\"Age should not be.less.than.one.\"\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t]\nWhen we added CheckConstraint for our previous model, we need to run makemigrations and migrate to reflect the new changes on database.\nRunning makemigrations will generate a migration file inside user/migrations/ with name 0002_mymodel_age should not be.less.than.one..py. When we try to run migrate, django will not be able to detect this file and NO changes will be applied to existing database. If we run makemigrations again, the same file will be generated again. No matter how many time we run makemigrations, the same file will be generated again and again. The newly generated migration file is not detected by django migrate and showmigrations command. This is because of the name of migration file. The new migration file name contains serveral dots and because of this name, migrate/showmigration is not able to find the file.\nThere are mutiple solutions for this:\nFirst: Renaming the generated migration file. Remove . (dot) (excluding the .py)from the newly generated migration file. This will make sure that the file is recognized as python file by django migrate/showmigrations command.\nSecond: We can change the name of our constraint name inside the migration as : \nclass Meta:\n\t\tconstraints = [\n\t\t\tmodels.CheckConstraint(\n\t\t\t\tcheck=models.Q(age__gte=1),\n\t\t\t\tname=\"Age should not be less than one\"\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t]\nThe only difference between the constraint that was above and the constraint that is implemented now is in the value of name parameter for models.Q(). We removed the exisiting \"dot\" . from the name. Running makemigration will generate a migration file with name 0002_mymodel_age should not be less than one.py. Now running the migrate/showmigrations command will find the new migration file. This example is also commited in the repository\u200bhttps://github.com/bisalgt/test-django-migrations. One can look at the commit history and checkout to proper stage as needed , described by commit message on the repository commit history.\nThird: I have replaced the name of the migration file in django source code so that .(dot) gets replaced by some character_. I am also attaching the associated pull request \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/16080.\nUsing third approach makes sure that no one has to go through the step First and Second as described above. The solution would work out of the box.\n",
