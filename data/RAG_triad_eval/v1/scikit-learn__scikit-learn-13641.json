By default, it is\n        'strict', meaning that a UnicodeDecodeError will be raised. Other\n        values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.\n\n    strip_accents : {'ascii', 'unicode'} or callable, default=None\n        Remove accents and perform other character normalization\n        during the preprocessing step.\n        'ascii' is a fast method that only works on characters that have\n        a direct ASCII mapping.\n        'unicode' is a slightly slower method that works on any characters.\n        None (default) means no character normalization is performed.\n\n        Both 'ascii' and 'unicode' use NFKD normalization from\n        :func:`unicodedata.normalize`.\n\n    lowercase : bool, default=True\n        Convert all characters to lowercase before tokenizing.\n\n    preprocessor : callable, default=None\n        Override the preprocessing (string transformation) stage while\n        preserving the tokenizing and n-grams generation steps.\n        Only applies if ``analyzer`` is not callable.\n\n    tokenizer : callable, default=None\n        Override the string tokenization step while preserving the\n        preprocessing and n-grams generation steps.\n        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.\n\n    analyzer : {'word', 'char', 'char_wb'} or callable, default='word'\n        Whether the feature should be made of word or character n-grams.\n        Option 'char_wb' creates character n-grams only from text inside\n        word boundaries; n-grams at the edges of words are padded with space.\n\n        If a callable is passed it is used to extract the sequence of features\n        out of the raw, unprocessed input.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.21\n            Since v0.21, if ``input`` is ``'filename'`` or ``'file'``, the data\n            is first read from the file and then passed to the given callable\n            analyzer.\n\n    stop_words : {'english'}, list, default=None\n        If a string, it is passed to _check_stop_list and the appropriate stop\n        list is returned. 'english' is currently the only supported string\n        value.\n        There are several known issues with 'english' and you should\n        consider an alternative (see :ref:`stop_words`).\n\n        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which\n        will be removed from the resulting tokens.\n        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.\n\n        If None, no stop words will be used. In this case, setting `max_df`\n        to a higher value, such as in the range (0.7, 1.0), can automatically detect\n        and filter stop words based on intra corpus document frequency of terms.\n\n    token_pattern : str, default=r\"(?u)\\\\b\\\\w\\\\w+\\\\b\"\n        Regular expression denoting what constitutes a \"token\", only used\n        if ``analyzer == 'word'``. The default regexp selects tokens of 2\n        or more alphanumeric characters (punctuation is completely ignored\n        and always treated as a token separator).\n\n        If there is a capturing group in token_pattern then the\n        captured group content, not the entire match, becomes the token.\n        At most one capturing group is permitted.\n\n    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n), default=(1, 1)\n        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different\n        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n\n        will be used. For example an ``ngram_range`` of ``(1, 1)`` means only\n        unigrams, ``(1, 2)`` means unigrams and bigrams, and ``(2, 2)`` means\n        only bigrams.\n        Only applies if ``analyzer`` is not callable.\n\n    max_df : float or int, default=1.0\n        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document\n        frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific\n        stop words).\n        If float in range [0.0, 1.0], the parameter represents a proportion of\n        documents, integer absolute counts.\n        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.\n\n    min_df : float or int, default=1\n        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document\n        frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also\n        called cut-off in the literature.\n        If float in range of [0.0, 1.0], the parameter represents a proportion\n        of documents, integer absolute counts.\n        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.\n\n    max_features : int, default=None\n        If not None, build a vocabulary that only consider the top\n        `max_features` ordered by term frequency across the corpus.\n        Otherwise, all features are used.\n\n        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.\n\n    vocabulary : Mapping or iterable, default=None\n        Either a Mapping (e.g., a dict) where keys are terms and values are\n        indices in the feature matrix, or an iterable over terms. If not\n        given, a vocabulary is determined from the input documents.\n\n    binary : bool, default=False\n        If True, all non-zero term counts are set to 1. This does not mean\n        outputs will have only 0/1 values, only that the tf term in tf-idf\n        is binary. (Set `binary` to True, `use_idf` to False and\n        `norm` to None to get 0/1 outputs).\n\n    dtype : dtype, default=float64\n        Type of the matrix returned by fit_transform() or transform().\n\n    norm : {'l1', 'l2'} or None, default='l2'\n        Each output row will have unit norm, either:\n\n        - 'l2': Sum of squares of vector elements is 1. The cosine\n          similarity between two vectors is their dot product when l2 norm has\n          been applied.\n        - 'l1': Sum of absolute values of vector elements is 1.\n          See :func:`~sklearn.preprocessing.normalize`.\n        - None: No normalization.\n\n    use_idf : bool, default=True\n        Enable inverse-document-frequency reweighting. If False, idf(t) = 1.\n\n    smooth_idf : bool, default=True\n        Smooth idf weights by adding one to document frequencies, as if an\n        extra document was seen containing every term in the collection\n        exactly once. Prevents zero divisions.\n\n    sublinear_tf : bool, default=False\n        Apply sublinear tf scaling, i.e. replace tf with 1 + log(tf).\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    vocabulary_ : dict\n        A mapping of terms to feature indices.\n\n    fixed_vocabulary_ : bool\n        True if a fixed vocabulary of term to indices mapping\n        is provided by the user.\n\n    idf_ : array of shape (n_features,)\n        The inverse document frequency (IDF) vector; only defined\n        if ``use_idf`` is True.\n\n    stop_words_ : set\n        Terms that were ignored because they either:\n\n          - occurred in too many documents (`max_df`)\n          - occurred in too few documents (`min_df`)\n          - were cut off by feature selection (`max_features`).\n\n        This is only available if no vocabulary was given.\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    CountVectorizer : Transforms text into a sparse matrix of n-gram counts.\n\n    TfidfTransformer : Performs the TF-IDF transformation from a provided\n        matrix of counts.\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The ``stop_words_`` attribute can get large and increase the model size\n    when pickling.
