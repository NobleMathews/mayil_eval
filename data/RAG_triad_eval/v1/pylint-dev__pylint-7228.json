    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude10.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The issue is caused by the use of `\\p{Han}` in the regular expression pattern within the `.pylintrc` configuration file, which is not recognized by Python's `re` module.\n- To fix the issue, use the `regex` module instead of `re`, as it supports Unicode property escapes such as `\\p{Han}`.\n- Install the `regex` module if it's not already installed: `pip install regex`.\n- Replace the `re.compile` call with `regex.compile` in the relevant part of the Pylint codebase where the `function-rgx` configuration is processed.\n- Ensure that the `regex` module is imported at the beginning of the file where the change is made:\n  ```python\n  import regex as re\n  ```\n- Update the `.pylintrc` configuration file to indicate that the `regex` module should be used for the `function-rgx` pattern if such an option exists. If not, this should be handled internally by Pylint after making the above changes.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint/checkers)- [Lines 1 - 79](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/blob//pylint/checkers/unicode.py#L1-L79)\n\n This file contains logic related to Unicode checks in pylint, which may be relevant to the issue with the '\\p{Han}' regex pattern.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint) \u2192 [utils](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint/utils)- [Lines 1 - 78](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/blob//pylint/utils/pragma_parser.py#L1-L78)\n\n This file contains regex patterns and parsing logic for pylint pragmas, which could be relevant to the issue if the '\\p{Han}' pattern is being parsed incorrectly.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint/checkers)- [Lines 1 - 175](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/blob//pylint/checkers/non_ascii_names.py#L1-L175)\n\n This file deals with non-ASCII names checking, which is closely related to the issue of handling Unicode characters in pylint.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint/checkers)- [Lines 922 - 982](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/blob//pylint/checkers/strings.py#L922-L982)\n\n This file contains logic for processing string tokens, which may include regex patterns and could be relevant to the issue with the '\\p{Han}' pattern.",
