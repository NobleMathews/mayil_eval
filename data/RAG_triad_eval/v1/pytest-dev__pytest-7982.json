For some reason I added a `follow_symlinks=False` in there, I don't remember why, but it does not match the previous behavior and should be removed.\r\n\r\nPR for this is coming up.\n",

The RESPONSE then provides actionable advice on how to revert the parameter change if it was indeed set to `False`, and to ensure that the default behavior is restored. It also covers the possibility of the issue being related to configuration or command-line options and suggests updating those accordingly. Finally, the RESPONSE advises testing the changes and preparing a pull request, which is a standard practice in software development. The inclusion of a code snippet to check is also valuable, as it directs the developer to a potential location in the codebase where the issue might be found. The RESPONSE does not score a perfect 10 because it does not explicitly mention the need to verify the historical behavior before the regression to ensure that the fix restores the intended functionality, which would have been the final step to fully address the issue.",
