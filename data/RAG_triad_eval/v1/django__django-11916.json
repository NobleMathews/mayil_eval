(In reality the ratio is 0.2 vs 2 seconds due to overhead of profiling not affecting the execute time but having a big effect on other parts).\nThe big \"failure\" in above profile is the creation of related querysets:\n4640\t0.018\t0.000\t3.917\t0.001 manager.py:132(all)\nthis takes more than half (approx 57%) of the total runtime. Every cycle here is wasted - we don't ever need the related queryset when using the prefetched results.\nI see two options here:\nAllow assigning the results to somewhere else than manager.all() (that is, a plain list you can name). This would naturally get rid of the overhead, but then you will need to alter code to explicitly use the named list when that is available.\nSomehow lazily instantiate the .all() queryset. If prefetch is in effect calling relmanager.all() will not create a queryset, it just creates a proxy which when iterated gives the related objects, but works otherwise like the related queryset (*not* like manager).\nI prefer option 2 as this doesn't require any new APIs or changes to user code to take advantage of this feature. However creating a proxy object that works like the related queryset except for iteration, and which doesn't involve actually creating that queryset will likely be an interesting technical challenge (for example it would be nice to ensure isinstance(obj.operating_systems.all(), QuerySet) == True. Solving this challenge will likely speed up some prefetch_related queries by 50% or so.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of making `prefetch_related` faster by lazily creating related querysets, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Create a proxy object that mimics the behavior of a `QuerySet` without actually executing the database query until iteration is required.\n- Override the `all()` method of the related manager to return this proxy object instead of a real `QuerySet`.\n- Ensure that the proxy object can handle all `QuerySet` methods that do not require database access (like `filter()` and `exclude()` that add to the query but do not evaluate it) by storing these calls and applying them when the queryset is finally evaluated.\n- When the queryset is evaluated (for example, when iterated over), apply all stored calls to a real `QuerySet` and execute the database query.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the implementation:\n\n1. Define a `LazyQuerySetProxy` class that will act as a proxy for the actual `QuerySet`:\n\n```python\nclass LazyQuerySetProxy:\n    def __init__(self, model, prefetch_related_lookups):\n        self.model = model\n        self.prefetch_related_lookups = prefetch_related_lookups\n        self._queryset = None\n        self._queryset_method_calls = []\n\n    def _evaluate(self):\n        if self._queryset is None:\n            self._queryset = QuerySet(self.model).prefetch_related(*self.prefetch_related_lookups)\n            for method_name, args, kwargs in self._queryset_method_calls:\n                getattr(self._queryset, method_name)(*args, **kwargs)\n        return self._queryset\n\n    def __getattr__(self, item):\n        if hasattr(QuerySet, item):\n            def method(*args, **kwargs):\n                if self._queryset is not None:\n                    return getattr(self._queryset, item)(*args, **kwargs)\n                else:\n                    self._queryset_method_calls.append((item, args, kwargs))\n                    return self\n            return method\n        raise AttributeError(f\"'{type(self).__name__}' object has no attribute '{item}'\")\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return iter(self._evaluate())\n\n    def __bool__(self):\n        return bool(self._evaluate())\n\n    # Implement other methods that require evaluation like __len__, count, etc.\n```\n\n2. Modify the `get_prefetch_queryset` method in `related_descriptors.py` to return an instance of `LazyQuerySetProxy` instead of a real `QuerySet`:\n\n```python\ndef get_prefetch_queryset(self, instances, queryset=None):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # Replace the following line:\n    # queryset = queryset.filter(**query)\n    # With:\n    queryset = LazyQuerySetProxy(self.model, [query])\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n    return (\n        queryset,\n        rel_obj_attr,\n        instance_attr,\n        True,\n        self.field.get_cache_name(),\n        False,\n    )\n```\n\n3. Ensure that `isinstance(obj.operating_systems.all(), QuerySet) == True` by making `LazyQuerySetProxy` inherit from `QuerySet` or by implementing the necessary methods to mimic `QuerySet` behavior.\n\n4. Test the implementation thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly with all `QuerySet` methods and that it provides the expected performance improvements.\n\nThis is a complex task that involves a deep understanding of Django's ORM, particularly how `prefetch_related` works. The implementation details may vary depending on the Django version and the specifics of the project. The above code provides a conceptual framework and may require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 155 - 199](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L155-L199)\n\n This snippet contains the get_prefetch_queryset method which is directly related to the creation of related querysets, which is the main performance issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 705 - 749](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L705-L749)\n\n This snippet includes the get_prefetch_queryset method for related descriptors, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 77 - 112](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L77-L112)\n\n This snippet includes a utility function _filter_prefetch_queryset used within get_prefetch_queryset, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 2336 - 2387](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2336-L2387)\n\n This snippet is part of the prefetch_related_objects process and shows how the prefetched objects are handled, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2272 - 2334](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2272-L2334)\n\n This snippet is part of the prefetch_related_objects process and shows how the prefetching levels are managed, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2520 - 2552](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2520-L2552)\n\n This snippet shows how prefetched objects are assigned to the instance's cache, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 2518](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1-L2518)\n\n This snippet provides context for the prefetch_related_objects helper function, which is relevant to understanding the overall prefetching process. \n\n\n   - [Lines 291 - 370](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L291-L370)\n\n This snippet defines the QuerySet class, which is the type of object that the issue aims to lazily instantiate to improve performance.",

        "solution_task": "To implement the feature of making `prefetch_related` faster by lazily creating related querysets, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Create a proxy object that mimics the behavior of a `QuerySet` without actually executing the database query until iteration is required.\n- Override the `all()` method of the related manager to return this proxy object instead of a real `QuerySet`.\n- Ensure that the proxy object can handle all `QuerySet` methods that do not require database access (like `filter()` and `exclude()` that add to the query but do not evaluate it) by storing these calls and applying them when the queryset is finally evaluated.\n- When the queryset is evaluated (for example, when iterated over), apply all stored calls to a real `QuerySet` and execute the database query.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the implementation:\n\n1. Define a `LazyQuerySetProxy` class that will act as a proxy for the actual `QuerySet`:\n\n```python\nclass LazyQuerySetProxy:\n    def __init__(self, model, prefetch_related_lookups):\n        self.model = model\n        self.prefetch_related_lookups = prefetch_related_lookups\n        self._queryset = None\n        self._queryset_method_calls = []\n\n    def _evaluate(self):\n        if self._queryset is None:\n            self._queryset = QuerySet(self.model).prefetch_related(*self.prefetch_related_lookups)\n            for method_name, args, kwargs in self._queryset_method_calls:\n                getattr(self._queryset, method_name)(*args, **kwargs)\n        return self._queryset\n\n    def __getattr__(self, item):\n        if hasattr(QuerySet, item):\n            def method(*args, **kwargs):\n                if self._queryset is not None:\n                    return getattr(self._queryset, item)(*args, **kwargs)\n                else:\n                    self._queryset_method_calls.append((item, args, kwargs))\n                    return self\n            return method\n        raise AttributeError(f\"'{type(self).__name__}' object has no attribute '{item}'\")\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return iter(self._evaluate())\n\n    def __bool__(self):\n        return bool(self._evaluate())\n\n    # Implement other methods that require evaluation like __len__, count, etc.\n```\n\n2. Modify the `get_prefetch_queryset` method in `related_descriptors.py` to return an instance of `LazyQuerySetProxy` instead of a real `QuerySet`:\n\n```python\ndef get_prefetch_queryset(self, instances, queryset=None):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # Replace the following line:\n    # queryset = queryset.filter(**query)\n    # With:\n    queryset = LazyQuerySetProxy(self.model, [query])\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n    return (\n        queryset,\n        rel_obj_attr,\n        instance_attr,\n        True,\n        self.field.get_cache_name(),\n        False,\n    )\n```\n\n3. Ensure that `isinstance(obj.operating_systems.all(), QuerySet) == True` by making `LazyQuerySetProxy` inherit from `QuerySet` or by implementing the necessary methods to mimic `QuerySet` behavior.\n\n4. Test the implementation thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly with all `QuerySet` methods and that it provides the expected performance improvements.\n\nThis is a complex task that involves a deep understanding of Django's ORM, particularly how `prefetch_related` works. The implementation details may vary depending on the Django version and the specifics of the project. The above code provides a conceptual framework and may require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase.",

        "result": "To implement the feature of making `prefetch_related` faster by lazily creating related querysets, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Create a proxy object that mimics the behavior of a `QuerySet` without actually executing the database query until iteration is required.\n- Override the `all()` method of the related manager to return this proxy object instead of a real `QuerySet`.\n- Ensure that the proxy object can handle all `QuerySet` methods that do not require database access (like `filter()` and `exclude()` that add to the query but do not evaluate it) by storing these calls and applying them when the queryset is finally evaluated.\n- When the queryset is evaluated (for example, when iterated over), apply all stored calls to a real `QuerySet` and execute the database query.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the implementation:\n\n1. Define a `LazyQuerySetProxy` class that will act as a proxy for the actual `QuerySet`:\n\n```python\nclass LazyQuerySetProxy:\n    def __init__(self, model, prefetch_related_lookups):\n        self.model = model\n        self.prefetch_related_lookups = prefetch_related_lookups\n        self._queryset = None\n        self._queryset_method_calls = []\n\n    def _evaluate(self):\n        if self._queryset is None:\n            self._queryset = QuerySet(self.model).prefetch_related(*self.prefetch_related_lookups)\n            for method_name, args, kwargs in self._queryset_method_calls:\n                getattr(self._queryset, method_name)(*args, **kwargs)\n        return self._queryset\n\n    def __getattr__(self, item):\n        if hasattr(QuerySet, item):\n            def method(*args, **kwargs):\n                if self._queryset is not None:\n                    return getattr(self._queryset, item)(*args, **kwargs)\n                else:\n                    self._queryset_method_calls.append((item, args, kwargs))\n                    return self\n            return method\n        raise AttributeError(f\"'{type(self).__name__}' object has no attribute '{item}'\")\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        return iter(self._evaluate())\n\n    def __bool__(self):\n        return bool(self._evaluate())\n\n    # Implement other methods that require evaluation like __len__, count, etc.\n```\n\n2. Modify the `get_prefetch_queryset` method in `related_descriptors.py` to return an instance of `LazyQuerySetProxy` instead of a real `QuerySet`:\n\n```python\ndef get_prefetch_queryset(self, instances, queryset=None):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # Replace the following line:\n    # queryset = queryset.filter(**query)\n    # With:\n    queryset = LazyQuerySetProxy(self.model, [query])\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n    return (\n        queryset,\n        rel_obj_attr,\n        instance_attr,\n        True,\n        self.field.get_cache_name(),\n        False,\n    )\n```\n\n3. Ensure that `isinstance(obj.operating_systems.all(), QuerySet) == True` by making `LazyQuerySetProxy` inherit from `QuerySet` or by implementing the necessary methods to mimic `QuerySet` behavior.\n\n4. Test the implementation thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly with all `QuerySet` methods and that it provides the expected performance improvements.\n\nThis is a complex task that involves a deep understanding of Django's ORM, particularly how `prefetch_related` works. The implementation details may vary depending on the Django version and the specifics of the project. The above code provides a conceptual framework and may require adjustments to fit into the actual codebase.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 155 - 199](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L155-L199)\n\n This snippet contains the get_prefetch_queryset method which is directly related to the creation of related querysets, which is the main performance issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 705 - 749](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L705-L749)\n\n This snippet includes the get_prefetch_queryset method for related descriptors, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 77 - 112](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L77-L112)\n\n This snippet includes a utility function _filter_prefetch_queryset used within get_prefetch_queryset, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 2336 - 2387](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2336-L2387)\n\n This snippet is part of the prefetch_related_objects process and shows how the prefetched objects are handled, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2272 - 2334](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2272-L2334)\n\n This snippet is part of the prefetch_related_objects process and shows how the prefetching levels are managed, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2520 - 2552](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2520-L2552)\n\n This snippet shows how prefetched objects are assigned to the instance's cache, which is relevant to the issue of optimizing prefetch_related. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 2518](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1-L2518)\n\n This snippet provides context for the prefetch_related_objects helper function, which is relevant to understanding the overall prefetching process. \n\n\n   - [Lines 291 - 370](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L291-L370)\n\n This snippet defines the QuerySet class, which is the type of object that the issue aims to lazily instantiate to improve performance.",
