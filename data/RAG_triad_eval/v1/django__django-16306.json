If not, locate the correct implementation within the file.\n- Modify the `BaseForm.__getitem__()` method to first attempt to retrieve the field from `self._bound_fields_cache` and only proceed with additional logic if a `KeyError` is raised:\n\n```python\nclass BaseForm:\n    # ...\n    def __getitem__(self, name):\n        try:\n            return self._bound_fields_cache[name]\n        except KeyError:\n            field = self.fields[name]\n            # existing logic for populating self._bound_fields_cache\n            # ...\n            return self._bound_fields_cache[name]\n```\n\n- Ensure that the logic after the `KeyError` exception populates `self._bound_fields_cache` with the new field before returning it.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [forms](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/forms)- [Lines 395 - 424](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/forms/forms.py#L395-L424)\n\n This snippet is from the file 'django/forms/forms.py' and contains the method 'visible_fields' which is likely to be part of the BaseForm class where the __getitem__ method is defined.
