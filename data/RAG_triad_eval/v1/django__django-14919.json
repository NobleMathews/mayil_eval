    "title": "Do not ignore transaction durability errors within TestCase",
    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Krzysztof Jagie\u0142\u0142o)\n\t \nCurrently there is a discrepancy in how durable atomic blocks are handled in TransactionTestCase vs TestCase. Using the former, nested durable atomic blocks will, as expected, result in a RuntimeError. Using the latter however, the error will go unnoticed as the durability check is turned off. \nI have faced some issues with this behaviour in a codebase where we heavily utilize TestCase and where we recently started to introduce durable atomic blocks \u2013 the durability errors do not surface until the code hits staging/production. The solution could be to switch over to TransactionTestCase for the test classes that hit code paths with durable atomic blocks, but having to identify which tests could be affected by this issue is a bit inconvenient. And then there is the performance penalty of using TransactionTestCase. \nSo, to the issue at hand. The durability check is disabled for TestCase because otherwise durable atomic blocks would fail immediately as TestCase wraps its tests in transactions. We could however add a marker to the transactions created by TestCase, keep a stack of active transactions and make the durability check take the stack of transactions with their respective markers into account. This way we could easily detect when a durable atomic block is directly within a transaction created by TestCase and skip the durability check only for this specific scenario. \nTo better illustrate what I am proposing here, I have prepared a PoC patch. Let me know what you think!\nPatch: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/14919\n",

Additionally, it proposes implementing a stack to track active transactions and adjusting the durability check accordingly. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies that the TransactionTestCase class should not set the new attribute to maintain its current behavior. The RESPONSE is aligned with the PROMPT's suggestion of using a marker and a stack of transactions to solve the problem.
