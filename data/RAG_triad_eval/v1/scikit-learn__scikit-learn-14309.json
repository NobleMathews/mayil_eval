The problem appears to be related to the presence of a ```classes_``` attribute (with a value of ```None```) on the estimator, despite it being a regressor and not a classifier. Deleting the ```classes_``` attribute from the estimator allows ```plot_partial_dependence()``` to successfully run.\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom sklearn.inspection import plot_partial_dependence\r\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nX = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])\r\ny = np.array([[3.0], [7.0]])\r\nlearn = DecisionTreeRegressor().fit(X, y)\r\nassert getattr(learn, 'classes_') is None\r\ndelete_classes_attribute = False\r\nif delete_classes_attribute:\r\n    # Deleting the 'classes_' attribute will allow plot_partial_dependence() to run\r\n    delattr(learn, 'classes_')\r\nplot_partial_dependence(learn, X, features=[0])\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\r\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation\r\n\r\ndocs = [\"Help I have a bug\" for i in range(1000)]\r\n\r\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer(input=docs, analyzer='word')\r\nlda_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(docs)\r\n\r\nlda_model = LatentDirichletAllocation(\r\n    n_topics=10,\r\n    learning_method='online',\r\n    evaluate_every=10,\r\n    n_jobs=4,\r\n)\r\nmodel = lda_model.fit(lda_features)\r\n```\r\nIf the code is too long, feel free to put it in a public gist and link\r\nit in the issue: https://gist.github.com\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nNo error is thrown.\r\n<!-- Example: No error is thrown.

Due to the limits of human perception, the\nsize of the set of features of interest must be small (usually, one or two)\nthus they are usually chosen among the most important features.\n\nSimilarly, an individual conditional expectation (ICE) plot [3]_\nshows the dependence between the target function and a feature of interest.\nHowever, unlike partial dependence plots, which show the average effect of the\nfeatures of interest, ICE plots visualize the dependence of the prediction on a\nfeature for each :term:`sample` separately, with one line per sample.\nOnly one feature of interest is supported for ICE plots.\n\nThis example shows how to obtain partial dependence and ICE plots from a\n:class:`~sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor` and a\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` trained on the\nbike sharing dataset. The example is inspired by [1]_.\n\n..
