    "mayil_response": "To implement the requested feature for better canonicalization of variables of `Derivative`, you need to modify the `_sort_variable_count` method in `sympy/core/function.py`. The goal is to ensure that any symbols not in the free symbols of the function, but appearing after functions in the differentiation variables, are moved before the functions.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the steps to implement the feature:\n\n- Modify the `_sort_variable_count` method to include additional logic that checks the free symbols of each function involved in the differentiation.\n- When sorting the variables, ensure that symbols not present in the free symbols of any function are moved before any function variables in the list.\n- Update the sorting algorithm to maintain the canonical order while applying the new rule.\n\nHere's a pseudo-code outline of the changes to be made in the `_sort_variable_count` method:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.function import Derivative, Tuple\nfrom sympy.utilities.iterables import uniq, topological_sort\n\ndef _sort_variable_count(vc):\n    # Existing code to prepare the vc list and define helper functions...\n\n    # New logic to move symbols not in the free symbols of functions before the functions\n    def should_precede(v1, v2):\n        # If v1 is a symbol and not in the free symbols of v2 (when v2 is a function), it should precede v2\n        if isinstance(v1, Symbol) and isinstance(v2, Function) and v1 not in v2.free_symbols:\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    # Modify the existing sorting logic to incorporate the new rule\n    for i in range(len(vc)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if should_precede(v(j), v(i)):\n                # Add an edge to indicate that v(j) should come before v(i)\n                E.append((j, i))\n            # Existing logic to determine if v(j) blocks v(i)...\n\n    # Use topological_sort to sort the variables according to the new rules and existing rules\n    new_order = topological_sort([V, E])\n    vc = [vc[i] for i in new_order]\n\n    # Existing code to return the sorted list...\n    return vc\n```\n\nRemember to integrate this logic with the existing sorting rules to maintain the overall canonical order. The `should_precede` function is a new addition that checks if a symbol should be moved before a function based on the new rule described in the feature request.\n\nAfter implementing the new sorting logic, ensure to add unit tests to verify that the canonicalization works as expected, especially for edge cases.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 1 - 1568](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L1-L1568)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation of '_sort_variable_count' which is directly related to the canonicalization issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 184 - 1482](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L184-L1482)\n\n This snippet references 'Derivative._sort_variable_count' in the context of canonical representation, which is relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1266 - 1337](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L1266-L1337)\n\n This snippet deals with the processing of variables in the Derivative class, which may need to be reviewed for the canonicalization issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 184 - 1673](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L184-L1673)\n\n This snippet includes properties related to variables and counts in Derivative, which could be involved in the canonicalization process. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1406 - 3236](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L1406-L3236)\n\n This snippet includes logic for handling derivatives and making expressions canonical, which is relevant to the issue.",
