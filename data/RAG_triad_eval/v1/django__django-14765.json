    "body": "Description\n\t\n\u200bPR #14760 made all calls to ProjectState.__init__() pass real_apps as a set. In \u200bProjectState.__init__() now, then, instead of checking that real_apps is a set and converting it to a set if not, it can just assert that it's a set when non-None. (Presumably the construction of new ProjectState objects is part of Django's internal API.) I had made this comment on the PR, but it wasn't important enough to hold up the PR because another PR was depending on it getting merged.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Modify the `ProjectState.__init__()` method in `django/db/migrations/state.py` to include an assertion that `real_apps` is a set when it is not `None`.\n- The assertion should be placed after the `real_apps` default value is set and before any further processing of `real_apps`.\n- The modified `__init__` method should look like this:\n\n```python\nclass ProjectState:\n    def __init__(self, models=None, real_apps=None):\n        self.models = models or {}\n        assert real_apps is None or isinstance(real_apps, set), \"real_apps must be a set or None\"\n        self.real_apps = real_apps if real_apps is not None else set()\n        self.is_delayed = False\n        # ... rest of the initialization code ...\n```\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 34 - 140](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/state.py#L34-L140)\n\n This snippet contains the __init__ method of ProjectState where the real_apps parameter is being checked and converted to a set if it's not None. The issue specifically mentions that this check is no longer necessary and can be replaced with an assertion.",

It suggests modifying the `ProjectState.__init__()` method to include an assertion that checks if `real_apps` is a set when it is not `None`. This directly addresses the issue raised in the PROMPT, which is to replace the existing check and conversion with an assertion. The RESPONSE also provides the exact location in the code where the change should be made and offers a code snippet showing how the modified `__init__` method should look, which is highly relevant and useful for implementing the fix. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not address the comment about the construction of new ProjectState objects being part of Django's internal API, which could have implications for the change.",
