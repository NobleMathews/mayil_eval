    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue is that `sys.path` is being modified incorrectly when running pylint programmatically with `runpy.run_module`. The first item is being removed from `sys.path` without checking its value, which can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\nTo address this issue, the following changes should be made to the `modify_sys_path` function in `pylint/__init__.py`:\n\n- Ensure that the first item is only removed from `sys.path` if it is an empty string, `\".\"`, or the current working directory.\n- Add additional checks to handle cases where `PYTHONPATH` environment variable affects `sys.path`.\n\nHere is the updated `modify_sys_path` function:\n\n```python\ndef modify_sys_path() -> None:\n    \"\"\"Modify sys path for execution as Python module.\n\n    Strip out the current working directory from sys.path.\n    Having the working directory in `sys.path` means that `pylint` might\n    inadvertently import user code from modules having the same name as\n    stdlib or pylint's own modules.\n    CPython issue: https://bugs.python.org/issue33053\n    \"\"\"\n    cwd = os.getcwd()\n    if sys.path[0] in (\"\", \".\", cwd):\n        sys.path.pop(0)\n    env_pythonpath = os.environ.get(\"PYTHONPATH\", \"\")\n    if env_pythonpath.startswith(\":\") and cwd not in env_pythonpath:\n        sys.path.pop(0)\n    elif env_pythonpath.endswith(\":\") and cwd not in env_pythonpath:\n        sys.path.pop(1)\n```\n\nThis updated function will now correctly handle the `sys.path` modification, ensuring that the first item is only removed when appropriate, and taking into account the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint)- [Lines 69 - 98](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/blob//pylint/__init__.py#L69-L98)\n\n This snippet contains the code that modifies sys.path and is directly related to the issue described. It shows the current logic for removing the first entry from sys.path, which needs to be adjusted according to the issue's expected behavior.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/tree//pylint)- [Lines 1 - 10](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.15/blob//pylint/__main__.py#L1-L10)\n\n This snippet shows the actual call to 'modify_sys_path' which is the function causing the issue. It is necessary to understand how the function is invoked in the context of the application.",
