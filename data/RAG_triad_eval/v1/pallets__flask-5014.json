If there are still problems with blueprints having empty names, it may be due to other parts of the code bypassing this constructor or not using the `Blueprint` class correctly. Ensure that all blueprint instances are created using this constructor and that the name is not modified after the object is created.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [src](https://github.com/testbed/pallets__flask__2.3/tree//src) \u2192 [flask](https://github.com/testbed/pallets__flask__2.3/tree//src/flask) \u2192 [sansio](https://github.com/testbed/pallets__flask__2.3/tree//src/flask/sansio)- [Lines 41 - 244](https://github.com/testbed/pallets__flask__2.3/blob//src/flask/sansio/blueprints.py#L41-L244)\n\n This snippet includes the constructor for the Blueprint class, which is where the validation for the 'name' parameter should be added to raise a ValueError if an empty name is provided.",

It uses the\n    same decorators as :class:`~flask.Flask`, but defers the need for an\n    application by recording them for later registration.\n\n    Decorating a function with a blueprint creates a deferred function\n    that is called with :class:`~flask.blueprints.BlueprintSetupState`\n    when the blueprint is registered on an application.\n\n    See :doc:`/blueprints` for more information.\n\n    :param name: The name of the blueprint. Will be prepended to each\n        endpoint name.\n    :param import_name: The name of the blueprint package, usually\n        ``__name__``. This helps locate the ``root_path`` for the\n        blueprint.\n    :param static_folder: A folder with static files that should be\n        served by the blueprint's static route.

The path is relative to the\n        blueprint's root path. Blueprint templates are disabled by\n        default. Blueprint templates have a lower precedence than those\n        in the app's templates folder.\n    :param url_prefix: A path to prepend to all of the blueprint's URLs,\n        to make them distinct from the rest of the app's routes.\n    :param subdomain: A subdomain that blueprint routes will match on by\n        default.\n    :param url_defaults: A dict of default values that blueprint routes\n        will receive by default.\n    :param root_path: By default, the blueprint will automatically set\n        this based on ``import_name``. In certain situations this\n        automatic detection can fail, so the path can be specified\n        manually instead.\n\n    .. versionchanged:: 1.1.0\n        Blueprints have a ``cli`` group to register nested CLI commands.\n        The ``cli_group`` parameter controls the name of the group under\n        the ``flask`` command.\n\n    .. versionadded:: 0.7\n    \"\"\"\n\n    _got_registered_once = False",
