    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by David Sanders)\n\t \nThis may be intentional behaviour but the docs don't mention this so creating a ticket to update docs or correct behaviour:\nIf you create a migration with a custom name:\n$ ./manage.py makemigrations --name foo\nMigrations for 'update_rename':\n update_rename/migrations/0001_foo.py\n\t- Create model Foo\nthen running --update will change the name \"foo\" to the autogenerated one based on the operations:\n$ ./manage.py makemigrations --update\nMigrations for 'update_rename':\n update_rename/migrations/0001_initial.py\n\t- Create model Foo\nDeleted update_rename/migrations/0001_foo.py\nMy opinion is that it shouldn't as it violates the principle of least astonishment even though the --name argument wasn't supplied.\nEDIT:\nThis is my first time using --update and here are a few other observations which could indicate that it requires broader discussion:\nIt doesn't utilise the --name argument so it's impossible to customise the name during --update\nIt'd be nice to provide --no-optimize option to --update, here's my use-case: 3-step non-null field addition. After doing nullable step 1, elidable data migration step 2, I want to merge the step 3 non-null update into the migration but --update optimizes this into a single step.\nPerhaps --update requires a rethink?\n",

    "mayil_response": "- In the `makemigrations.py` file, locate the section where the `--update` flag is handled and the migration name is being updated.\n- Modify the logic that generates the new migration name to respect the custom name provided by the `--name` option.\n- Ensure that if the `--name` option is provided, it is used as the base for the new migration name instead of generating a new one based on the `suggest_name()` method.\n- Update the code that sets `new_name` to use the custom name provided by the `--name` option directly if it is not `None`.\n- Here is a suggested change to the `makemigrations.py` file:\n\n```python\n# Update name.\nprevious_migration_path = MigrationWriter(leaf_migration).path\nif self.migration_name:  # Check if custom name is provided\n    new_name = leaf_migration.name[:4] + f\"_{self.migration_name}\"\nelse:\n    name_fragment = leaf_migration.suggest_name()\n    suggested_name = leaf_migration.name[:4] + f\"_{name_fragment}\"\n    if leaf_migration.name == suggested_name:\n        new_name = leaf_migration.name + \"_updated\"\n    else:\n        new_name = suggested_name\nleaf_migration.name = new_name\n```\n\n- Ensure that this change is made within the appropriate conditional block that checks for the `--update` flag.\n- Test the updated command with both `--name` and `--update` options to verify that the custom name is now being respected.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 267 - 325](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L267-L325)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for the 'makemigrations --update' command, which is directly related to the issue of respecting the '--name' option during an update.",
