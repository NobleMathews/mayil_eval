    "body": "#### Description\r\nWith MLPClassifer, when warm_start is True or coeffs_ are provided, fit doesn\u2019t respect max_iters. The reason for this is, when fitting, max iteration check is equality (==) against self.n_iter_. When warm_start is true or coeffs_ are provided, initialize is not called; this method resets n_iter_ to 0. Based on this implementation, there is doubt as to the meaning of max_iter. Consider, if max_iter is 1 and fit terminates due to reaching maximum iterations, subsequent fittings with warm_start true will never terminate due to reaching maximum iterations. This is bug. An alternate interpretation is max_iter represents the maximum iterations per fit call. In this case, the implementation is also wrong. The later interpretation seems more reasonable.\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\r\n\r\nX = np.random.rand(100,10)\r\ny = np.random.random_integers(0, 1, (100,))\r\n\r\nclf = MLPClassifier(max_iter=1, warm_start=True, verbose=True)\r\nfor k in range(3):\r\n    clf.fit(X, y)\r\n```\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nIteration 1, loss = 0.72311215\r\nConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations reached and the optimization hasn't converged yet.\r\nIteration 2, loss = 0.71843526\r\nConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations reached and the optimization hasn't converged yet.\r\nIteration 3, loss = 0.71418678\r\nConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations reached and the optimization hasn't converged yet.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\nIteration 1, loss = 0.72311215\r\nConvergenceWarning: Stochastic Optimizer: Maximum iterations reached and the optimization hasn't converged yet.\r\nIteration 2, loss = 0.71843526\r\nIteration 3, loss = 0.71418678\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\nWindows-7-6.1.7601-SP1\r\nPython 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 08:06:12) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\nNumPy 1.12.0\r\nSciPy 0.18.1\r\nScikit-Learn 0.18.1\r\n\r\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Ensure that the `MLPClassifier`'s `fit` method properly handles the `warm_start` parameter by checking if `self.n_iter_` is reset to 0 when `warm_start` is `False`. If `warm_start` is `True`, it should continue from the last `n_iter_` value.\n- Modify the `fit` method to raise a `ConvergenceWarning` if the optimization hasn't converged after reaching the maximum number of iterations specified by `max_iter`.\n- In the `fit` method, when `warm_start` is `True` and `max_iter` is reached without convergence, the method should either stop and warn the user or reset `n_iter_` and continue training for `max_iter` more epochs, depending on the intended behavior.\n- If `coeffs_` are provided and `max_iter` is reached without convergence, the method should behave consistently with the behavior defined for `warm_start`.\n- Ensure that the `initialize` method is called appropriately to reset `n_iter_` when `warm_start` is `False` or when fitting the model for the first time.\n- If the `initialize` method is not present, create it to initialize or reset necessary attributes, including `n_iter_`.\n- If the `fit` method is supposed to raise a `ConvergenceWarning`, ensure that the warning is imported from `sklearn.exceptions` and used correctly.\n- Review the logic that checks if the optimization has converged (e.g., based on the change in loss function) and ensure it is correctly implemented before incrementing `self.n_iter_`.\n- If the `fit` method includes a loop over iterations, ensure that the loop condition checks against `self.max_iter` and that `self.n_iter_` is incremented correctly within the loop.\n- If the issue is related to the ambiguity in the meaning of `max_iter`, clarify the behavior in the documentation and ensure the code's behavior is consistent with the documentation.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [neural_network](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/tree//sklearn/neural_network)- [Lines 766 - 1645](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__1.3/blob//sklearn/neural_network/_multilayer_perceptron.py#L766-L1645)\n\n This snippet is from the file where the MLPClassifier is implemented and contains the relevant parameters and attributes, including 'max_iter', 'warm_start', and 'n_iter_', which are directly related to the issue described.",

For example if weights look unstructured,\nmaybe some were not used at all, or if very large coefficients exist, maybe\nregularization was too low or the learning rate too high.\n\nThis example shows how to plot some of the first layer weights in a\nMLPClassifier trained on the MNIST dataset.\n\nThe input data consists of 28x28 pixel handwritten digits, leading to 784\nfeatures in the dataset. Therefore the first layer weight matrix has the shape\n(784, hidden_layer_sizes[0]).  We can therefore visualize a single column of\nthe weight matrix as a 28x28 pixel image.\n\nTo make the example run faster, we use very few hidden units, and train only\nfor a very short time. Training longer would result in weights with a much\nsmoother spatial appearance. The example will throw a warning because it\ndoesn't converge, in this case this is what we want because of resource\nusage constraints on our Continuous Integration infrastructure that is used\nto build this documentation on a regular basis.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport warnings\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\nfrom sklearn.exceptions import ConvergenceWarning\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n\n# Load data from https://www.openml.org/d/554\nX, y = fetch_openml(\n    \"mnist_784\", version=1, return_X_y=True, as_frame=False, parser=\"pandas\"\n)\nX = X / 255.0\n\n# Split data into train partition and test partition\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, random_state=0, test_size=0.7)\n\nmlp = MLPClassifier(\n    hidden_layer_sizes=(40,),\n    max_iter=8,\n    alpha=1e-4,\n    solver=\"sgd\",\n    verbose=10,\n    random_state=1,\n    learning_rate_init=0.2,\n)\n\n# this example won't converge because of resource usage constraints on\n# our Continuous Integration infrastructure, so we catch the warning and\n# ignore it here\nwith warnings.catch_warnings():\n    warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=ConvergenceWarning, module=\"sklearn\")\n    mlp.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\nprint(\"Training set score: %f\" % mlp.score(X_train, y_train))\nprint(\"Test set score: %f\" % mlp.score(X_test, y_test))\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 4)\n# use global min / max to ensure all weights are shown on the same scale\nvmin, vmax = mlp.coefs_[0].min(), mlp.coefs_[0].max()\nfor coef, ax in zip(mlp.coefs_[0].T, axes.ravel()):\n    ax.matshow(coef.reshape(28, 28), cmap=plt.cm.gray, vmin=0.5 * vmin, vmax=0.5 * vmax)\n    ax.set_xticks(())\n    ax.set_yticks(())\n\nplt.show()",
