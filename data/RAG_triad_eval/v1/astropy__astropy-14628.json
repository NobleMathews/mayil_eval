    "title": "Make getting a topocentric ITRS position easier",
    "body": "### What is the problem this feature will solve?\n\nRight now, it is not easy to create ITRS coordinates for sources relative to a given location (rather than geocentric), to the level that we have specific instructions on how to calculate relative `CartesianCoordinates` and then put these into an `ITRS`: https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/common_errors.html#altaz-calculations-for-earth-based-objects\r\n\r\nThis has led to numerous issues, the latest of which is #12678\n\n### Describe the desired outcome\n\nIt would be nice if as part of `EarthLocation.get_itrs()` it would be possible to get a topocentric rather than a geocentric position. In #12678, @tomfelker and @mkbrewer [suggested](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1463366166) (and below) to extend `.get_itrs()` to take not just an `obstime` but also a `location` argument, with an implementation along [the following lines](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/12678#issuecomment-1464065862):\r\n\r\n> the idea would be to simply add a `location` argument to `get_itrs()` that defaults to `None`. Then if a location is provided, `get_itrs()` would return a topocentric ITRS frame containing the difference between the object's position and that of the `location` argument. One could also use `EARTH_CENTER` as the default and always return the difference.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee #12768. Labeling this a good first issue since it is easy code wise. However, writing the tests and documentation will require understanding of how ITRS and the associated coordinate transformations work.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of getting a topocentric ITRS position easier, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `get_itrs` method in `astropy/coordinates/earth.py` to handle the `location` argument for topocentric positions.\n- Update the `ITRS` class in `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs.py` to accept a `location` argument and use it to calculate topocentric coordinates.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes needed:\n\n1. Update the `ITRS` class definition to handle a `location` argument:\n   - Add a new attribute `location` to the `ITRS` class.\n   - Modify the `earth_location` property to account for the `location` attribute when calculating EarthLocation.\n\n2. Modify the `get_itrs` method in `astropy/coordinates/earth.py`:\n   - Add a new `location` parameter to the method signature.\n   - When `location` is provided, calculate the topocentric ITRS frame by subtracting the `location` coordinates from the object's geocentric ITRS coordinates.\n\nHere's the pseudo code for the changes:\n\n```python\n# astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs.py\nclass ITRS(BaseCoordinateFrame):\n    ...\n    location = EarthLocationAttribute(default=None)  # Add default as None\n\n    @property\n    def earth_location(self):\n        ...\n        if self.location is None:\n            return EarthLocation(x=cart.x, y=cart.y, z=cart.z)\n        else:\n            # Calculate topocentric position\n            return EarthLocation(\n                x=cart.x - self.location.x,\n                y=cart.y - self.location.y,\n                z=cart.z - self.location.z,\n            )\n\n# astropy/coordinates/earth.py\ndef get_itrs(self, obstime=None, location=None):\n    ...\n    if location is None:\n        # No location provided, return geocentric ITRS coordinates\n        return ITRS(x=self.x, y=self.y, z=self.z, obstime=obstime)\n    else:\n        # Calculate topocentric ITRS coordinates\n        topocentric_itrs = ITRS(\n            x=self.x - location.x,\n            y=self.y - location.y,\n            z=self.z - location.z,\n            obstime=obstime,\n            location=location  # Pass the location to ITRS\n        )\n        return topocentric_itrs\n```\n\nAfter implementing these changes, you should write tests to ensure that the topocentric ITRS positions are calculated correctly. You should also update the documentation to reflect the new feature and provide examples of how to use the `get_itrs` method with the `location` argument for topocentric positions.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [astropy](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/tree//astropy) \u2192 [coordinates](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/tree//astropy/coordinates)- [Lines 648 - 715](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/blob//astropy/coordinates/earth.py#L648-L715)\n\n This snippet contains the `get_itrs` method in `astropy/coordinates/earth.py` which is directly related to the issue as it needs to be modified to handle a new `location` argument for topocentric ITRS positions.\n-  \u2192 [astropy](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/tree//astropy) \u2192 [coordinates](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/tree//astropy/coordinates) \u2192 [builtin_frames](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/tree//astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames)- [Lines 15 - 85](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.2/blob//astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs.py#L15-L85)\n\n This snippet from `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs.py` defines the ITRS frame and mentions topocentric frames, which is relevant to the issue as the `get_itrs` method may need to interact with this frame definition.",

                "code": "\"\"\"\n    A coordinate or frame in the International Terrestrial Reference System\n    (ITRS).  This is approximately a geocentric system, although strictly it is\n    defined by a series of reference locations near the surface of the Earth (the ITRF).\n    For more background on the ITRS, see the references provided in the\n    :ref:`astropy:astropy-coordinates-seealso` section of the documentation.\n\n    This frame also includes frames that are defined *relative* to the center of the Earth,\n    but that are offset (in both position and velocity) from the center of the Earth. You\n    may see such non-geocentric coordinates referred to as \"topocentric\".\n\n    Topocentric ITRS frames are convenient for observations of near Earth objects where\n    stellar aberration is not included. One can merely subtract the observing site's\n    EarthLocation geocentric ITRS coordinates from the object's geocentric ITRS coordinates,\n    put the resulting vector into a topocentric ITRS frame and then transform to\n    `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz` or `~astropy.coordinates.HADec`. The other way around is\n    to transform an observed `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz` or `~astropy.coordinates.HADec`\n    position to a topocentric ITRS frame and add the observing site's EarthLocation geocentric\n    ITRS coordinates to yield the object's geocentric ITRS coordinates.\n\n    On the other hand, using ``transform_to`` to transform geocentric ITRS coordinates to\n    topocentric ITRS, observed `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz`, or observed\n    `~astropy.coordinates.HADec` coordinates includes the difference between stellar aberration\n    from the point of view of an observer at the geocenter and stellar aberration from the\n    point of view of an observer on the surface of the Earth. If the geocentric ITRS\n    coordinates of the object include stellar aberration at the geocenter (e.g. certain ILRS\n    ephemerides), then this is the way to go.\n\n    Note to ILRS ephemeris users: Astropy does not currently consider relativistic\n    effects of the Earth's gravatational field. Nor do the `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz`\n    or `~astropy.coordinates.HADec` refraction corrections compute the change in the\n    range due to the curved path of light through the atmosphere, so Astropy is no\n    substitute for the ILRS software in these respects.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    default_representation = CartesianRepresentation\n    default_differential = CartesianDifferential\n\n    obstime = TimeAttribute(default=DEFAULT_OBSTIME)\n    location = EarthLocationAttribute(default=EARTH_CENTER)\n\n    @property\n    def earth_location(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        The data in this frame as an `~astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation` class.\n        \"\"\"\n        from astropy.coordinates.earth import EarthLocation\n\n        cart = self.represent_as(CartesianRepresentation)\n        return EarthLocation(\n            x=cart.x + self.location.x,\n            y=cart.y + self.location.y,\n            z=cart.z + self.location.z,\n        )",

This is approximately a geocentric system, although strictly it is\n    defined by a series of reference locations near the surface of the Earth (the ITRF).\n    For more background on the ITRS, see the references provided in the\n    :ref:`astropy:astropy-coordinates-seealso` section of the documentation.\n\n    This frame also includes frames that are defined *relative* to the center of the Earth,\n    but that are offset (in both position and velocity) from the center of the Earth. You\n    may see such non-geocentric coordinates referred to as \"topocentric\".\n\n    Topocentric ITRS frames are convenient for observations of near Earth objects where\n    stellar aberration is not included. One can merely subtract the observing site's\n    EarthLocation geocentric ITRS coordinates from the object's geocentric ITRS coordinates,\n    put the resulting vector into a topocentric ITRS frame and then transform to\n    `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz` or `~astropy.coordinates.HADec`. The other way around is\n    to transform an observed `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz` or `~astropy.coordinates.HADec`\n    position to a topocentric ITRS frame and add the observing site's EarthLocation geocentric\n    ITRS coordinates to yield the object's geocentric ITRS coordinates.\n\n    On the other hand, using ``transform_to`` to transform geocentric ITRS coordinates to\n    topocentric ITRS, observed `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz`, or observed\n    `~astropy.coordinates.HADec` coordinates includes the difference between stellar aberration\n    from the point of view of an observer at the geocenter and stellar aberration from the\n    point of view of an observer on the surface of the Earth. If the geocentric ITRS\n    coordinates of the object include stellar aberration at the geocenter (e.g. certain ILRS\n    ephemerides), then this is the way to go.\n\n    Note to ILRS ephemeris users: Astropy does not currently consider relativistic\n    effects of the Earth's gravatational field. Nor do the `~astropy.coordinates.AltAz`\n    or `~astropy.coordinates.HADec` refraction corrections compute the change in the\n    range due to the curved path of light through the atmosphere, so Astropy is no\n    substitute for the ILRS software in these respects.\n\n    \"\"\"\n\n    default_representation = CartesianRepresentation\n    default_differential = CartesianDifferential\n\n    obstime = TimeAttribute(default=DEFAULT_OBSTIME)\n    location = EarthLocationAttribute(default=EARTH_CENTER)\n\n    @property\n    def earth_location(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        The data in this frame as an `~astropy.coordinates.EarthLocation` class.\n        \"\"\"\n        from astropy.coordinates.earth import EarthLocation\n\n        cart = self.represent_as(CartesianRepresentation)\n        return EarthLocation(\n            x=cart.x + self.location.x,\n            y=cart.y + self.location.y,\n            z=cart.z + self.location.z,\n        )",
