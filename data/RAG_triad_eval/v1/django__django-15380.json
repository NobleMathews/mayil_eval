    "mayil_response": "- Review the `generate_renamed_fields` method in the `MigrationAutodetector` class within `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` to ensure that it correctly handles the case when a model has been renamed.\n- Ensure that `self.from_state.models` and `self.to_state.models` are correctly accessed with the appropriate `(app_label, model_name)` keys, accounting for any model renames that may have occurred.\n- Check if the regression commit `aa4acc164d1247c0de515c959f7b09648b57dc42` introduced changes to the way `self.renamed_models` or `self.to_state.models` are handled and revert or fix the changes if they are causing the `KeyError`.\n- If the `KeyError` is due to a renamed model not being found in `self.to_state.models`, update the logic to handle the renamed model keys correctly, possibly by using `self.renamed_models.get((app_label, model_name), model_name)` to fetch the correct `old_model_name` before accessing `self.to_state.models`.\n- If the issue persists, add additional error handling around the access to `self.to_state.models` to provide a more informative error message or to handle the case where the key is missing gracefully.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 921 - 977](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L921-L977)\n\n This snippet contains logic for detecting renamed fields, which is relevant to the issue of the migration autodetector crashing when renaming a model and field. \n\n\n   - [Lines 522 - 977](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L522-L977)\n\n This snippet includes the logic for detecting renamed models, which is part of the issue when renaming a model and field together. \n\n\n   - [Lines 237 - 1683](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L237-L1683)\n\n This snippet deals with the handling of renamed fields and models, which is directly related to the issue at hand. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1122 - 1216](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L1122-L1216)\n\n This snippet is involved in the detection of field changes, including renames, which could be part of the problem if the autodetector is not handling renames correctly.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 98 - 525](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/models.py#L98-L525)\n\n This snippet defines the `RenameModel` operation, which could be relevant for understanding how model renames are processed and could be part of the solution or problem diagnosis.",
