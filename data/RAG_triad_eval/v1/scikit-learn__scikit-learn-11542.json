    "title": "Change default n_estimators in RandomForest (to 100?)",
    "body": "Analysis of code on github shows that people use default parameters when they shouldn't. We can make that a little bit less bad by providing reasonable defaults. The default for n_estimators is not great imho and I think we should change it. I suggest 100.\r\nWe could probably run benchmarks with openml if we want to do something empirical, but I think anything is better than 10.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I want to tag this 1.0 because really no-one should ever run a random forest with 10 trees imho and therefore deprecation of the current default will show people they have a bug.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To change the default `n_estimators` in the RandomForest to 100, you need to modify the default parameter in the RandomForest classes. Here's how you can do it:\n\n- Locate the RandomForest classes in the `_forest.py` file.\n- Update the default value of `n_estimators` from 10 to 100.\n\nHere's the code snippet to change for both `RandomForestClassifier` and `RandomForestRegressor`:\n\n```python\nclass RandomForestClassifier(ForestClassifier):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        # ... other parameters ...\n        n_estimators=100,  # Change the default value from 10 to 100\n        # ... other parameters ...\n    ):\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n\nclass RandomForestRegressor(ForestRegressor):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        # ... other parameters ...\n        n_estimators=100,  # Change the default value from 10 to 100\n        # ... other parameters ...\n    ):\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n```\n\nMake sure to update the documentation and comments that mention the default value of `n_estimators` to reflect this change. Additionally, consider adding a note in the documentation about the version in which this change was made, similar to the existing notes for other parameters.\n\nAfter making the change, you should also update any tests that rely on the default value of `n_estimators` and run the full test suite to ensure that the change does not introduce any regressions.\n\nFinally, if the project maintains a changelog or release notes, add an entry describing the change for the benefit of users who may be affected by the new default value.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn/ensemble)- [Lines 1 - 2906](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py#L1-L2906)\n\n This snippet from 'sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py' defines the default parameters for the ExtraTreesRegressor, including 'n_estimators' which is the parameter in question for the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 2906](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py#L1-L2906)\n\n This snippet from 'sklearn/ensemble/_forest.py' defines the default parameters for the RandomForestRegressor, including 'n_estimators' which is the parameter in question for the issue.",

It's a fixed numer.\n- `max_iter` is the the maximum number of iterations in a gradient boosting\n  based model. The number of iterations corresponds to the number of trees for\n  regression and binary classification problems. Furthermore, the actual number\n  of trees required by the model depends on the stopping criteria.\n\nHGBT uses gradient boosting to iteratively improve the model's performance by\nfitting each tree to the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to\nthe predicted value. RFs, on the other hand, are based on bagging and use a\nmajority vote to predict the outcome.\n\nFor more information on ensemble models, see the :ref:`User Guide <ensemble>`.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Author:  Arturo Amor <david-arturo.amor-quiroz@inria.fr>\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\n# %%\n# Load dataset\n# ------------\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing\n\nX, y = fetch_california_housing(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)\nn_samples, n_features = X.shape\n\n# %%\n# HGBT uses a histogram-based algorithm on binned feature values that can\n# efficiently handle large datasets (tens of thousands of samples or more) with\n# a high number of features (see :ref:`Why_it's_faster`).

In\n    each stage ``n_classes_`` regression trees are fit on the negative gradient\n    of the loss function, e.g. binary or multiclass log loss. Binary\n    classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is\n    induced.\n\n    :class:`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is a much faster\n    variant of this algorithm for intermediate datasets (`n_samples >= 10_000`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    loss : {'log_loss', 'exponential'}, default='log_loss'\n        The loss function to be optimized. 'log_loss' refers to binomial and\n        multinomial deviance, the same as used in logistic regression.\n        It is a good choice for classification with probabilistic outputs.\n        For loss 'exponential', gradient boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.\n\n    learning_rate : float, default=0.1\n        Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.\n        There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.\n        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.\n\n    n_estimators : int, default=100\n        The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting\n        is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually\n        results in better performance.\n        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.\n\n    subsample : float, default=1.0\n        The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base\n        learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient\n        Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.\n        Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance\n        and an increase in bias.\n        Values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`.\n\n    criterion : {'friedman_mse', 'squared_error'}, default='friedman_mse'\n        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are\n        'friedman_mse' for the mean squared error with improvement score by\n        Friedman, 'squared_error' for mean squared error. The default value of\n        'friedman_mse' is generally the best as it can provide a better\n        approximation in some cases.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.18\n\n    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2\n        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:\n\n        - If int, values must be in the range `[2, inf)`.\n        - If float, values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]` and `min_samples_split`\n          will be `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)`.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.18\n           Added float values for fractions.\n\n    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1\n        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at\n        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and\n        right branches.

The maximum\n        depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter\n        for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction\n        of the input variables.

To\n    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be\n    controlled by setting those parameter values.\n\n    The features are always randomly permuted at each split. Therefore,\n    the best found split may vary, even with the same training data,\n    ``max_features=n_features`` and ``bootstrap=False``, if the improvement\n    of the criterion is identical for several splits enumerated during the\n    search of the best split. To obtain a deterministic behaviour during\n    fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed.\n\n    The default value ``max_features=1.0`` uses ``n_features``\n    rather than ``n_features / 3``. The latter was originally suggested in\n    [1], whereas the former was more recently justified empirically in [2].\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    .. [1] L.
