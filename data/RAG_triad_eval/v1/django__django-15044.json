    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to thread safety when using `CacheMiddleware` and `FetchFromCacheMiddleware` with `pylibmc` in a `uwsgi` threaded environment. The error `poll() returned a value that was not dealt with` suggests that there might be concurrent access issues with the cache backend.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- Ensure that `pylibmc` is configured for thread safety. This can be done by setting `pylibmc` to use a thread-aware connection pool if it supports one.\n- If `pylibmc` does not support a thread-aware connection pool, consider using a different caching backend that is known to be thread-safe with Django, such as `python-memcached`.\n- Alternatively, wrap the cache access in `CacheMiddleware` and `FetchFromCacheMiddleware` with thread synchronization primitives such as locks. However, this might have performance implications.\n- If using locks, ensure that they are used in a way that prevents potential deadlocks and minimizes contention. For example, use a `threading.Lock` or `threading.RLock` in the `CacheMiddleware` and `FetchFromCacheMiddleware` classes to wrap the `cache.get(cache_key)` calls.\n- If the issue persists, consider disabling the cache middleware when running under a multi-threaded server or switch to a process-based server model with `uwsgi` if that is an acceptable solution for your deployment scenario.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [middleware](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/middleware)- [Lines 1 - 55](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/middleware/cache.py#L1-L55)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of CacheMiddleware and FetchFromCacheMiddleware, which are mentioned in the issue as not being thread safe. \n\n\n   - [Lines 130 - 176](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/middleware/cache.py#L130-L176)\n\n This snippet shows the implementation of FetchFromCacheMiddleware, which is directly related to the issue of thread safety. \n\n\n   - [Lines 179 - 211](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/middleware/cache.py#L179-L211)\n\n This snippet shows the initialization of CacheMiddleware, which is relevant to the issue as it involves the setup that may need to be made thread safe.",

The canonical way to enable cache middleware is to set\n``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` as your first piece of middleware, and\n``FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` as the last::\n\n    MIDDLEWARE = [\n        'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',\n        ...\n        'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware'\n    ]\n\nThis is counter-intuitive, but correct: ``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` needs to run\nlast during the response phase, which processes middleware bottom-up;\n``FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` needs to run last during the request phase, which\nprocesses middleware top-down.\n\nThe single-class ``CacheMiddleware`` can be used for some simple sites.\nHowever, if any other piece of middleware needs to affect the cache key, you'll\nneed to use the two-part ``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` and\n``FetchFromCacheMiddleware``. This'll most often happen when you're using\nDjango's ``LocaleMiddleware``.\n\nMore details about how the caching works:\n\n* Only GET or HEAD-requests with status code 200 are cached.\n\n* The number of seconds each page is stored for is set by the \"max-age\" section\n  of the response's \"Cache-Control\" header, falling back to the\n  CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS setting if the section was not found.\n\n* This middleware expects that a HEAD request is answered with the same response\n  headers exactly like the corresponding GET request.\n\n* When a hit occurs, a shallow copy of the original response object is returned\n  from process_request.\n\n* Pages will be cached based on the contents of the request headers listed in\n  the response's \"Vary\" header.\n\n* This middleware also sets ETag, Last-Modified, Expires and Cache-Control\n  headers on the response object.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.cache import DEFAULT_CACHE_ALIAS, caches\nfrom django.utils.cache import (\n    get_cache_key,\n    get_max_age,\n    has_vary_header,\n    learn_cache_key,\n    patch_response_headers,\n)\nfrom django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin",

The canonical way to enable cache middleware is to set\n``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` as your first piece of middleware, and\n``FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` as the last::\n\n    MIDDLEWARE = [\n        'django.middleware.cache.UpdateCacheMiddleware',\n        ...\n        'django.middleware.cache.FetchFromCacheMiddleware'\n    ]\n\nThis is counter-intuitive, but correct: ``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` needs to run\nlast during the response phase, which processes middleware bottom-up;\n``FetchFromCacheMiddleware`` needs to run last during the request phase, which\nprocesses middleware top-down.\n\nThe single-class ``CacheMiddleware`` can be used for some simple sites.\nHowever, if any other piece of middleware needs to affect the cache key, you'll\nneed to use the two-part ``UpdateCacheMiddleware`` and\n``FetchFromCacheMiddleware``. This'll most often happen when you're using\nDjango's ``LocaleMiddleware``.\n\nMore details about how the caching works:\n\n* Only GET or HEAD-requests with status code 200 are cached.\n\n* The number of seconds each page is stored for is set by the \"max-age\" section\n  of the response's \"Cache-Control\" header, falling back to the\n  CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS setting if the section was not found.\n\n* This middleware expects that a HEAD request is answered with the same response\n  headers exactly like the corresponding GET request.\n\n* When a hit occurs, a shallow copy of the original response object is returned\n  from process_request.\n\n* Pages will be cached based on the contents of the request headers listed in\n  the response's \"Vary\" header.\n\n* This middleware also sets ETag, Last-Modified, Expires and Cache-Control\n  headers on the response object.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.core.cache import DEFAULT_CACHE_ALIAS, caches\nfrom django.utils.cache import (\n    get_cache_key,\n    get_max_age,\n    has_vary_header,\n    learn_cache_key,\n    patch_response_headers,\n)\nfrom django.utils.deprecation import MiddlewareMixin",
