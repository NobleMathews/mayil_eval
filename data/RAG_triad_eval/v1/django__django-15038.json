    "mayil_response": "- Verify that the `squashmigrations` command checks for the existence of the migration file before attempting to write the new squashed migration file to prevent overwriting.\n- Ensure that the `squashmigrations` command raises a `CommandError` if the migration file already exists, as seen in the code snippet from `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py`:\n  ```python\n  if os.path.exists(writer.path):\n      raise CommandError(\n          f\"Migration {new_migration.name} already exists. Use a different name.\"\n      )\n  ```\n- Modify the `squashmigrations` command to include a `replaces` attribute in the new migration class definition to indicate which migrations it replaces. This is shown in the code snippet from `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py`:\n  ```python\n  subclass = type(\n      \"Migration\",\n      (migrations.Migration,),\n      {\n          \"dependencies\": dependencies,\n          \"operations\": new_operations,\n          \"replaces\": replaces,\n      },\n  )\n  ```\n- Ensure that the `squashmigrations` command does not allow squashing of already squashed migrations by raising a `CommandError` if the `replaces` attribute is already set, as seen in the code snippet from `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py`:\n  ```python\n  if smigration.replaces:\n      raise CommandError(\n          \"You cannot squash squashed migrations! Please transition it to a \"\n          \"normal migration first: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/%s/\"\n          \"topics/migrations/#squashing-migrations\" % get_docs_version()\n      )\n  ```\n- Check for circular dependencies by ensuring that the migration graph is not cyclic after adding the new squashed migration. This is handled in `django/db/migrations/loader.py`:\n  ```python\n  self.graph.ensure_not_cyclic()\n  ```\n- If a `CircularDependencyError` is raised, it should be caught and handled appropriately to inform the user of the issue. This exception is defined in `django/db/migrations/exceptions.py`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 96 - 253](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py#L96-L253)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for writing out the new migration file and checking if the file already exists, which is directly related to the issue of overwriting existing migration files. \n\n\n   - [Lines 63 - 133](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py#L63-L133)\n\n This snippet includes the command options and the initial setup for the squashmigrations command, which may need to be modified to handle the new error condition for existing migration files. \n\n\n   - [Lines 135 - 267](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py#L135-L267)\n\n This snippet deals with the loading and concatenation of operations from migrations to be squashed, and it includes error handling for squashing already squashed migrations, which is relevant to the issue of handling dependencies and preventing circular errors.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 85 - 305](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/loader.py#L85-L305)\n\n This snippet from the loader.py file contains logic for validating consistency of migrations and handling NodeNotFoundError, which may be relevant when considering the consistency of the migration graph after preventing overwrites.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 1 - 60](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/exceptions.py#L1-L60)\n\n This snippet defines the CircularDependencyError exception, which is mentioned in the issue description as a potential problem when overwriting migration files.",
