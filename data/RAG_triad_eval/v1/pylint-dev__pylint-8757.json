    "mayil_response": "- Investigate the handling of the `--jobs` argument in the `pylint/lint/parallel.py` file, specifically in the `check_parallel` function, to understand how parallelism is implemented and how it might affect the collection and reporting of errors and warnings.\n- Review the `pylint/lint/base_options.py` file to confirm the behavior of the `--jobs` option and its default value.\n- Ensure that the `pylint/__main__.py` file correctly initializes and invokes the parallel linting process if the `--jobs` argument is provided.\n- Check the `pylintrc` configuration file for any settings that might influence the behavior of the `no-absolute-import` and `print-statement` checks.\n- Verify that the modules `codein.callback`, `codein.types`, `main`, and `tests.test_utils` are properly importing `absolute_import` from `__future__` and not using print statements, which are not compatible with Python 3 unless imported from `__future__`.\n- If the issue persists, consider upgrading to a newer version of pylint that may have fixed known issues with parallelism in version 1.3.1.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__3.0/tree//pylint) \u2192 [lint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__3.0/tree//pylint/lint)- [Lines 124 - 173](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__3.0/blob//pylint/lint/parallel.py#L124-L173)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation of the parallel linting functionality, which is directly related to the issue of different outputs when using different job counts.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__3.0/tree//pylint) \u2192 [lint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__3.0/tree//pylint/lint)- [Lines 3 - 595](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__3.0/blob//pylint/lint/base_options.py#L3-L595)\n\n This snippet includes the definition of the 'jobs' option, which is relevant to understand how the number of jobs is configured and might be related to the issue.",
