    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Timothy Schilling)\n\t \nMy idea is to add the applied datetime value to the showmigrations command.\nI've run into the case where I'm working on a branch that involves a number of migrations across various apps, but then have to switch to a different branch which has different migrations. It can be troublesome to determine which migrations are new and need to be rolled back. I've recently started looking at the django_migrations table sorted on the applied column to determine which I've run recently. This would make switching between branches involving conflicting migrations easier.\nThere was some brief discussion \u200bhere.\nI've initially implemented this so that it would only apply to the --list option with a --verbosity of 2 and above. \u200bHere's what I have so far. I wasn't sure how to handle backporting.\n\u200bPR\nEdited to strikeout old PR and reference the one to origin.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of showing the applied datetime in the `showmigrations` command, you will need to modify the `show_list` function in the `showmigrations.py` file. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n- Import the `datetime` module to format the applied datetime.\n- Modify the `show_list` function to retrieve the applied datetime from the `recorded_migrations` and display it when the verbosity level is 2 or above.\n\nHere's the pseudo code for the changes:\n\n```python\n# In showmigrations.py\n\nfrom datetime import datetime  # Import datetime module\n\ndef show_list(self, connection, app_names=None):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # Load migrations from disk/DB\n    loader = MigrationLoader(connection, ignore_no_migrations=True)\n    recorder = MigrationRecorder(connection)\n    recorded_migrations = recorder.applied_migrations()\n    graph = loader.graph\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    for app_name in app_names:\n        # ... existing code ...\n\n        for node in graph.leaf_nodes(app_name):\n            # ... existing code ...\n\n            applied_migration = loader.applied_migrations.get(plan_node)\n            if applied_migration:\n                # ... existing code ...\n\n                # Check if verbosity is 2 or above and applied_migration has 'applied' attribute\n                if self.verbosity >= 2 and hasattr(applied_migration, 'applied'):\n                    # Format the applied datetime\n                    applied_time = applied_migration.applied.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n                    output += f\" (applied at {applied_time})\"\n                self.stdout.write(output)\n            else:\n                # ... existing code ...\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n```\n\nMake sure to test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the applied datetime is displayed correctly and that the feature works as expected when the `--verbosity` flag is set to 2 or above.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 134 - 176](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py#L134-L176)\n\n This snippet from 'showmigrations.py' is directly related to the display of migrations and their statuses, which is where the applied datetime would be added. \n\n\n   - [Lines 79 - 132](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py#L79-L132)\n\n This snippet from 'showmigrations.py' also deals with displaying migrations and includes verbosity checks, which is relevant to the issue since the applied datetime is proposed to be shown with a verbosity of 2 and above.",
