    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude15.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The issue is with computing eigenvalues of a symbolic matrix using `.eigenvals()`.\n- The error message indicates that the matrix `Matrix([[x, 0, 1], [x, 0, 2], [exp(x), 1, 0]])` is causing problems.\n- The `solve(det(lam*eye(3) - M), lam)` approach works, suggesting that the issue is with the `.eigenvals()` method and not with the symbolic computation capabilities in general.\n- The `roots(M.charpoly())` approach returns an empty set, which is also incorrect.\n\nSolution:\n- Modify the `_eigenvals()` function in `sympy/matrices/eigen.py` to handle cases where the matrix contains symbolic expressions that are not well-handled by the current implementation.\n- Ensure that the matrix is checked for triangular form, as eigenvalues for triangular matrices can be obtained directly from the diagonal.\n- If the matrix is not triangular, use numerical methods as a fallback when symbolic computation fails. This can be done by catching the `MatrixError` exception and then calling `_eigenvals_mpmath(M, multiple=multiple)` within the `_eigenvals()` function.\n- If numerical methods are also not suitable, consider implementing a more robust symbolic eigenvalue computation method that can handle the exponential function and other complex symbolic expressions.\n- Ensure that the matrix elements are simplified before attempting to compute the eigenvalues, as this can sometimes resolve issues with symbolic computation.\n- Add a check to convert floating-point numbers to rationals before computation if the `rational` flag is set to `True`. This can be done by applying `nsimplify(x, rational=True)` to each element of the matrix if it contains floats.\n- After implementing the changes, thoroughly test the `.eigenvals()` method with a variety of symbolic matrices to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy) \u2192 [matrices](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/matrices)- [Lines 329 - 413](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/matrices/determinant.py#L329-L413)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation of the characteristic polynomial computation, which is directly related to the issue of not finding eigenvalues.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy) \u2192 [matrices](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/matrices)- [Lines 80 - 176](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/matrices/eigen.py#L80-L176)\n\n This snippet includes the eigenvals function that is failing to compute the eigenvalues for the symbolic matrix, which is the core of the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 79 - 79](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/matrices/eigen.py#L79-L79)\n\n This snippet is the definition of the _eigenvals function that is likely where the issue originates. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 213](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/matrices/eigen.py#L1-L213)\n\n This snippet contains various methods for computing eigenvalues and might contain clues as to why the eigenvals method is failing.",
