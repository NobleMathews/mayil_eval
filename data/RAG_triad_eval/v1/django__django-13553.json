    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Hannes Ljungberg)\n\t \nI noticed this error while implementing a dynamic union like this:\nunion = reduce(\n\tlambda qs1, qs2: qs1.union(qs2),\n\tquerysets,\n\tqueryset.none(),\n)\nIf len(querysets) == 1 it will result in a pretty weird query throwing a database error when both querysets are ordered, another example recreating this in the test suite:\nqs1 = Number.objects.all().order_by(\u2018pk\u2019)\nqs2 = Number.objects.none().union(qs1).order_by(\u2018pk\u2019)\nExecuting qs2 result in the following query:\n(SELECT \"queries_number\".\"id\", \"queries_number\".\"num\", \"queries_number\".\"other_num\", \"queries_number\".\"another_num\" FROM \"queries_number\" ORDER BY \"queries_number\".\"id\" ASC) ORDER BY (1) ASC\nResult in the following error on PostgresSQL:\npsycopg2.errors.SyntaxError: multiple ORDER BY clauses not allowed\nLINE 1: ...umber\" ORDER BY \"queries_number\".\"id\" DESC) ORDER BY (1) ASC\nAnd sqlite:\ndjango.db.utils.DatabaseError: ORDER BY not allowed in subqueries of compound statements.\nMySQL seems to accept this query but it's most likely not the query the user expects the be executed.\nMy proposal is to simply return the non-empty query and make the union a no-op set in this case.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue arises when using `QuerySet.union()` followed by `QuerySet.order_by()` on databases that do not support multiple `ORDER BY` clauses in compound statements, such as PostgreSQL and SQLite. The error messages indicate that an `ORDER BY` clause is not allowed in subqueries of compound statements.\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n\n- Modify the `union()` method to handle the case where it is followed by an `order_by()` call. This can be done by ensuring that the `ORDER BY` clause is applied only once and at the correct level of the query.\n- If the `union()` is called with a single non-empty queryset, the `order_by()` should be applied to the final result of the `union()`, not within the subqueries.\n- Ensure that the `order_by()` clause is only included in the outermost query when using `union()` to avoid the database error.\n\nHere is a potential solution:\n\n- In the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, modify the code that generates the SQL for the `union()` operation to conditionally apply the `ORDER BY` clause based on the database's capabilities and the position of the `order_by()` call.\n- Specifically, check if `self.query.order_by` is not empty and if the database does not support ordering in compound statements (`not features.supports_slicing_ordering_in_compound`), then clear the ordering from the subqueries before combining them.\n- After combining the subqueries, apply the `order_by()` to the entire result set if it was cleared from the subqueries.\n\nHere is a code snippet that could be added or modified in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file:\n\n```python\n# Before combining the queries, clear the ordering if the database does not support it\nif not features.supports_slicing_ordering_in_compound:\n    for compiler in compilers:\n        compiler.query.clear_ordering(force_empty=True)\n\n# Combine the queries as before\n\n# After combining the queries, if the ordering was cleared, apply it to the result\nif not features.supports_slicing_ordering_in_compound and self.query.order_by:\n    result_order_by = self.get_order_by()\n    result = [\"SELECT * FROM ({}) {}\".format(result, result_order_by)]\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the `ORDER BY` clause is applied only once to the final result of the `union()` operation, avoiding the database error.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 556 - 1141](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L556-L1141)\n\n This snippet contains logic for handling combined queries and their SQL generation, which is relevant to the issue of handling union queries with order_by. \n\n\n   - [Lines 550 - 572](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L550-L572)\n\n This snippet includes checks for slicing and ordering in subqueries of compound statements, which is directly related to the issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 459 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L459-L1596)\n\n This snippet deals with the ordering of querysets and how they are resolved, which is relevant to the issue since it involves order_by on a union queryset.",
