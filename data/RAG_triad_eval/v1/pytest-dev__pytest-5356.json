But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- Pin the pytest version to 4.5.0 in the Travis CI configuration file (.travis.yml) under the `install` section by adding the command `pip install pytest==4.5.0`.\n- Investigate the `bench/skip.py` file to ensure that the `SKIP` variable is not causing tests to be skipped unintentionally. If the skipping behavior is not desired, remove or conditionally set the `SKIP` variable.\n- Check the pytest configuration file (pytest.ini or tox.ini) for any new settings introduced in pytest 4.6.0 that might be causing tests to be skipped and adjust them accordingly.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__4.6/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 9](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__4.6/blob//bench/skip.py#L1-L9)\n\n This snippet contains a test function that uses pytest.skip, which could be related to the issue of tests being skipped without apparent reason.",

However, the suggestion to investigate the `bench/skip.py` file for a `SKIP` variable that might be causing tests to be skipped unintentionally is actionable and could potentially lead to resolving the issue if such a variable is indeed the cause. The advice to check the pytest configuration file for new settings introduced in pytest 4.6.0 that might be causing tests to be skipped is also actionable and relevant. The RESPONSE includes a link to the code snippet, which is helpful, but it does not directly address the issue of why pytest 4.6.0 is skipping tests without apparent reason, nor does it provide a comprehensive solution.",

RESPONSE that is RELEVANT to some of the PROMPT should get as score of 2, 3, or 4.\nSupporting Evidence: The RESPONSE provides a potential solution to the problem described in the PROMPT by suggesting to pin the pytest version to 4.5.0, which is relevant to the user's action of rolling back to that version. It also suggests checking the `bench/skip.py` file and pytest configuration files for issues, which is somewhat relevant to the problem of tests being skipped. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific issue of tests being skipped without apparent reason in version 4.6.0, nor does it acknowledge the provided links to the Travis CI job or the pip list output. Therefore, it is only partially relevant to the PROMPT."
