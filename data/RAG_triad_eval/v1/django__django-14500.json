    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Markus Holtermann)\n\t \nWhen unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Modify the `MigrationExecutor` class to handle unapplying squashed migrations correctly.\n- In the `unapply_migration` method, after unapplying the squashed migration, iterate over the `replaces` attribute of the squashed migration and mark each replaced migration as unapplied using the `record_unapplied` method of the migration recorder.\n- Ensure that the `mark_migration_unapplied` method checks if the migration is a squashed migration and, if so, also marks all the migrations it replaces as unapplied.\n- Update the `check_replacements` method to handle the case where a squashed migration is unapplied. It should not mark the squashed migration as applied if the replaced migrations are not all applied.\n- Add error handling in the `unapply_migration` method to catch any issues that arise when marking the replaced migrations as unapplied, and provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 290 - 305](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/executor.py#L290-L305)\n\n This snippet contains the check_replacements method which is responsible for marking migrations as applied.
