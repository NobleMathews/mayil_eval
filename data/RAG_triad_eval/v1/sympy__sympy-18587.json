    "mayil_response": "The behavior you're observing is due to the fact that the `Permutation` constructor in the SymPy library does not enforce the `size` argument when the permutation is provided in array form. The `size` argument is only used when the permutation is provided in cyclic form or when a range is given.\n\nTo answer your question, there is no explicit check in the constructor to raise an exception when the length of the list provided to the `Permutation` constructor is greater than the `size` argument. This is why the `size` argument is ignored and no exception is raised.\n\nIf you want to enforce the `size` argument and raise an exception when the length of the list is greater than the `size`, you would need to modify the constructor to include this check. Here is a pseudo code snippet that demonstrates how you might add such a check:\n\n```python\n# Inside the Permutation constructor\nif size is not None and len(args) == 1 and not is_sequence(args[0][0]):\n    # args is a list with one element which is the array form of the permutation\n    if len(args[0]) > size:\n        raise ValueError(\"The length of the permutation is greater than the specified size.\")\n```\n\nThis check should be placed before the permutation is processed into its array form. If the length of the permutation list is greater than the specified `size`, a `ValueError` will be raised.",

The permutation of a given arrangement is given by\n    indicating the positions of the elements after re-arrangement [2]_. For\n    example, if one started with elements [x, y, a, b] (in that order) and\n    they were reordered as [x, y, b, a] then the permutation would be\n    [0, 1, 3, 2]. Notice that (in SymPy) the first element is always referred\n    to as 0 and the permutation uses the indices of the elements in the\n    original ordering, not the elements (a, b, etc...) themselves.\n\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics import Permutation\n    >>> from sympy.interactive import init_printing\n    >>> init_printing(perm_cyclic=False, pretty_print=False)\n\n    Permutations Notation\n    =====================\n\n    Permutations are commonly represented in disjoint cycle or array forms.\n\n    Array Notation and 2-line Form\n    ------------------------------------\n\n    In the 2-line form, the elements and their final positions are shown\n    as a matrix with 2 rows:\n\n    [0    1    2     ... n-1]\n    [p(0) p(1) p(2)  ... p(n-1)]\n\n    Since the first line is always range(n), where n is the size of p,\n    it is sufficient to represent the permutation by the second line,\n    referred to as the \"array form\" of the permutation. This is entered\n    in brackets as the argument to the Permutation class:\n\n    >>> p = Permutation([0, 2, 1]); p\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1])\n\n    Given i in range(p.size), the permutation maps i to i^p\n\n    >>> [i^p for i in range(p.size)]\n    [0, 2, 1]\n\n    The composite of two permutations p*q means first apply p, then q, so\n    i^(p*q) = (i^p)^q which is i^p^q according to Python precedence rules:\n\n    >>> q = Permutation([2, 1, 0])\n    >>> [i^p^q for i in range(3)]\n    [2, 0, 1]\n    >>> [i^(p*q) for i in range(3)]\n    [2, 0, 1]\n\n    One can use also the notation p(i) = i^p, but then the composition\n    rule is (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)), not p(q(i)):\n\n    >>> [(p*q)(i) for i in range(p.size)]\n    [2, 0, 1]\n    >>> [q(p(i)) for i in range(p.size)]\n    [2, 0, 1]\n    >>> [p(q(i)) for i in range(p.size)]\n    [1, 2, 0]\n\n    Disjoint Cycle Notation\n    -----------------------\n\n    In disjoint cycle notation, only the elements that have shifted are\n    indicated. In the above case, the 2 and 1 switched places. This can\n    be entered in two ways:\n\n    >>> Permutation(1, 2) == Permutation([[1, 2]]) == p\n    True\n\n    Only the relative ordering of elements in a cycle matter:\n\n    >>> Permutation(1,2,3) == Permutation(2,3,1) == Permutation(3,1,2)\n    True\n\n    The disjoint cycle notation is convenient when representing\n    permutations that have several cycles in them:\n\n    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3, 5) == Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 5]])\n    True\n\n    It also provides some economy in entry when computing products of\n    permutations that are written in disjoint cycle notation:\n\n    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(1, 3)(2, 3)\n    Permutation([0, 3, 2, 1])\n    >>> _ == Permutation([[1, 2]])*Permutation([[1, 3]])*Permutation([[2, 3]])\n    True\n\n        Caution: when the cycles have common elements\n        between them then the order in which the\n        permutations are applied matters. The\n        convention is that the permutations are\n        applied from *right to left*. In the following, the\n        transposition of elements 2 and 3 is followed\n        by the transposition of elements 1 and 2:\n\n        >>> Permutation(1, 2)(2, 3) == Permutation([(1, 2), (2, 3)])\n        True\n        >>> Permutation(1, 2)(2, 3).list()\n        [0, 3, 1, 2]\n\n        If the first and second elements had been\n        swapped first, followed by the swapping of the second\n        and third, the result would have been [0, 2, 3, 1].\n        If, for some reason, you want to apply the cycles\n        in the order they are entered, you can simply reverse\n        the order of cycles:\n\n        >>> Permutation([(1, 2), (2, 3)][::-1]).list()\n        [0, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    Entering a singleton in a permutation is a way to indicate the size of the\n    permutation. The ``size`` keyword can also be used.\n\n    Array-form entry:\n\n    >>> Permutation([[1, 2], [9]])\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n    >>> Permutation([[1, 2]], size=10)\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n\n    Cyclic-form entry:\n\n    >>> Permutation(1, 2, size=10)\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n    >>> Permutation(9)(1, 2)\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n\n    Caution: no singleton containing an element larger than the largest\n    in any previous cycle can be entered. This is an important difference\n    in how Permutation and Cycle handle the __call__ syntax. A singleton\n    argument at the start of a Permutation performs instantiation of the\n    Permutation and is permitted:\n\n    >>> Permutation(5)\n    Permutation([], size=6)\n\n    A singleton entered after instantiation is a call to the permutation\n    -- a function call -- and if the argument is out of range it will\n    trigger an error. For this reason, it is better to start the cycle\n    with the singleton:\n\n    The following fails because there is no element 3:\n\n    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3)\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n    ...\n    IndexError: list index out of range\n\n    This is ok: only the call to an out of range singleton is prohibited;\n    otherwise the permutation autosizes:\n\n    >>> Permutation(3)(1, 2)\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1, 3])\n    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3, 4) == Permutation(3, 4)(1, 2)\n    True\n\n\n    Equality testing\n    ----------------\n\n    The array forms must be the same in order for permutations to be equal:\n\n    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3]) == Permutation([1, 0])\n    False\n\n\n    Identity Permutation\n    --------------------\n\n    The identity permutation is a permutation in which no element is out of\n    place. It can be entered in a variety of ways. All the following create\n    an identity permutation of size 4:\n\n    >>> I = Permutation([0, 1, 2, 3])\n    >>> all(p == I for p in [\n    ... Permutation(3),\n    ... Permutation(range(4)),\n    ... Permutation([], size=4),\n    ... Permutation(size=4)])\n    True\n\n    Watch out for entering the range *inside* a set of brackets (which is\n    cycle notation):\n\n    >>> I == Permutation([range(4)])\n    False\n\n\n    Permutation Printing\n    ====================\n\n    There are a few things to note about how Permutations are printed.\n\n    1) If you prefer one form (array or cycle) over another, you can set\n    ``init_printing`` with the ``perm_cyclic`` flag.\n\n    >>> from sympy import init_printing\n    >>> p = Permutation(1, 2)(4, 5)(3, 4)\n    >>> p\n    Permutation([0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3])\n\n    >>> init_printing(perm_cyclic=True, pretty_print=False)\n    >>> p\n    (1 2)(3 4 5)\n\n    2) Regardless of the setting, a list of elements in the array for cyclic\n    form can be obtained and either of those can be copied and supplied as\n    the argument to Permutation:\n\n    >>> p.array_form\n    [0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3]\n    >>> p.cyclic_form\n    [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]\n    >>> Permutation(_) == p\n    True\n\n    3) Printing is economical in that as little as possible is printed while\n    retaining all information about the size of the permutation:\n\n    >>> init_printing(perm_cyclic=False, pretty_print=False)\n    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n    Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3], size=20)\n    Permutation([1, 0], size=20)\n    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6], size=20)\n    Permutation([1, 0, 2, 4, 3], size=20)\n\n    >>> p = Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n    >>> init_printing(perm_cyclic=True, pretty_print=False)\n    >>> p\n    (3)(0 1)\n    >>> init_printing(perm_cyclic=False, pretty_print=False)\n\n    The 2 was not printed but it is still there as can be seen with the\n    array_form and size methods:\n\n    >>> p.array_form\n    [1, 0, 2, 3]\n    >>> p.size\n    4\n\n    Short introduction to other methods\n    ===================================\n\n    The permutation can act as a bijective function, telling what element is\n    located at a given position\n\n    >>> q = Permutation([5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0])\n    >>> q.array_form[1] # the hard way\n    2\n    >>> q(1) # the easy way\n    2\n    >>> {i: q(i) for i in range(q.size)} # showing the bijection\n    {0: 5, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 0}\n\n    The full cyclic form (including singletons) can be obtained:\n\n    >>> p.full_cyclic_form\n    [[0, 1], [2], [3]]\n\n    Any permutation can be factored into transpositions of pairs of elements:\n\n    >>> Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]).transpositions()\n    [(1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\n    >>> Permutation.rmul(*[Permutation([ti], size=6) for ti in _]).cyclic_form\n    [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]\n\n    The number of permutations on a set of n elements is given by n! and is\n    called the cardinality.\n\n    >>> p.size\n    4\n    >>> p.cardinality\n    24\n\n    A given permutation has a rank among all the possible permutations of the\n    same elements, but what that rank is depends on how the permutations are\n    enumerated. (There are a number of different methods of doing so.) The\n    lexicographic rank is given by the rank method and this rank is used to\n    increment a permutation with addition/subtraction:\n\n    >>> p.rank()\n    6\n    >>> p + 1\n    Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\n    >>> p.next_lex()\n    Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\n    >>> _.rank()\n    7\n    >>> p.unrank_lex(p.size, rank=7)\n    Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\n\n    The product of two permutations p and q is defined as their composition as\n    functions, (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)) [6]_.\n\n    >>> p = Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n    >>> q = Permutation([2, 3, 1, 0])\n    >>> list(q*p)\n    [2, 3, 0, 1]\n    >>> list(p*q)\n    [3, 2, 1, 0]\n    >>> [q(p(i)) for i in range(p.size)]\n    [3, 2, 1, 0]\n\n    The permutation can be 'applied' to any list-like object, not only\n    Permutations:\n\n    >>> p(['zero', 'one', 'four', 'two'])\n    ['one', 'zero', 'four', 'two']\n    >>> p('zo42')\n    ['o', 'z', '4', '2']\n\n    If you have a list of arbitrary elements, the corresponding permutation\n    can be found with the from_sequence method:\n\n    >>> Permutation.from_sequence('SymPy')\n    Permutation([1, 3, 2, 0, 4])\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    Cycle\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..

This group can be supplied\n    to Polyhedron if one desires to decorate the elements to which the\n    indices of the permutation refer.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics import Permutation\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Cycle\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.polyhedron import Polyhedron\n    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\n\n    The permutations corresponding to motion of the front, right and\n    bottom face of a 2x2 Rubik's cube are defined:\n\n    >>> F = Permutation(2, 19, 21, 8)(3, 17, 20, 10)(4, 6, 7, 5)\n    >>> R = Permutation(1, 5, 21, 14)(3, 7, 23, 12)(8, 10, 11, 9)\n    >>> D = Permutation(6, 18, 14, 10)(7, 19, 15, 11)(20, 22, 23, 21)\n\n    These are passed as permutations to PermutationGroup:\n\n    >>> G = PermutationGroup(F, R, D)\n    >>> G.order()\n    3674160\n\n    The group can be supplied to a Polyhedron in order to track the\n    objects being moved. An example involving the 2x2 Rubik's cube is\n    given there, but here is a simple demonstration:\n\n    >>> a = Permutation(2, 1)\n    >>> b = Permutation(1, 0)\n    >>> G = PermutationGroup(a, b)\n    >>> P = Polyhedron(list('ABC'), pgroup=G)\n    >>> P.corners\n    (A, B, C)\n    >>> P.rotate(0) # apply permutation 0\n    >>> P.corners\n    (A, C, B)\n    >>> P.reset()\n    >>> P.corners\n    (A, B, C)\n\n    Or one can make a permutation as a product of selected permutations\n    and apply them to an iterable directly:\n\n    >>> P10 = G.make_perm([0, 1])\n    >>> P10('ABC')\n    ['C', 'A', 'B']\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    sympy.combinatorics.polyhedron.Polyhedron,\n    sympy.combinatorics.permutations.Permutation\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..
