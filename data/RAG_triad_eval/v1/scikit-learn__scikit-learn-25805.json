    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use CalibratedClassifierCV to calibrate the probabilities from a LGBM model. The issue is that when I try CalibratedClassifierCV with eval_set, I get an error ValueError: Found input variables with inconsistent numbers of samples: [43364, 1] which is caused by check_consistent_length function in validation.py The input to eval set is [X_valid,Y_valid] where both X_valid,Y_valid are arrays with different shape. Since this format is a requirement for LGBM eval set https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pythonapi/lightgbm.LGBMClassifier.html, I am not sure how will I make the check_consistent_length pass in my scenario.

This probability\ngives you some kind of confidence on the prediction. However, not all\nclassifiers provide well-calibrated probabilities, some being over-confident\nwhile others being under-confident. Thus, a separate calibration of predicted\nprobabilities is often desirable as a postprocessing. This example illustrates\ntwo different methods for this calibration and evaluates the quality of the\nreturned probabilities using Brier's score\n(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score).\n\nCompared are the estimated probability using a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier\nwithout calibration, with a sigmoid calibration, and with a non-parametric\nisotonic calibration. One can observe that only the non-parametric model is\nable to provide a probability calibration that returns probabilities close\nto the expected 0.5 for most of the samples belonging to the middle\ncluster with heterogeneous labels. This results in a significantly improved\nBrier score.\n\n\"\"\"\n# Authors:\n# Mathieu Blondel <mathieu@mblondel.org>\n# Alexandre Gramfort <alexandre.gramfort@telecom-paristech.fr>\n# Balazs Kegl <balazs.kegl@gmail.com>\n# Jan Hendrik Metzen <jhm@informatik.uni-bremen.de>\n# License: BSD Style.\n\n# %%\n# Generate synthetic dataset\n# --------------------------\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nn_samples = 50000\nn_bins = 3  # use 3 bins for calibration_curve as we have 3 clusters here\n\n# Generate 3 blobs with 2 classes where the second blob contains\n# half positive samples and half negative samples.

This probability gives some\nkind of confidence on the prediction. This example demonstrates how to\nvisualize how well calibrated the predicted probabilities are using calibration\ncurves, also known as reliability diagrams. Calibration of an uncalibrated\nclassifier will also be demonstrated.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Author: Alexandre Gramfort <alexandre.gramfort@telecom-paristech.fr>\n#         Jan Hendrik Metzen <jhm@informatik.uni-bremen.de>\n# License: BSD 3 clause.\n# %%\n# Dataset\n# -------\n#\n# We will use a synthetic binary classification dataset with 100,000 samples\n# and 20 features.

            "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides several actionable suggestions that are relevant to the described issue. It correctly identifies the need to ensure that `X_valid` and `Y_valid` are of the same length, which is a common source of the error mentioned in the PROMPT. The advice to check the spelling and usage of `fit_params` is valid, although the error message does not suggest a typo as the cause. The RESPONSE also correctly advises to pass `fit_params` as `**fit_params` to expand the dictionary into keyword arguments, which is necessary for the `fit` method to receive the parameters correctly. The suggestion to verify the shapes of `X_train`, `Y_train`, `X_valid`, and `Y_valid` is a good debugging step to ensure that the data is correctly formatted before fitting. Lastly, the RESPONSE advises checking for any data preprocessing steps that might lead to a mismatch in the number of samples, which is a reasonable suggestion. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific interaction between CalibratedClassifierCV and LGBMClassifier's `eval_set` requirement, which is the core of the issue. The code snippets provided are somewhat relevant but do not directly address the problem of using `eval_set` with CalibratedClassifierCV.",
