    "title": "Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nAs pointed out by \u200bHaki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the requested feature, you need to add logging for exceptions raised in receivers when `Signal.send_robust()` is called. Here's how you can do it:\n\n- Import the logging module at the top of `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`.\n- Define a logger for the dispatcher module.\n- Add a logging call in the exception handling block of the `send_robust` and `asend_robust` methods.\n\nHere's the code snippet to implement the feature:\n\n```python\n# At the top of django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\nimport logging\n\n# Define a logger for the dispatcher module\nlogger = logging.getLogger('django.dispatch')\n\n# Inside the Signal class, modify the _log_robust_failure method\ndef _log_robust_failure(self, receiver, exc):\n    # Log the error with the exception information\n    logger.exception(\"Exception raised in receiver %r: %s\", receiver, exc)\n\n# Ensure that _log_robust_failure is called in the exception blocks of send_robust and asend_robust methods\n```\n\nMake sure that the `_log_robust_failure` method is called wherever an exception is caught in the `send_robust` and `asend_robust` methods. This will ensure that all exceptions raised by receivers are logged.\n\nFor further research, you may want to look into the following:\n\n- Python's `logging` module documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html\n- Django's logging configuration: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/logging/\n\nThis implementation will allow users to see exceptions from `Signal.send_robust()` in their error handling tools like Sentry.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [dispatch](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/dispatch)- [Lines 269 - 400](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/dispatch/dispatcher.py#L269-L400)\n\n This snippet contains the send_robust method where the logging of exceptions should be added as per the issue description. \n\n\n   - [Lines 332 - 410](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/dispatch/dispatcher.py#L332-L410)\n\n This snippet contains the asend_robust method which is the asynchronous counterpart to send_robust and should also include logging for exceptions.",
