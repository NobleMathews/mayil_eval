    "title": "Detection of existing total ordering in admin changelist should take into account UniqueConstraints without conditions.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nI've been fiddling with db indexes lately to improve the performance of an admin view.\nEventually I found this PR \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/10692 which ensures the records displayed by ChangeList are deterministically ordered.\nAmong other things, the code looks for the presence of a unique_together attribute on the Meta class of the model to determine if the model is already totally ordered.\nI think that _get_deterministic_ordering() should check for the presence of UniqueConstraints as well, which currently aren\u2019t considered by the discovery algorithm.\nI noticed the docs currently advise against using unique_together in favor of UniqueConstraint, suggesting the former may be deprecated in the future, so this fix would change that part of the code accordingly.\nI'm willing to submit a PR for this.\nCheers,\nFabio\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature requested in the ticket, you will need to modify the `_get_deterministic_ordering` method in `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` to consider `UniqueConstraint` objects without conditions as part of the total ordering check. Here's how you can do it:\n\n- Modify the `else` block that checks for `unique_together` and `total_unique_constraints` to also consider `UniqueConstraint` objects without conditions.\n- Use the `total_unique_constraints` property from `django/db/models/options.py` which already filters out constraints with conditions and expressions.\n- Ensure that the `UniqueConstraint` objects are considered when checking for a deterministic ordering.\n\nHere's the modified code snippet for `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py`:\n\n```python\n# ... existing code ...\n\nelse:\n    # No single total ordering field, try unique_together, total\n    # unique constraints, and UniqueConstraint without conditions.\n    constraint_field_names = (\n        *self.lookup_opts.unique_together,\n        *(\n            constraint.fields\n            for constraint in self.lookup_opts.total_unique_constraints\n        ),\n        *(\n            constraint.fields\n            for constraint in self.lookup_opts.constraints\n            if isinstance(constraint, UniqueConstraint) and constraint.condition is None\n        ),\n    )\n    for field_names in constraint_field_names:\n        # Normalize attname references by using get_field().\n        fields = [\n            self.lookup_opts.get_field(field_name) for field_name in field_names\n        ]\n        # Composite unique constraints containing a nullable column\n        # cannot ensure total ordering.\n        if any(field.null for field in fields):\n            continue\n        if ordering_fields.issuperset(field.attname for field in fields):\n            break\n    else:\n        # If no set of unique fields is present in the ordering, rely\n        # on the primary key to provide total ordering.\n        ordering.append(\"-pk\")\nreturn ordering\n\n# ... existing code ...\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that `UniqueConstraint` objects without conditions are considered when determining if the model has a total ordering defined. If such constraints are found, they are used to guarantee a deterministic ordering in the admin changelist view.\n\nRemember to add appropriate unit tests to cover this new functionality and ensure that existing tests pass. This will help validate the correctness of the implementation and prevent regressions in the future.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [admin](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/contrib/admin) \u2192 [views](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/contrib/admin/views)- [Lines 426 - 529](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/contrib/admin/views/main.py#L426-L529)\n\n This snippet contains the _get_deterministic_ordering method which is responsible for ensuring a deterministic order in the admin changelist. The issue describes a need to consider UniqueConstraints in this method, which is currently not done. Modifying this snippet is necessary to address the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 442 - 1007](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/options.py#L442-L1007)\n\n This snippet defines the total_unique_constraints property in the options.py file, which is used by the _get_deterministic_ordering method to determine if a model has a total unique constraint. It is relevant because the issue suggests that UniqueConstraints without conditions should be considered, and this property is likely where the change needs to be made.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 66 - 372](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/constraints.py#L66-L372)\n\n This snippet from constraints.py defines the UniqueConstraint class, including its properties and methods. Understanding how UniqueConstraints are defined and used is necessary to properly integrate them into the _get_deterministic_ordering method as described in the issue.",
