    "mayil_response": "- The issue is with the `core_distances_` attribute in the `OPTICS` class, which should contain `inf` for points that will never be core, but it does not.\n- The relevant code snippet is from `sklearn/cluster/_optics.py` where the `_compute_core_distances_` function is defined and used.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n- Ensure that the `max_eps` parameter is correctly set to `np.inf` or a sufficiently large value to avoid prematurely cutting off the distance calculation.\n- Check the `_compute_core_distances_` function to ensure that it correctly assigns `np.inf` to points that will never be core points.\n- If `max_eps` is set to a value other than `np.inf`, ensure that the line `core_distances_[core_distances_ > max_eps] = np.inf` is correctly setting distances greater than `max_eps` to `np.inf`.\n- If the issue persists, consider adding a check after the core distances are computed to set the distance to `np.inf` for points that do not have the minimum number of neighbors within `max_eps` distance. This can be done by checking the count of neighbors within `max_eps` for each point and setting the core distance to `np.inf` if the count is less than `min_samples`.\n- Ensure that the `core_distances_` array is correctly returned from the `_compute_core_distances_` function and that it is correctly used in the `fit` method of the `OPTICS` class.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [cluster](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/cluster)- [Lines 423 - 635](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L423-L635)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for setting reachability_ to inf, which is relevant to the issue of core distances not being set to inf as per the documentation. \n\n\n   - [Lines 391 - 433](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L391-L433)\n\n This snippet defines the _compute_core_distances_ function, which is responsible for computing the core distances and may contain the logic that needs to be corrected to ensure points that will never be core have a distance of inf. \n\n\n   - [Lines 456 - 1101](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L456-L1101)\n\n This snippet contains the documentation of the compute_optics_graph function, which mentions that points which will never be core have a distance of inf, aligning with the issue description. \n\n\n   - [Lines 36 - 1101](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L36-L1101)\n\n This snippet includes the documentation for the OPTICS class, which may need to be updated if the behavior of core_distances_ is changed to match the R implementation.",

Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable\n    neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large datasets than the\n    current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.\n\n    Clusters are then extracted using a DBSCAN-like method\n    (cluster_method = 'dbscan') or an automatic\n    technique proposed in [1]_ (cluster_method = 'xi').\n\n    This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing\n    k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then\n    computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the\n    cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion\n    candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <optics>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    min_samples : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=5\n        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as\n        a core point. Also, up and down steep regions can't have more than\n        ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep points. Expressed as an absolute\n        number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least\n        2).\n\n    max_eps : float, default=np.inf\n        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n        in the neighborhood of the other. Default value of ``np.inf`` will\n        identify clusters across all scales; reducing ``max_eps`` will result\n        in shorter run times.\n\n    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'\n        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn\n        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.\n\n        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each\n        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable\n        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the\n        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less\n        efficient than passing the metric name as a string. If metric is\n        \"precomputed\", `X` is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be\n        square.\n\n        Valid values for metric are:\n\n        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',\n          'manhattan']\n\n        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',\n          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',\n          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',\n          'yule']\n\n        Sparse matrices are only supported by scikit-learn metrics.\n        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n        metrics.\n\n        .. note::\n           `'kulsinski'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will removed in SciPy 1.11.\n\n    p : float, default=2\n        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from\n        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is\n        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance\n        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.\n\n    metric_params : dict, default=None\n        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.\n\n    cluster_method : str, default='xi'\n        The extraction method used to extract clusters using the calculated\n        reachability and ordering. Possible values are \"xi\" and \"dbscan\".\n\n    eps : float, default=None\n        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n        in the neighborhood of the other. By default it assumes the same value\n        as ``max_eps``.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='dbscan'``.\n\n    xi : float between 0 and 1, default=0.05\n        Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that\n        constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the\n        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its\n        successor being at most 1-xi.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    predecessor_correction : bool, default=True\n        Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS\n        [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None\n        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an\n        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be\n        at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'\n        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:\n\n        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.\n        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`.\n        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.\n        - 'auto' (default) will attempt to decide the most appropriate\n          algorithm based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.\n\n        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of\n        this parameter, using brute force.\n\n    leaf_size : int, default=30\n        Leaf size passed to :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` or\n        :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`. This can affect the speed of the\n        construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the\n        tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.\n\n    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None\n        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.\n        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the\n        path to the caching directory.\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.\n        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.\n        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().\n        Noisy samples and points which are not included in a leaf cluster\n        of ``cluster_hierarchy_`` are labeled as -1.\n\n    reachability_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use\n        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    ordering_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.\n\n    core_distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object\n        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use\n        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    predecessor_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.\n        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.\n\n    cluster_hierarchy_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)\n        The list of clusters in the form of ``[start, end]`` in each row, with\n        all indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to\n        ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing\n        smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does\n        not reflect the hierarchy, usually\n        ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also\n        note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.\n        ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.\n        Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    n_features_in_ : int\n        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\n    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`.

For example, an upwards point in the\n        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its\n        successor being at most 1-xi.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    predecessor_correction : bool, default=True\n        Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS\n        [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None\n        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an\n        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be\n        at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'\n        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:\n\n        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.\n        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`.\n        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.\n        - 'auto' (default) will attempt to decide the most appropriate\n          algorithm based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.\n\n        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of\n        this parameter, using brute force.\n\n    leaf_size : int, default=30\n        Leaf size passed to :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` or\n        :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`. This can affect the speed of the\n        construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the\n        tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.\n\n    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None\n        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.\n        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the\n        path to the caching directory.\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.\n        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.\n        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().\n        Noisy samples and points which are not included in a leaf cluster\n        of ``cluster_hierarchy_`` are labeled as -1.\n\n    reachability_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use\n        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    ordering_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.\n\n    core_distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object\n        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use\n        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    predecessor_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.\n        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.\n\n    cluster_hierarchy_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)\n        The list of clusters in the form of ``[start, end]`` in each row, with\n        all indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to\n        ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing\n        smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does\n        not reflect the hierarchy, usually\n        ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also\n        note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.\n        ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.\n        Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    n_features_in_ : int\n        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\n    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`\n        has feature names that are all strings.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 1.0\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    DBSCAN : A similar clustering for a specified neighborhood radius (eps).\n        Our implementation is optimized for runtime.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
