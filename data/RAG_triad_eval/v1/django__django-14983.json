    "body": "Description\n\t\nWhen an app has migrations 0001_initial and 0002_auto_20141202_1234 that are squashed to 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234, a new call to makemigrations will generate a migration file called 0002_auto_20141202_2345 instead of 0003_auto_20141202_2345 which is quite irritating as long as 0002_auto_20141202_1234 is still around. It does make sense though when only 0001_squashed_0002_auto_20141202_1234 is left.\nAlthough the latter case eventually hits every project, I'd prefer the former.\n",
