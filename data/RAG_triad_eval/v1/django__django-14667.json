    "body": "Description\n\t\nConsidering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example: \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand \nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n",

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude10.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nBased on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the unexpected SQL query generated when chaining `QuerySet.defer()` and `QuerySet.only()` methods together on the `Company` model. The expected behavior is not clearly stated, but typically, `only()` should load only the specified fields, and `defer()` should defer the loading of specified fields until they are accessed.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `only()` method is called with the correct field names that need to be loaded immediately.\n- Ensure that the `defer()` method is called with the correct field names that should be deferred.\n- Avoid using `defer()` for fields that are already specified in `only()`, as this is redundant and may lead to unexpected behavior.\n- If the intention is to defer all fields except some, use `only()` with the fields that should not be deferred, and do not chain it with `defer()`.\n- If the intention is to defer specific fields, use `defer()` with the fields that should be deferred, and do not chain it with `only()` unless you are deferring fields not specified in `only()`.\n\nFor example, if the expected behavior is to load only the `name` field and defer the `country` field, the correct query would be:\n\n```python\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\n```\n\nIf the expected behavior is to load only the `name` and `country` fields, and defer all others, the correct query would be:\n\n```python\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\")\n```\n\nIf the expected behavior is to defer the `trade_number` field and load all others, the correct query would be:\n\n```python\nCompany.objects.defer(\"trade_number\")\n```\n\nReview the SQL query structure to ensure that the generated SQL matches the expected behavior based on the use of `only()` and `defer()`. If the SQL does not match, there may be a bug in the implementation of these methods or in how they are being used.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1728 - 1789](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1728-L1789)\n\n The 'only' method is directly related to the issue as it is part of the chain that is not working as expected.
