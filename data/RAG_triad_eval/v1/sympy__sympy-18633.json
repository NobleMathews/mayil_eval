    "mayil_response": "- Review the random number generation in `test_tensor_partial_deriv` to ensure it does not produce a zero value which might be causing the test to fail intermittently.\n- If the test relies on non-zero values, add a check to regenerate the random value if it is zero, or adjust the range of the random number generator to exclude zero.\n- Ensure that `PartialDerivative` function can handle zero values appropriately if they are a valid input for the function. If not, the function should raise an appropriate error when a zero value is passed.\n- If the issue is specifically with the derivative being zero, modify the test to handle or avoid this edge case.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [tensor](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/tensor)- [Lines 7 - 7](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/tensor/toperators.py#L7-L7)\n\n The issue is related to the PartialDerivative class, and this snippet defines that class. It may need to be examined or modified to handle the case when the random value is zero.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 796 - 3961](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/core/expr.py#L796-L3961)\n\n This snippet contains logic for simplifying expressions and handling cases when the difference is a number. It may be relevant to understand how zero values are treated in expressions and if there's a need to adjust the logic for the PartialDerivative case.",
