However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the specific issue of the different results between `Rational('0.5', '100')` and `Rational(0.5, 100)` or the discrepancy between Sympy versions 1.8 and 1.11.1. Instead, it provides a general approach to debugging and testing without specific reference to the user's problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes code snippets and links that are not directly related to the user's issue, as they reference a non-existent version of Sympy (1.12) and a hypothetical GitHub repository.
