The two queries are the same !!!\\n')\noutput\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\")\nQUERY 2: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\nQUERY 1: SELECT \"foobar_modelc\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\", \"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\", \"foobar_modela\".\"id\", \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\" FROM \"foobar_modelc\" INNER JOIN \"foobar_modela\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_a_id\" = \"foobar_modela\".\"id\") INNER JOIN \"foobar_modelb\" ON (\"foobar_modelc\".\"model_b_id\" = \"foobar_modelb\".\"id\")\n!!! The two queries are the same !!!\nThe expectation is that the original QuerySet is not mutated, and the two queries are different. This behavior also happens with 'prefetch_related'.\nSince the QuerySet methods call 'self._clone()', and state that they return 'a new QuerySet instance', this behavior does not seem correct.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be that the `select_related` and `prefetch_related` methods are mutating the original QuerySet instead of returning a new instance as expected. The relevant code snippet from `django/db/models/query.py` shows the implementation of these methods.\n\nTo solve the issue:\n\n- Ensure that `self._chain()` is correctly implemented to return a new QuerySet instance rather than mutating the existing one.\n- Verify that `self._chain()` uses `self._clone()` to create a new QuerySet instance.\n- If `self._chain()` is not using `self._clone()`, update the `self._chain()` method to use `self._clone()` to ensure a new QuerySet instance is returned.\n\nHere is a concise solution:\n\n- In the `select_related` method, replace `obj = self._chain()` with `obj = self._clone()` if `_chain` is not already creating a proper clone.\n- In the `prefetch_related` method, replace `clone = self._chain()` with `clone = self._clone()` if `_chain` is not already creating a proper clone.\n- Ensure that `_clone` method is correctly implemented to create a deep copy of the QuerySet, including its query attribute, so that changes to `obj.query` or `clone.query` do not affect the original QuerySet's `query` attribute.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1530 - 1601](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1530-L1601)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation of 'select_related' which is directly related to the issue. The method is supposed to return a new QuerySet instance without mutating the original, but the issue suggests that it is mutating the original QuerySet. Therefore, changes to this method may be required to fix the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 79 - 1189](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L79-L1189)\n\n This snippet includes the logic for filling in information for a select_related query and may contain clues about how the QuerySet is being cloned and if the mutation of the original QuerySet is happening during this process. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1143 - 2027](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L1143-L2027)\n\n This snippet defines the 'get_related_selections' method which is used by 'select_related' to handle the selection of related objects. It could be involved in the mutation of the original QuerySet and is relevant to understanding the issue.",
