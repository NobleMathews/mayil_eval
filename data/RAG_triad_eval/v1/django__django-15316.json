    "mayil_response": "- Identify the `simplify_regex` function within the `django/utils/regex_helper.py` file.\n- Modify the `simplify_regex` function to correctly handle non-capturing groups by ensuring that when a non-capturing group is encountered (indicated by `(?:`), it is treated appropriately.\n- Ensure that non-capturing groups are not converted into capturing groups during the simplification process.\n- If the `simplify_regex` function does not exist, create it based on the hypothesized documentation provided, and implement the correct handling of non-capturing groups within it.\n- If the function already exists but does not handle non-capturing groups correctly, update the logic to do so. This may involve checking for the `(?:` pattern and ensuring that it is preserved in the simplified regex pattern returned by the function.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [utils](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/utils)- [Lines 1 - 38](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/utils/regex_helper.py#L1-L38)\n\n This snippet defines the NonCapture class, which is likely relevant to the issue of non-capturing groups not being handled correctly by simplify_regex(). \n\n\n   - [Lines 42 - 190](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/utils/regex_helper.py#L42-L190)\n\n This snippet contains logic for handling different types of groups in regex patterns, which may need to be modified to correctly handle non-capturing groups. \n\n\n   - [Lines 109 - 156](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/utils/regex_helper.py#L109-L156)\n\n This snippet includes the logic for handling non-capturing groups in regex patterns, which is directly related to the issue.",

It provides a detailed step-by-step approach to identifying and modifying the function within the Django framework to handle non-capturing groups correctly. The RESPONSE also includes references to specific code snippets that are likely relevant to the issue, showing a direct connection to the problem described in the PROMPT.
