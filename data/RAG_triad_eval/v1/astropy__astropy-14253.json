    "title": "When should `info` be linked to a new object?",
    "body": "Mostly for @taldcroft - I noticed that in `Quantity` the way we have set up `__array_finalize__`, `info` is passed on not just for views (where it should be), but also for copies (implicitly in arithmetic operations, etc.). Which ones are reasonable?  Just thinking about whether, e.g., `info.name` should be propagated, I'd think:\n- Surely for\n  - views & reshapes: `q[...]`, `q.squeeze`, etc.\n  - insertions: `q.insert(...)`\n- Probably for\n  - selection of scalars: `q[0]` or in `for q1 in q:` (for columns this returns a scalar without `info`)\n  - copies: `q.copy()` and equivalents\n  - equivalent unit changes: `q.to(...)`, `q.si`, `q.decompose()`, etc.\n- Probably not for\n  - operations `q3 = q1 + q2`\n  - real unit changes `q * unit` (including in-place??; `q /= u.m`)\n\nWhat do you think?\n\np.s. Currently, all of the above happen, in part because I use `__array_finalize__` in `Quantity._new_view`, something which I don't think we had really considered when we made the change in `__array_finalize__`. But that also means that in principle it may not too hard to fairly finely define the behaviour.\n\n",
