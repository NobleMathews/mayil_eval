    "body": "#### Description\r\nIsolation forest consumes too much memory due to memory ineffecient implementation of anomoly score calculation. Due to this the parallelization with n_jobs is also impacted as anomoly score cannot be calculated in parallel for each tree.\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\nRun a simple Isolation forest with n_estimators as 10 and as 50 respectively.\r\nOn memory profiling, it can be seen that each building of tree is not taking much memory but in the end a lot of memory is consumed as a for loop is iteration over all trees and calculating the anomoly score of all trees together and then averaging it.\r\n-iforest.py line 267-281\r\n```py\r\n        for i, (tree, features) in enumerate(zip(self.estimators_,\r\n                                                 self.estimators_features_)):\r\n            if subsample_features:\r\n                X_subset = X[:, features]\r\n            else:\r\n                X_subset = X\r\n            leaves_index = tree.apply(X_subset)\r\n            node_indicator = tree.decision_path(X_subset)\r\n            n_samples_leaf[:, i] = tree.tree_.n_node_samples[leaves_index]\r\n            depths[:, i] = np.ravel(node_indicator.sum(axis=1))\r\n            depths[:, i] -= 1\r\n\r\n        depths += _average_path_length(n_samples_leaf)\r\n\r\n        scores = 2 ** (-depths.mean(axis=1) / _average_path_length(self.max_samples_))\r\n\r\n        # Take the opposite of the scores as bigger is better (here less\r\n        # abnormal) and add 0.5 (this value plays a special role as described\r\n        # in the original paper) to give a sense to scores = 0:\r\n        return 0.5 - scores\r\n````\r\n\r\nDue to this, in case of more no. of estimators(1000), the memory consumed is quite high.\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\nPossible Solution:\r\nThe above for loop should only do the averaging of anomoly score from each estimator instead of calculation. The logic of isoforest anomoly score calculation can be moved to base estimator class so it is done for each tree( i guess bagging.py file-similar to other method available after fitting)\r\n#### Actual Results\r\nThe memory consumption is profound as we increase no. of estimators.\r\n```py\r\nmodel=Isolationforest()\r\nmodel.fit(data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fit method calls decision function & average anomoly score which are taking quite a lot memory.\r\nthe memory spike is too high in the very end, that is in finall call to `average_path_length()` method.\r\n```\r\ndepths += _average_path_length(n_samples_leaf)\r\n```\r\n#### Versions\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for contributing! -->\r\n\r\n[isoForest_memoryConsumption.docx](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/files/2363437/isoForest_memoryConsumption.docx)\r\n\r\n\n",

Used when fitting to define the threshold\n        on the scores of the samples.\n\n            - If 'auto', the threshold is determined as in the\n              original paper.\n            - If float, the contamination should be in the range (0, 0.5].\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n           The default value of ``contamination`` changed from 0.1\n           to ``'auto'``.\n\n    max_features : int or float, default=1.0\n        The number of features to draw from X to train each base estimator.\n\n            - If int, then draw `max_features` features.\n            - If float, then draw `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features.\n\n        Note: using a float number less than 1.0 or integer less than number of\n        features will enable feature subsampling and leads to a longer runtime.\n\n    bootstrap : bool, default=False\n        If True, individual trees are fit on random subsets of the training\n        data sampled with replacement. If False, sampling without replacement\n        is performed.\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        The number of jobs to run in parallel for both :meth:`fit` and\n        :meth:`predict`. ``None`` means 1 unless in a\n        :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context. ``-1`` means using all\n        processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>` for more details.\n\n    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None\n        Controls the pseudo-randomness of the selection of the feature\n        and split values for each branching step and each tree in the forest.\n\n        Pass an int for reproducible results across multiple function calls.\n        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.\n\n    verbose : int, default=0\n        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.\n\n    warm_start : bool, default=False\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\n        new forest.

We\n        have the relation: ``decision_function = score_samples - offset_``.\n        ``offset_`` is defined as follows. When the contamination parameter is\n        set to \"auto\", the offset is equal to -0.5 as the scores of inliers are\n        close to 0 and the scores of outliers are close to -1. When a\n        contamination parameter different than \"auto\" is provided, the offset\n        is defined in such a way we obtain the expected number of outliers\n        (samples with decision function < 0) in training.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.20\n\n    n_features_in_ : int\n        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\n    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`\n        has feature names that are all strings.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 1.0\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    sklearn.covariance.EllipticEnvelope : An object for detecting outliers in a\n        Gaussian distributed dataset.\n    sklearn.svm.OneClassSVM : Unsupervised Outlier Detection.\n        Estimate the support of a high-dimensional distribution.\n        The implementation is based on libsvm.\n    sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor : Unsupervised Outlier Detection\n        using Local Outlier Factor (LOF).\n\n    Notes\n    -----\n    The implementation is based on an ensemble of ExtraTreeRegressor. The\n    maximum depth of each tree is set to ``ceil(log_2(n))`` where\n    :math:`n` is the number of samples used to build the tree\n    (see (Liu et al., 2008) for more details).\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..
