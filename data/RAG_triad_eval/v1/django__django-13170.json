    "mayil_response": "To implement support for nested relations in `FilteredRelation`'s condition, you will need to modify the Django ORM's internal query construction mechanisms to allow for the resolution of nested relations within the `FilteredRelation` object. This is a non-trivial change that requires a deep understanding of Django's ORM internals.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the steps you might take to implement this feature:\n\n- Modify the `add_filtered_relation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to remove the restriction that raises a `ValueError` when nested relations are detected. This involves changing the logic that checks for nested relations and raises exceptions accordingly.\n- Update the `FilteredRelation` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` to handle nested conditions. This might involve recursively resolving conditions for each level of nesting.\n- Ensure that the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` can build the correct SQL JOINs for nested relations. This will likely involve updating the `build_filter` and `setup_joins` methods to handle nested relations properly.\n- Update the `get_path_info` and related methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to return the correct `PathInfo` objects for nested relations.\n- Add comprehensive tests to cover the new functionality and ensure that existing functionality is not broken.\n\nHere is a simplified pseudo-code example of how you might begin to modify the `add_filtered_relation` method:\n\n```python\ndef add_filtered_relation(self, filtered_relation, alias):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # Remove the check that raises ValueError for nested relations\n    # for lookup in chain(lookups):\n    #     ... existing code ...\n\n    # Instead, handle nested relations\n    for lookup in chain(lookups):\n        # Resolve nested relations here\n        # This will involve recursively processing each part of the lookup\n        # and ensuring that the correct JOINs are constructed in the SQL query\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a complex feature to implement and would require careful consideration of how nested relations interact with other parts of the ORM, such as filtering, exclusion, and selecting related objects. It would also require a thorough understanding of SQL JOINs and how Django constructs queries.\n\nGiven the complexity of this task, it is recommended to engage with the Django community, possibly through the django-developers mailing list or contributing to the Django project on GitHub, to discuss the best approach to implementing this feature. It may also be beneficial to look into how other ORMs handle nested relations for inspiration.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 1614 - 1648](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1614-L1648)\n\n This snippet contains the logic that raises the ValueError when nested relations are used in FilteredRelation's condition, which is directly related to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 396 - 446](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/query_utils.py#L396-L446)\n\n This snippet defines the FilteredRelation class and its methods, which are relevant to the issue as the condition attribute and its handling are part of the problem.",

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",

This involves changing the logic that checks for nested relations and raises exceptions accordingly.\n- Update the `FilteredRelation` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` to handle nested conditions. This might involve recursively resolving conditions for each level of nesting.\n- Ensure that the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` can build the correct SQL JOINs for nested relations. This will likely involve updating the `build_filter` and `setup_joins` methods to handle nested relations properly.\n- Update the `get_path_info` and related methods in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to return the correct `PathInfo` objects for nested relations.\n- Add comprehensive tests to cover the new functionality and ensure that existing functionality is not broken.\n\nHere is a simplified pseudo-code example of how you might begin to modify the `add_filtered_relation` method:\n\n```python\ndef add_filtered_relation(self, filtered_relation, alias):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # Remove the check that raises ValueError for nested relations\n    # for lookup in chain(lookups):\n    #     ... existing code ...\n\n    # Instead, handle nested relations\n    for lookup in chain(lookups):\n        # Resolve nested relations here\n        # This will involve recursively processing each part of the lookup\n        # and ensuring that the correct JOINs are constructed in the SQL query\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a complex feature to implement and would require careful consideration of how nested relations interact with other parts of the ORM, such as filtering, exclusion, and selecting related objects.
