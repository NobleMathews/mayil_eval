    "title": "Aggregation over subquery annotation GROUP BY produces wrong results",
    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Christian Klus)\n\t \nStarting in django 3.0.7, specifically after patch #31566 I noticed some of my more complex queries returning incorrect results. I think I've narrowed it down to a simpler test case:\nExample query:\nBook.objects.all().annotate(\n\tpub_year=TruncYear('pubdate')\n).order_by().values('pub_year').annotate(\n\ttotal_pages=Sum('pages'),\n\ttop_rating=Subquery(\n\t\tBook.objects.filter(\n\t\t\tpubdate__year=OuterRef('pub_year')\n\t\t).order_by('rating').values('rating')[:1]\n\t)\n).values('pub_year', 'total_pages', 'top_rating')\nGenerated SQL on 3.0.6:\nSELECT\n django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\") AS \"pub_year\",\n SUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n (\n\tSELECT U0.\"rating\"\n\tFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\n\tWHERE\n\t django_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\")\n\tORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n ) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\n django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\"),\n \"top_rating\"\nGenerated SQL on current master:\nSELECT\n django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL) AS \"pub_year\",\n SUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n (\n\tSELECT U0.\"rating\"\n\tFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\n\tWHERE\n\t django_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\n\tORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n ) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\n django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL),\n (\n\tSELECT U0.\"rating\"\n\tFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\n\tWHERE\n\t django_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\n\tORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n ),\n \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\"\nI see two separate issues here:\n\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\" is being added to the group by clause incorrectly (this issue probably predates the patch mentioned above)\nEven though the subquery is in the select statement, the alias is not being used and instead the subquery is reevaluated. This nearly doubles the cost of one of my queries that is experiencing this problem.\nI don't know much about the ORM internals, but here is my naive patch for the second issue:\ndiff --git a/django/db/models/sql/query.py b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\nindex ee98984826..6ea287d6cb 100644\n--- a/django/db/models/sql/query.py\n+++ b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\n@@ -2220,7 +2220,7 @@ class Query(BaseExpression):\n\t\t\t # the selected fields anymore.\n\t\t\t group_by = []\n\t\t\t for expr in self.group_by:\n-\t\t\t\tif isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names:\n+\t\t\t\tif isinstance(expr, Ref) and expr.refs not in field_names + annotation_names:\n\t\t\t\t\t expr = self.annotations[expr.refs]\n\t\t\t\t group_by.append(expr)\n\t\t\t self.group_by = tuple(group_by)\nI'd appreciate anyone with deeper knowlege of the ORM to chime in and let me know if I'm on the right track. Tests are passing locally.\nThe resulting query on master:\nSELECT\n django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL) AS \"pub_year\",\n SUM(\"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pages\") AS \"total_pages\",\n (\n\tSELECT U0.\"rating\"\n\tFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\" U0\n\tWHERE\n\t django_date_extract('year', U0.\"pubdate\") = django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL)\n\tORDER BY U0.\"rating\" ASC LIMIT 1\n ) AS \"top_rating\"\nFROM \"aggregation_regress_book\"\nGROUP BY\n django_date_trunc('year', \"aggregation_regress_book\".\"pubdate\", NULL, NULL),\n \"top_rating\"\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of GROUP BY clauses in complex Django ORM queries, particularly when subqueries and annotations are involved. The issue likely arises from changes introduced in patch #31566, which may have altered the behavior of the `Query` class's `group_by` logic.\n\nTo address the issue, consider the following solution:\n\n- Review the proposed patch diff for `django/db/models/sql/query.py` provided by the user. The patch should aim to correct the `group_by` logic to ensure that the correct fields are included in the GROUP BY clause when complex queries with subquery annotations are executed.\n- Ensure that the `group_by` attribute of the `Query` class is correctly set when the query involves subqueries, annotations, and functions like `TruncYear`, `Sum`, `Subquery`, and `OuterRef`.\n- Verify that the `Query` class's methods such as `get_group_by_cols`, `resolve_expression`, and any other methods that manipulate the GROUP BY clause are correctly handling expressions and references, especially when aliases are used.\n- Test the changes with the example query provided (`Book.objects.all().annotate().order_by().values().annotate().values()`) and compare the generated SQL against the expected correct SQL.\n- Ensure that the changes do not introduce regressions for other types of queries, particularly those that do not involve complex GROUP BY logic.\n- Once the patch is confirmed to resolve the issue, it should be submitted for inclusion in the Django codebase, following the project's contribution guidelines.\n\nRemember to test the solution thoroughly with different types of complex queries to ensure that the GROUP BY clause is generated correctly in all cases.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 509 - 2560](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L509-L2560)\n\n This snippet deals with the handling of annotations and aggregates in subqueries, which is relevant to the issue of incorrect GROUP BY behavior in complex queries. \n\n\n   - [Lines 467 - 508](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L467-L508)\n\n This snippet is part of the logic that handles the creation of inner and outer queries for aggregation, which is directly related to the issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1160 - 1220](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1160-L1220)\n\n This snippet includes the resolve_expression method which is involved in resolving expressions for subqueries, which could be related to the GROUP BY clause issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 72 - 553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L72-L553)\n\n This snippet shows how annotations are inlined and masked, which could be relevant to the issue if the GROUP BY clause is incorrectly including fields due to annotation handling. \n\n\n   - [Lines 457 - 2668](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L457-L2668)\n\n This snippet contains conditions that determine when a GROUP BY clause is necessary, which could be relevant to the issue if the logic is incorrectly causing the GROUP BY clause to include unwanted fields.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet is part of the GROUP BY clause construction in SQL queries, which is central to the issue being reported. \n\n\n   - [Lines 630 - 691](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L630-L691)\n\n This snippet is involved in the handling of window function references and aliasing in subqueries, which might be related to the GROUP BY issue if the aliasing is not being handled correctly.",

The patch should aim to correct the `group_by` logic to ensure that the correct fields are included in the GROUP BY clause when complex queries with subquery annotations are executed.\n- Ensure that the `group_by` attribute of the `Query` class is correctly set when the query involves subqueries, annotations, and functions like `TruncYear`, `Sum`, `Subquery`, and `OuterRef`.\n- Verify that the `Query` class's methods such as `get_group_by_cols`, `resolve_expression`, and any other methods that manipulate the GROUP BY clause are correctly handling expressions and references, especially when aliases are used.\n- Test the changes with the example query provided (`Book.objects.all().annotate().order_by().values().annotate().values()`) and compare the generated SQL against the expected correct SQL.\n- Ensure that the changes do not introduce regressions for other types of queries, particularly those that do not involve complex GROUP BY logic.\n- Once the patch is confirmed to resolve the issue, it should be submitted for inclusion in the Django codebase, following the project's contribution guidelines.\n\nRemember to test the solution thoroughly with different types of complex queries to ensure that the GROUP BY clause is generated correctly in all cases.",

The patch should aim to correct the `group_by` logic to ensure that the correct fields are included in the GROUP BY clause when complex queries with subquery annotations are executed.\n- Ensure that the `group_by` attribute of the `Query` class is correctly set when the query involves subqueries, annotations, and functions like `TruncYear`, `Sum`, `Subquery`, and `OuterRef`.\n- Verify that the `Query` class's methods such as `get_group_by_cols`, `resolve_expression`, and any other methods that manipulate the GROUP BY clause are correctly handling expressions and references, especially when aliases are used.\n- Test the changes with the example query provided (`Book.objects.all().annotate().order_by().values().annotate().values()`) and compare the generated SQL against the expected correct SQL.\n- Ensure that the changes do not introduce regressions for other types of queries, particularly those that do not involve complex GROUP BY logic.\n- Once the patch is confirmed to resolve the issue, it should be submitted for inclusion in the Django codebase, following the project's contribution guidelines.\n\nRemember to test the solution thoroughly with different types of complex queries to ensure that the GROUP BY clause is generated correctly in all cases.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 509 - 2560](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L509-L2560)\n\n This snippet deals with the handling of annotations and aggregates in subqueries, which is relevant to the issue of incorrect GROUP BY behavior in complex queries. \n\n\n   - [Lines 467 - 508](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L467-L508)\n\n This snippet is part of the logic that handles the creation of inner and outer queries for aggregation, which is directly related to the issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1160 - 1220](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1160-L1220)\n\n This snippet includes the resolve_expression method which is involved in resolving expressions for subqueries, which could be related to the GROUP BY clause issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 72 - 553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L72-L553)\n\n This snippet shows how annotations are inlined and masked, which could be relevant to the issue if the GROUP BY clause is incorrectly including fields due to annotation handling. \n\n\n   - [Lines 457 - 2668](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L457-L2668)\n\n This snippet contains conditions that determine when a GROUP BY clause is necessary, which could be relevant to the issue if the logic is incorrectly causing the GROUP BY clause to include unwanted fields.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet is part of the GROUP BY clause construction in SQL queries, which is central to the issue being reported. \n\n\n   - [Lines 630 - 691](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L630-L691)\n\n This snippet is involved in the handling of window function references and aliasing in subqueries, which might be related to the GROUP BY issue if the aliasing is not being handled correctly.",
