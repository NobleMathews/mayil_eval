    "body": "Description\n\t\nSteps to reproduce:\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Related(models.Model):\n\tmodels.ForeignKey(Thing)\nWith data\nt = Thing.objects.create()\nrs = [Related.objects.create(thing=t) for _ in range(2)]\nThe following query works as expected. The aggregation with Count produces a GROUP BY clause on related.id.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('rc').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 2}]>\nThis also works as expected (at least to me). Although there is an aggregation, ordering by related means that the grouping will be broken down.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('related').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nBut the following seems wrong to me.\n>>> Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc')\n<QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'rc': 1}, {'id': 1, 'rc': 1}]>\nThe random function call has nothing to do with the aggregation, and I see no reason it should break it. Dumping the query seems that indeed the random call breaks the group by call: (I simpilfied the table names a little)\n>>> print(Thing.objects.annotate(rc=Count('related')).order_by('?').values('id', 'rc').query)\nSELECT \"thing\".\"id\", COUNT(\"related\".\"id\") AS \"rc\" FROM \"thing\" LEFT OUTER JOIN \"related\" ON (\"thing\".\"id\" = \"related\".\"thing_id\") GROUP BY \"thing\".\"id\", RANDOM() ORDER BY RANDOM() ASC\nI dug into the SQL compiler, and it seems to me the problem is inside django.db.models.sql.compiler.get_group_by, where the compiler combines all non-aggregate, non-ref order_by expressions into group_by. I patched it like this\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\n\tif expr.contains_aggregate:\n\t\tcontinue\n\tif is_ref:\n\t\tcontinue\n\texpressions.extend([\n\t\texp for exp in expr.get_source_expressions()\n\t\tif not isinstance(exp, Random)\n\t])\nand things seem to work correctly. No failed tests against SQLite3 with default settings.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Remove `order_by('?')` from the queryset or replace it with a deterministic ordering if random ordering is not a strict requirement.\n- If random ordering is required and must work with aggregation, consider fetching the aggregated results first and then applying random ordering in Python using `random.shuffle()` or similar.\n- If the issue persists and a patch is indeed necessary, ensure that the patch is applied to the `get_group_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to handle the case when `order_by('?')` is used with aggregation. The patch should ensure that the random ordering does not interfere with the correct generation of the GROUP BY clause.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 79 - 154](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L79-L154)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for the GROUP BY clause, which is directly related to the issue of the random order_by('?') breaking the queryset aggregation. \n\n\n   - [Lines 459 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L459-L1596)\n\n This snippet includes the logic for handling order_by expressions in SQL compilation, which is relevant to the issue since the random ordering is affecting the GROUP BY behavior. \n\n\n   - [Lines 155 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L155-L1596)\n\n This snippet is part of the SQL compilation process and deals with expressions in the GROUP BY clause, which may need to be reviewed to understand how the random ordering affects the aggregation. \n\n\n   - [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet shows the construction of the GROUP BY clause in the SQL query, which is relevant to the issue as the random ordering seems to be incorrectly included in the GROUP BY.",
