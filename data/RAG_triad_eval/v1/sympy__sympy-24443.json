A set of permutations is called a \"group\" if::\n\n    a*b = c (for any pair of permutations in the group, a and b, their\n    product, c, is in the group)\n\n    a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c (for any 3 permutations in the group associativity holds)\n\n    there is an identity permutation, I, such that I*a = a*I for all elements\n    in the group\n\n    a*b = I (the inverse of each permutation is also in the group)\n\n    None of the polyhedron groups defined follow these definitions of a group.\n    Instead, they are selected to contain those permutations whose powers\n    alone will construct all orientations of the polyhedron, i.e. for\n    permutations ``a``, ``b``, etc... in the group, ``a, a**2, ..., a**o_a``,\n    ``b, b**2, ..., b**o_b``, etc...
