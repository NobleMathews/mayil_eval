    "title": "FieldError when migrating field to new model subclass.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nAnalogous to #21890. If creating a model subclass and moving a field onto it in the same step, makemigrations works but migrate dies with django.core.exceptions.FieldError: Local field 'title' in class 'Book' clashes with field of the same name from base class 'Readable'.\nFor example, take this model:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Readable(models.Model):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=200)\nAnd change to this:\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Readable(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Book(Readable):\n\ttitle = models.CharField(max_length=200)\nThe migration generates with CreateModel for Book, then RemoveField for Readable.title. But running it produces the error.\nReversing the order of the migration operations makes it pass. The auto-detector should be able to use this order.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To resolve the `FieldError` issue, follow these steps:\n\n- Ensure that the `Readable` model does not have a `title` field when the `Book` model is created with its own `title` field.\n- Modify the migration file for the `Book` model to first remove the `title` field from the `Readable` model before creating the `Book` model with a `title` field.\n- The migration operations should be ordered as follows:\n  - `RemoveField` operation for `Readable.title`\n  - `CreateModel` operation for `Book` with its own `title` field\n\nHere is an example of how the migration file should look:\n\n```python\n# Generated migration file (example)\n\nfrom django.db import migrations, models\n\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n\n    dependencies = [\n        # Specify the dependency on the previous migration file\n        # ('app_name', 'previous_migration_file'),\n    ]\n\n    operations = [\n        migrations.RemoveField(\n            model_name='readable',\n            name='title',\n        ),\n        migrations.CreateModel(\n            name='Book',\n            fields=[\n                # ... other fields ...\n                ('title', models.CharField(max_length=200)),\n                # ... other fields ...\n            ],\n            # ... other options ...\n        ),\n    ]\n```\n\n- Run `makemigrations` to generate a new migration file if necessary.\n- Run `migrate` to apply the migration changes to the database.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 258 - 308](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L258-L308)\n\n This snippet contains the logic that raises the FieldError when a local field clashes with a field from a base class, which is the core issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1774 - 2553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L1774-L2553)\n\n This snippet contains checks for field name clashes in multi-table inheritance, which is relevant to the issue of moving a field to a subclass. \n\n\n   - [Lines 331 - 349](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L331-L349)\n\n This snippet also deals with field name clashes in inheritance, specifically for private fields, which could be relevant to the issue if private fields are involved.",
