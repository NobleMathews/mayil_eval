It uses the\n    same decorators as :class:`~flask.Flask`, but defers the need for an\n    application by recording them for later registration.\n\n    Decorating a function with a blueprint creates a deferred function\n    that is called with :class:`~flask.blueprints.BlueprintSetupState`\n    when the blueprint is registered on an application.\n\n    See :doc:`/blueprints` for more information.\n\n    :param name: The name of the blueprint.
