    "title": "Store ModeState.fields into a dict.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nModeState initially stored its fields into a List[Tuple[str, models.Field]] because \u200bit wanted to preserve ordering.\nHowever the auto-detector doesn't consider field re-ordering as a state change and Django doesn't support table column reordering in the first place. The only reason I'm aware of for keeping field ordering is to generate model forms out of them which is unlikely to happen during migrations and if it was the case the only the order in which field are ordered and validated would change if Meta.fields = '__all__ is used \u200bwhich is discouraged.\nGiven storing fields this way results in awkward and inefficient lookup by name for no apparent benefits and that dict now preserves insertion ordering I suggest we switch ModelState.fields to Dict[str, models.Field]. I suggest we do the same for ModelState.indexes and .constraints since they suggest from the same awkwardness which was likely cargo culted from ModelState.fields design decision.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature request of changing `ModelState.fields` from a `List[Tuple[str, models.Field]]` to a `Dict[str, models.Field]`, follow these steps:\n\n- Update the `ModelState` class in `django/db/migrations/state.py` to store fields in a dictionary instead of a list of tuples.\n- Modify the `__init__` method of `ModelState` to accept a dictionary for fields and update the assignment accordingly.\n- Update any code that iterates over `ModelState.fields` to work with dictionary items instead of tuple pairs.\n- Ensure that all methods and properties that access `ModelState.fields` are updated to work with a dictionary.\n- Update the `ModelState.get_field` method to directly access the dictionary.\n- Perform similar changes for `ModelState.indexes` and `ModelState.constraints` if they are also stored as lists and need to be converted to dictionaries.\n- Update any other parts of the codebase that interact with `ModelState.fields`, `ModelState.indexes`, and `ModelState.constraints` to ensure compatibility with the new dictionary structure.\n- Run the Django test suite to ensure that the changes do not break existing functionality.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ModelState` class might be updated:\n\n```python\nclass ModelState:\n    # ...\n\n    def __init__(\n        self, app_label, name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None\n    ):\n        self.app_label = app_label\n        self.name = name\n        self.fields = fields  # fields is now expected to be a Dict[str, models.Field]\n        self.options = options or {}\n        self.options.setdefault(\"indexes\", {})  # Change to dict if needed\n        self.options.setdefault(\"constraints\", {})  # Change to dict if needed\n        self.bases = bases or (models.Model,)\n        self.managers = managers or []\n        # ... rest of the __init__ method ...\n\n    def get_field(self, field_name):\n        # Directly access the field from the dictionary\n        return self.fields.get(field_name)\n\n    # ... rest of the ModelState class ...\n```\n\nRemember to update the rest of the codebase to reflect these changes, including any serialization/deserialization logic that may be affected by the change from a list to a dictionary.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 769 - 829](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/state.py#L769-L829)\n\n This snippet shows the current implementation of storing fields in a list of tuples, which is what the issue suggests changing to a dict. \n\n\n   - [Lines 34 - 765](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/state.py#L34-L765)\n\n This snippet initializes ModelState with fields as a dict, which is relevant to the issue as it shows where the change from list to dict should occur.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 522 - 649](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L522-L649)\n\n This snippet uses the fields from ModelState in a dict-like manner, which is relevant to the issue as it shows how fields are accessed and may need to be updated after the change.",
