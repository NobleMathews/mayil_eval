    "title": "Problem with faulthandler when used with Twisted Logger and \"pytest --capture=no\"",
    "body": "Dear `pytest` developers,\r\n\r\nthanks a stack for conceiving and maintaining this excellent package. I never expected to file an issue or submit a patch here, but here we go.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nOn behalf of https://github.com/daq-tools/kotori/pull/38, we are currently in the progress of finally upgrading [Kotori](https://getkotori.org/) to Python 3. Kotori is based on Twisted and uses `pytest` for testing. Within [`kotori.util.logger`](https://github.com/daq-tools/kotori/blob/master/kotori/util/logger.py), we tried hard to apply some magic to make everything work together on all occasions with respect to appropriately configuring `twisted.logger` to our needs.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\nWe are on macOS 10.13.6.\r\n```\r\n$ pip list\r\npytest                        6.2.1\r\npytest-twisted                1.13.2\r\nTwisted                       20.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nThe background on this is that the Twisted Logger intercepts the logging by providing a file-like wrapper around the `STDERR` stream, which is obviously not an actual stream. In this case, when running with `pytest capture=no`, `pytest`'s `faulthandler` fails when trying to restore the `stderr` stream through `sys.stderr.fileno()` at [1] as this will actually return `-1`, in turn signaling an invalid file descriptor [2].\r\n\r\nIt will a) raise the exception outlined below and b) won't stop the process on teardown.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/6.2.1/src/_pytest/faulthandler.py#L69-L77\r\n[2] https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/twisted-20.3.0/src/twisted/logger/_io.py#L132-L139\r\n\r\n#### Traceback\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/bin/pytest\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(console_main())\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py\", line 185, in console_main\r\n    code = main()\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py\", line 162, in main\r\n    ret: Union[ExitCode, int] = config.hook.pytest_cmdline_main(\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/hooks.py\", line 286, in __call__\r\n    return self._hookexec(self, self.get_hookimpls(), kwargs)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/manager.py\", line 93, in _hookexec\r\n    return self._inner_hookexec(hook, methods, kwargs)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/manager.py\", line 84, in <lambda>\r\n    self._inner_hookexec = lambda hook, methods, kwargs: hook.multicall(\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/callers.py\", line 208, in _multicall\r\n    return outcome.get_result()\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/callers.py\", line 80, in get_result\r\n    raise ex[1].with_traceback(ex[2])\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/callers.py\", line 187, in _multicall\r\n    res = hook_impl.function(*args)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/main.py\", line 316, in pytest_cmdline_main\r\n    return wrap_session(config, _main)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/main.py\", line 311, in wrap_session\r\n    config._ensure_unconfigure()\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/config/__init__.py\", line 987, in _ensure_unconfigure\r\n    self.hook.pytest_unconfigure(config=self)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/hooks.py\", line 286, in __call__\r\n    return self._hookexec(self, self.get_hookimpls(), kwargs)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/manager.py\", line 93, in _hookexec\r\n    return self._inner_hookexec(hook, methods, kwargs)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/manager.py\", line 84, in <lambda>\r\n    self._inner_hookexec = lambda hook, methods, kwargs: hook.multicall(\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/callers.py\", line 208, in _multicall\r\n    return outcome.get_result()\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/callers.py\", line 80, in get_result\r\n    raise ex[1].with_traceback(ex[2])\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pluggy/callers.py\", line 187, in _multicall\r\n    res = hook_impl.function(*args)\r\n  File \"/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/_pytest/faulthandler.py\", line 69, in pytest_unconfigure\r\n    faulthandler.enable(file=self._get_stderr_fileno())\r\nValueError: file is not a valid file descripter\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Patch\r\nThis problem is mitigated by #8250.\r\n\r\nWith kind regards,\r\nAndreas.\r\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Review the `faulthandler.py` and `_io.py` files for the use of `sys.stderr.fileno()` and ensure that it is only called when `sys.stderr` is attached to a valid file descriptor.\n- If `twisted.logger` is replacing `sys.stderr` with an instance of `FakeFileWrapper` that returns an invalid file descriptor, modify the `pytest_unconfigure` function to check if `sys.stderr` has a valid file descriptor before calling `faulthandler.enable`.\n- Implement a check in `pytest_unconfigure` to determine if `sys.stderr` is an instance of `FakeFileWrapper` or similar, and if so, avoid calling `faulthandler.enable` with `sys.stderr.fileno()`.\n- Alternatively, modify the `FakeFileWrapper` class to return a valid file descriptor if possible, or to raise a more informative exception when its `fileno()` method is called.\n- Ensure that the `pytest_unconfigure` function gracefully handles the `ValueError` by either logging an appropriate message or by skipping the call to `faulthandler.enable` when `--capture=no` is used with Twisted Logger.\n- Apply the patch referenced as `#8250` if it addresses the issue and has been accepted into the codebase after proper review.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//.github) \u2192 [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)- [Lines 1 - 5](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml#L1-L5)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it pertains to the configuration of issue templates on GitHub, which is unrelated to the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//.github)- [Lines 1 - 2](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//.github/config.yml#L1-L2)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it contains configuration for Read the Docs, which is unrelated to the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [src](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//src)- [Lines 1 - 10](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//src/py.py#L1-L10)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it deals with the shim for pylib and does not pertain to the interaction between faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [extra](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//extra)- [Lines 1 - 85](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//extra/get_issues.py#L1-L85)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a script for getting GitHub issues and has no connection to the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [scripts](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//scripts)- [Lines 1 - 17](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//scripts/towncrier-draft-to-file.py#L1-L17)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a script for towncrier, which is used for managing changelogs and does not relate to the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [scripts](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//scripts)- [Lines 1 - 46](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//scripts/prepare-release-pr.py#L1-L46)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a script for preparing release PRs and does not address the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 13](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//bench/bench.py#L1-L13)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a benchmarking script for pytest and does not involve the interaction between faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 14](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//bench/manyparam.py#L1-L14)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a test file with parameterized fixtures and does not relate to the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/tree//.github)- [Lines 1 - 5](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//.github/FUNDING.yml#L1-L5)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it pertains to funding configuration for the pytest repository and is unrelated to the problem with faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.\n- - [Lines 73 - 108](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.3/blob//.pre-commit-config.yaml#L73-L108)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a configuration file for pre-commit hooks and does not pertain to the interaction between faulthandler, Twisted Logger, and pytest.",
