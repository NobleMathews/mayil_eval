    "title": "Better Indication of Squash Migration State in showmigrations",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nIn the discussion of #25231 (\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/5112) it became clear that there was a disconnect between the current output of showmigrations and the actual recorded applied state of squashed migrations.\nCurrently if all of the replaced/original migrations have been run, showmigrations will output that the related squashed migration has been applied with an [X] in the output even if that has not yet been recorded by the migration recorder. However, it is currently a requirement that migrate be run to record this applied state for the squashed migration before the original migrations are removed. If a deployment process is looking for an empty [ ] to know to run the migration then this may trip it up.\nThis case is to consider an output for showmigrations which can indicate that this migration has only been \"soft\" applied, that is applied but not recorded yet.\nChanges to the planner for such an output may also impact #24900.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature request for a better indication of squash migration state in `showmigrations`, you will need to modify the `showmigrations` command to differentiate between fully applied migrations and \"soft\" applied migrations (i.e., migrations that have been applied but not recorded). Here's a high-level overview of the steps to implement this feature:\n\n- Modify the `MigrationRecorder` class to include a method that checks if a squashed migration has been recorded.\n- Update the `showmigrations` command to use this new method and display a different indicator for \"soft\" applied migrations.\n- Ensure that the output is clear and understandable to users.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Add a method to `MigrationRecorder` to check if a squashed migration is recorded:\n```python\n# Filename: django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n\nclass MigrationRecorder(object):\n    # ...\n\n    def is_squashed_migration_recorded(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Check if a squashed migration has been recorded.\"\"\"\n        return self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).exists()\n```\n\n2. Modify the `showmigrations` command to use the new method and display a different indicator for \"soft\" applied migrations:\n```python\n# Filename: django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    # ...\n\n    def show_plan(self, connection, app_names=None):\n        # ...\n        loader = MigrationLoader(connection)\n        recorder = MigrationRecorder(connection)\n        # ...\n\n        for node in plan:\n            # ...\n            if node.key in loader.applied_migrations:\n                if recorder.is_squashed_migration_recorded(*node.key):\n                    self.stdout.write(\"[X]  %s.%s%s\" % (node.key[0], node.key[1], deps))\n                else:\n                    # Indicate a \"soft\" applied migration with a different symbol, e.g., \"[~]\"\n                    self.stdout.write(\"[~]  %s.%s%s\" % (node.key[0], node.key[1], deps))\n            else:\n                self.stdout.write(\"[ ]  %s.%s%s\" % (node.key[0], node.key[1], deps))\n        # ...\n```\n\n3. Update the help text for the `showmigrations` command to explain the new indicator:\n```python\n# Filename: django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    help = \"Shows all available migrations for the current project, indicating which are applied, unapplied, and 'soft' applied (applied but not recorded). [X] indicates applied, [~] indicates 'soft' applied, and [ ] indicates unapplied.\"\n    # ...\n```\n\n4. Test the changes to ensure that the new indicator is displayed correctly for \"soft\" applied migrations and that the existing functionality of `showmigrations` is not affected.\n\n5. Update the documentation to reflect the new feature and explain the meaning of the new indicator in the `showmigrations` output.\n\nRemember to follow the Django contribution guidelines for writing tests and documentation for the new feature.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 290 - 305](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/executor.py#L290-L305)\n\n This snippet contains logic for marking replacement migrations as applied if their replaced set all are, which is directly related to the issue of indicating the 'soft' applied state in showmigrations.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 134 - 176](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/core/management/commands/showmigrations.py#L134-L176)\n\n This snippet is part of the showmigrations command output logic, which is what the issue is about - improving the output to indicate the actual recorded applied state of squashed migrations.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 84 - 111](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/recorder.py#L84-L111)\n\n This snippet deals with recording applied migrations, which is relevant to the issue since it involves the recording of the applied state of squashed migrations.",

Add a method to `MigrationRecorder` to check if a squashed migration is recorded:\n```python\n# Filename: django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n\nclass MigrationRecorder(object):\n    # ...\n\n    def is_squashed_migration_recorded(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Check if a squashed migration has been recorded.\"\"\"\n        return self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).exists()\n```\n\n2.
