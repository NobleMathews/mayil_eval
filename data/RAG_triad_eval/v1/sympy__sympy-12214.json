    "mayil_response": "The issue seems to be related to the generation of the knot vector for B-splines of degree greater than 1. The `sy.bspline_basis_set` function expects a knot vector with a specific structure, which depends on the degree of the B-spline. The knot vector must have `degree + 1` repetitions at the start and end to define the boundary conditions for the spline.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of how to generate a proper knot vector for a B-spline of degree `d`:\n\n- The number of knots needed is `len(control_points) + d + 1`.\n- The knot vector should start with `d + 1` copies of the first knot value and end with `d + 1` copies of the last knot value.\n- The internal knots (those between the first and last) can be uniformly spaced or follow some other distribution depending on the desired properties of the B-spline.\n\nBased on the provided code snippets, here is a pseudo code to generate a proper knot vector for a B-spline of degree `d`:\n\n```python\ndef generate_knot_vector(degree, control_points):\n    num_knots = len(control_points) + degree + 1\n    first_knot = control_points[0]\n    last_knot = control_points[-1]\n    \n    # Generate the uniform internal knots\n    internal_knots = np.linspace(first_knot, last_knot, num_knots - (2 * (degree + 1)))\n    \n    # Concatenate the knots with the correct repetitions at the start and end\n    knots = np.concatenate((\n        np.repeat(first_knot, degree + 1),\n        internal_knots,\n        np.repeat(last_knot, degree + 1)\n    ))\n    return knots\n```\n\nTo fix the issue in the ticket, you should ensure that the knot vector is generated correctly for the desired degree of the B-spline. The `np.concatenate` line in the ticket seems to be on the right track, but it's not clear how `knots` is defined before this line. Ensure that `knots` contains the correct internal knot values before concatenating the repeated start and end values.",

They are defined on a\n    set of knots, which is a sequence of integers or floats.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    The 0th degree splines have a value of 1 on a single interval:\n\n        >>> from sympy import bspline_basis\n        >>> from sympy.abc import x\n        >>> d = 0\n        >>> knots = tuple(range(5))\n        >>> bspline_basis(d, knots, 0, x)\n        Piecewise((1, (x >= 0) & (x <= 1)), (0, True))\n\n    For a given ``(d, knots)`` there are ``len(knots)-d-1`` B-splines\n    defined, that are indexed by ``n`` (starting at 0).\n\n    Here is an example of a cubic B-spline:\n\n        >>> bspline_basis(3, tuple(range(5)), 0, x)\n        Piecewise((x**3/6, (x >= 0) & (x <= 1)),\n                  (-x**3/2 + 2*x**2 - 2*x + 2/3,\n                  (x >= 1) & (x <= 2)),\n                  (x**3/2 - 4*x**2 + 10*x - 22/3,\n                  (x >= 2) & (x <= 3)),\n                  (-x**3/6 + 2*x**2 - 8*x + 32/3,\n                  (x >= 3) & (x <= 4)),\n                  (0, True))\n\n    By repeating knot points, you can introduce discontinuities in the\n    B-splines and their derivatives:\n\n        >>> d = 1\n        >>> knots = (0, 0, 2, 3, 4)\n        >>> bspline_basis(d, knots, 0, x)\n        Piecewise((1 - x/2, (x >= 0) & (x <= 2)), (0, True))\n\n    It is quite time consuming to construct and evaluate B-splines. If\n    you need to evaluate a B-spline many times, it is best to lambdify them\n    first:\n\n        >>> from sympy import lambdify\n        >>> d = 3\n        >>> knots = tuple(range(10))\n        >>> b0 = bspline_basis(d, knots, 0, x)\n        >>> f = lambdify(x, b0)\n        >>> y = f(0.5)\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    bspline_basis_set\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..

The `sy.bspline_basis_set` function expects a knot vector with a specific structure, which depends on the degree of the B-spline. The knot vector must have `degree + 1` repetitions at the start and end to define the boundary conditions for the spline.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of how to generate a proper knot vector for a B-spline of degree `d`:\n\n- The number of knots needed is `len(control_points) + d + 1`.\n- The knot vector should start with `d + 1` copies of the first knot value and end with `d + 1` copies of the last knot value.\n- The internal knots (those between the first and last) can be uniformly spaced or follow some other distribution depending on the desired properties of the B-spline.\n\nBased on the provided code snippets, here is a pseudo code to generate a proper knot vector for a B-spline of degree `d`:\n\n```python\ndef generate_knot_vector(degree, control_points):\n    num_knots = len(control_points) + degree + 1\n    first_knot = control_points[0]\n    last_knot = control_points[-1]\n    \n    # Generate the uniform internal knots\n    internal_knots = np.linspace(first_knot, last_knot, num_knots - (2 * (degree + 1)))\n    \n    # Concatenate the knots with the correct repetitions at the start and end\n    knots = np.concatenate((\n        np.repeat(first_knot, degree + 1),\n        internal_knots,\n        np.repeat(last_knot, degree + 1)\n    ))\n    return knots\n```\n\nTo fix the issue in the ticket, you should ensure that the knot vector is generated correctly for the desired degree of the B-spline. The `np.concatenate` line in the ticket seems to be on the right track, but it's not clear how `knots` is defined before this line. Ensure that `knots` contains the correct internal knot values before concatenating the repeated start and end values.",

        "result": "The issue seems to be related to the generation of the knot vector for B-splines of degree greater than 1. The `sy.bspline_basis_set` function expects a knot vector with a specific structure, which depends on the degree of the B-spline. The knot vector must have `degree + 1` repetitions at the start and end to define the boundary conditions for the spline.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of how to generate a proper knot vector for a B-spline of degree `d`:\n\n- The number of knots needed is `len(control_points) + d + 1`.\n- The knot vector should start with `d + 1` copies of the first knot value and end with `d + 1` copies of the last knot value.\n- The internal knots (those between the first and last) can be uniformly spaced or follow some other distribution depending on the desired properties of the B-spline.\n\nBased on the provided code snippets, here is a pseudo code to generate a proper knot vector for a B-spline of degree `d`:\n\n```python\ndef generate_knot_vector(degree, control_points):\n    num_knots = len(control_points) + degree + 1\n    first_knot = control_points[0]\n    last_knot = control_points[-1]\n    \n    # Generate the uniform internal knots\n    internal_knots = np.linspace(first_knot, last_knot, num_knots - (2 * (degree + 1)))\n    \n    # Concatenate the knots with the correct repetitions at the start and end\n    knots = np.concatenate((\n        np.repeat(first_knot, degree + 1),\n        internal_knots,\n        np.repeat(last_knot, degree + 1)\n    ))\n    return knots\n```\n\nTo fix the issue in the ticket, you should ensure that the knot vector is generated correctly for the desired degree of the B-spline. The `np.concatenate` line in the ticket seems to be on the right track, but it's not clear how `knots` is defined before this line. Ensure that `knots` contains the correct internal knot values before concatenating the repeated start and end values.",

            "reason": "Criteria: The RESPONSE is relevant to the entire PROMPT and answers the entire PROMPT completely.\nSupporting Evidence: The RESPONSE directly addresses the user's confusion about generating a knot vector for B-splines of degree greater than 1. It explains the structure that the `sy.bspline_basis_set` function expects for the knot vector, which is the core issue the user is facing. The RESPONSE provides a high-level overview of the requirements for a proper knot vector and offers pseudo code to generate it correctly, which is precisely what the user is seeking help with. The RESPONSE is fully relevant to the PROMPT, as it provides the necessary context and solution to the user's problem with B-splines and knot vector generation."
