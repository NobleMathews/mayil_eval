    "mayil_response": "- The issue is with the `two_sum` function in `astropy/time/utils.py` when handling very large floating-point numbers.\n- The test `test_two_sum_symmetric` expects `two_sum(f1, f2)` to equal `two_sum(f2, f1)` for any floats `f1` and `f2`.\n- The test is failing for the example `f1=-3.089785075544792e+307, f2=1.7976931348623157e+308`.\n\nTo address the issue:\n- Review the `two_sum` function implementation for numerical stability when dealing with large floating-point numbers.\n- Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the magnitude of the numbers causes loss of precision due to floating-point arithmetic limitations.\n- If necessary, refactor the `two_sum` function to improve its numerical stability, possibly using an algorithm that is less susceptible to floating-point errors when summing numbers with large differences in magnitude.\n- After refactoring, run the `test_two_sum_symmetric` to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [astropy](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.0/tree//astropy) \u2192 [time](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.0/tree//astropy/time)- [Lines 78 - 141](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.0/blob//astropy/time/utils.py#L78-L141)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of the 'two_sum' function, which is directly related to the test failure mentioned in the issue. The issue is about the 'two_sum' function producing different results depending on the order of the arguments, which is exactly what this snippet is about.",

        "result": "- The issue is with the `two_sum` function in `astropy/time/utils.py` when handling very large floating-point numbers.\n- The test `test_two_sum_symmetric` expects `two_sum(f1, f2)` to equal `two_sum(f2, f1)` for any floats `f1` and `f2`.\n- The test is failing for the example `f1=-3.089785075544792e+307, f2=1.7976931348623157e+308`.\n\nTo address the issue:\n- Review the `two_sum` function implementation for numerical stability when dealing with large floating-point numbers.\n- Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the magnitude of the numbers causes loss of precision due to floating-point arithmetic limitations.\n- If necessary, refactor the `two_sum` function to improve its numerical stability, possibly using an algorithm that is less susceptible to floating-point errors when summing numbers with large differences in magnitude.\n- After refactoring, run the `test_two_sum_symmetric` to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [astropy](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.0/tree//astropy) \u2192 [time](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.0/tree//astropy/time)- [Lines 78 - 141](https://github.com/testbed/astropy__astropy__5.0/blob//astropy/time/utils.py#L78-L141)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of the 'two_sum' function, which is directly related to the test failure mentioned in the issue. The issue is about the 'two_sum' function producing different results depending on the order of the arguments, which is exactly what this snippet is about.",

It provides a detailed explanation of the problem, the context of the failing test case, and offers a step-by-step approach to resolving the issue, including reviewing and potentially refactoring the `two_sum` function for numerical stability. The RESPONSE also includes a link to the relevant code snippet, which is directly related to the problem at hand. The RESPONSE is fully relevant to the entire PROMPT and provides a complete answer."
