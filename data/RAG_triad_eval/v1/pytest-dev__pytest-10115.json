    "title": "Get rid of atomicwrites (unmaintained)",
    "body": "PyPI has started enforcing 2-factor-auth for maintainers of various popular packages: https://twitter.com/pypi/status/1545455297388584960\r\n\r\nFor context, here is the mail I got:\r\n\r\n> Congratulations! A project you ('The_Compiler') maintain has been designated as a critical project on PyPI. You can see which project(s) has been designated at http://pypi.org/manage/projects/.\r\n>\r\n> As part of this effort, in the coming months maintainers of projects designated as critical, like yourself, will be required to enable two-factor authentication on their account in order to add new releases or otherwise modify a critical \r\nproject.\r\n>\r\n> Since you already have two-factor authentication enabled on your account, there's nothing you need to do at this time.\r\n>\r\n> PS: To make it easier for maintainers like you to enable two-factor authentication, we're also distributing security keys to eligible maintainers. See http://pypi.org/security-key-giveaway/ for more details.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this has caused the maintainer of `atomicwrites` to go on what I can only describe as a rampage, first deleting the project from PyPI (and then finding out it's not possible to restore it): https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites/issues/61\r\n\r\n...to then simply declare the project as unmaintained outright: https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites/commit/d18328460520e18b4f197297f962d4444c5889b6\r\n\r\nNo matter what the outcome of this will be, IMHO, given those actions I do not feel comfortable with trusting this dependency for something as popular as pytest.\r\n\r\nThe library itself [is relatively simple](https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites/blob/master/atomicwrites/__init__.py), and we only use it on Windows. It's MIT-licensed. Should we just copy the parts we need into pytest instead?\n",
