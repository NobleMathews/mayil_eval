    "title": "Possibly move ``MessagesHandlerMixIn`` into ``PyLinter``",
    "body": "### Current problem\n\nThe `MessagesHandlerMixIn` currently sits in its own document within the `pylint/message` directory. [Link](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/main/pylint/message/message_handler_mix_in.py)\r\nThe class is always mixed with `PyLinter` except for one occasion where a class method is used.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/86c073e49fc099d8111da96cfbb2f30ccd659338/pylint/message/message_handler_mix_in.py#L235-L258\r\nOne of its most used methods is `add_message`, which handles the messages added by all checkers. However, this method is also a good example of why we are running into trouble with `MessagesHandlerMixIn` being its own class. We added `self: \"PyLinter\"` because we needed the `PyLinter` annotation for `self.msgs_store.get_message_definitions(msgid)`. However, `add_message` is also called from within `MessagesHandlerMixIn` and `self` is then not `PyLinter`. `mypy` complains about this (justifiably). \r\nThere are many more methods were we basically need to type `self` as being simultaneously `PyLinter` and `MessagesHandlerMixIn`.\r\nI have created a [branch](https://github.com/DanielNoord/pylint/tree/typing-message-mix-in) with a commit that adds typing to `MessagesHandlerMixIn`. You can clone this branch locally and see that `mypy` will fail with 20+ errors all related on the double dependency of `PyLinter` and `MessagesHandlerMixIn`.\n\n### Desired solution\n\nI would propose to merge `MessagesHandlerMixIn` into `PyLinter` to avoid these problems of dependency on each other. \r\n\r\nAnother solution would be to find a way to type `self` to be two classes simultaneously. But I don't think this is possible (or desirable in general).\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n",
