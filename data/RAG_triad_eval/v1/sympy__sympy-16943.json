    "mayil_response": "- The issue is with the `fps` function not returning an object that supports indexing when called with a polynomial like `x ** 2`.\n- The `fps` function should return a `FormalPowerSeries` object that supports indexing, but it is returning a `Pow` object instead.\n- The `FormalPowerSeries` class has an `__getitem__` method that allows indexing, but it seems that the `fps` function is not returning an instance of this class when it should.\n\nSolution:\n- Modify the `fps` function to ensure that it always returns a `FormalPowerSeries` object when it is supposed to.\n- Check the `compute_fps` function to ensure that it returns the correct type of object (`ak`, `xk`, `ind`) that can be used to create a `FormalPowerSeries` object.\n- If `compute_fps` is returning `None` for polynomials, it should instead return the appropriate sequences that represent the polynomial in the formal power series form.\n- Add an `__getitem__` method to the `FormalPowerSeries` class if it does not exist, or ensure that it works correctly for polynomials.\n- Update the documentation of `fps` to clearly state the expected behavior when the input is a polynomial.\n\nHere is a possible implementation fix:\n\n```python\ndef fps(f, x=None, x0=0, dir=1, hyper=True, order=4, rational=True, full=False):\n    f = sympify(f)\n\n    if x is None:\n        free = f.free_symbols\n        if len(free) == 1:\n            x = free.pop()\n        elif not free:\n            return f\n        else:\n            raise NotImplementedError(\"multivariate formal power series\")\n\n    result = compute_fps(f, x, x0, dir, hyper, order, rational, full)\n\n    # Check if the result is None and f is a polynomial, then handle accordingly\n    if result is None and f.is_polynomial(x):\n        ak = sequence(f.as_poly().all_coeffs()[::-1], (Dummy('k'), 0, oo))\n        xk = sequence(x**Dummy('k'), (Dummy('k'), 0, oo))\n        ind = S.Zero\n        result = (ak, xk, ind)\n\n    if result is None:\n        return f\n\n    return FormalPowerSeries(f, x, x0, dir, result)\n```\n\nThis fix ensures that when `compute_fps` returns `None` for a polynomial, the `fps` function constructs the appropriate sequences to represent the polynomial as a formal power series.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [series](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/series)- [Lines 1714 - 1792](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/series/formal.py#L1714-L1792)\n\n This snippet contains the 'fps' function which is directly related to the issue. It is where the series expansion is supposed to be generated and returned as a 'FormalPowerSeries' object. \n\n\n   - [Lines 933 - 1484](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/series/formal.py#L933-L1484)\n\n This snippet defines the 'FormalPowerSeries' class, which is expected to be returned by the 'fps' function. It is relevant to understand how the series object is structured and how it should behave. \n\n\n   - [Lines 851 - 929](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/series/formal.py#L851-L929)\n\n This snippet contains the 'compute_fps' function which is called by 'fps' and is responsible for computing the formula for the series. It may contain logic that leads to the issue.",

There can be two types of constant terms in the series:\n\n        + A constant value or symbol.\n        + A term of a multivariate series not involving the generator, with\n          respect to which the series is to expanded.\n\n      Strictly speaking, a generator of a ring should not be considered a\n      constant. However, for series expansion both the cases need similar\n      treatment (as the user doesn't care about inner details), i.e, use an\n      addition formula to separate the constant part and the variable part (see\n      rs_sin for reference).\n\n    - All the algorithms used here are primarily designed to work for Taylor\n      series (number of iterations in the algo equals the required order).\n      Hence, it becomes tricky to get the series of the right order if a\n      Puiseux series is input. Use rs_puiseux? in your function if your\n      algorithm is not designed to handle fractional powers.\n\nExtending rs_series\n-------------------\n\nTo make a function work with rs_series you need to do two things::\n\n    - Many sure it works with a constant term (as explained above).\n    - If the series contains constant terms, you might need to extend its ring.\n      You do so by adding the new terms to the rings as generators.\n      ``PolyRing.compose`` and ``PolyRing.add_gens`` are two functions that do\n      so and need to be called every time you expand a series containing a\n      constant term.\n\nLook at rs_sin and rs_series for further reference.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom sympy.polys.domains import QQ, EX\nfrom sympy.polys.rings import PolyElement, ring, sring\nfrom sympy.polys.polyerrors import DomainError\nfrom sympy.polys.monomials import (monomial_min, monomial_mul, monomial_div,\n                                   monomial_ldiv)\nfrom mpmath.libmp.libintmath import ifac\nfrom sympy.core import PoleError, Function, Expr\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import Rational, igcd\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import as_int\nfrom sympy.functions import sin, cos, tan, atan, exp, atanh, tanh, log, ceiling\nfrom mpmath.libmp.libintmath import giant_steps\nimport math",
