    "body": "For the past months I've been under the impression that the negative score is not very friendly for beginners. It somewhat demotivating to run `pylint` over your project just to get a `-24/10.0` as a score, which would make `pylint` look like a super drastic tool, that's super nitpicky about everything.\r\n\r\nI think we could do a better job here at welcoming everyone to using `pylint`. Instead of having a `0-10` score, we could check if other tools are doing something different and see what works best in general. \nThe negative score is not very beginner friendly\nFor the past months I've been under the impression that the negative score is not very friendly for beginners.

    "mayil_response": "- Review the `pylint` scoring system implementation to ensure it does not produce negative scores.\n- Modify the `calculate_score` function to set a floor of `0` for the score, preventing negative values.\n- Adjust the `format_score` function to display the score within a non-negative range, such as `0-10`.\n- Ensure that the score is properly normalized if the range is adjusted to maintain consistency with the `10.0` maximum score that `pylint` traditionally uses.\n- If the scoring system is tied to specific messages or checkers, review their implementations to ensure they contribute to the score within the desired range.\n- Consider implementing a flag or configuration option to toggle between the traditional scoring system and the new beginner-friendly non-negative scoring system.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint) \u2192 [lint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/lint)- [Lines 3 - 595](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/lint/base_options.py#L3-L595)\n\n This snippet contains the 'suggestion-mode' option which might be relevant to the issue as it pertains to making pylint more beginner-friendly by providing user-friendly hints.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint)- [Lines 1 - 107](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/constants.py#L1-L107)\n\n This snippet defines constants and message types used by pylint, which could be relevant when considering changes to the scoring system to make it more beginner-friendly.",
