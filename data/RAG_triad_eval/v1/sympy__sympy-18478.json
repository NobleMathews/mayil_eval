    "mayil_response": "The difference in behavior when substituting `x` with `oo` (infinity) in the expressions `(x+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` and `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` is due to the way SymPy handles limits and the fact that `cos(x)` is bounded while `exp(x)` grows without bound.\n\n- `(x+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` evaluates to `oo` because:\n  - The limit of `x` as `x` approaches infinity is infinity.\n  - The limit of `cos(x)` as `x` approaches infinity does not exist in the classical sense, but since `cos(x)` is bounded, it does not affect the unbounded growth of `x`. Therefore, the result is `oo`.\n\n- `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` evaluates to `AccumBounds` because:\n  - The limit of `exp(x)` as `x` approaches infinity is infinity.\n  - The limit of `cos(x)` as `x` approaches infinity oscillates between `-1` and `1`.\n  - When adding a bounded oscillating function (`cos(x)`) to a function that grows without bound (`exp(x)`), the result is an accumulation of values that can be represented by `AccumBounds`. This is because `exp(x)` will grow towards infinity, but the exact value at infinity is not a single number due to the addition of `cos(x)`, which keeps oscillating.\n\nIn summary, the difference in the results is due to the properties of the functions involved and how they behave towards infinity. The `cos(x)` term is bounded and does not affect the limit of `x` going to infinity, but it does affect the limit of `exp(x)` going to infinity by introducing an oscillation that is captured by `AccumBounds`.",

This is forced, since we have,\n    for example, `1/AccumBounds(0, 1) = AccumBounds(1, oo)`, and the limit at\n    `0` is not one-sided. As x tends to `0-`, then `1/x -> -oo`, so `-oo`\n    should be interpreted as belonging to `AccumBounds(1, oo)` though it need\n    not appear explicitly.\n\n    In many cases it suffices to know that the limit set is bounded.\n    However, in some other cases more exact information could be useful.\n    For example, all accumulation values of cos(x) + 1 are non-negative.\n    (AccumBounds(-1, 1) + 1 = AccumBounds(0, 2))\n\n    A AccumulationBounds object is defined to be real AccumulationBounds,\n    if its end points are finite reals.\n\n    Let `X`, `Y` be real AccumulationBounds, then their sum, difference,\n    product are defined to be the following sets:\n\n    `X + Y = \\{ x+y \\mid x \\in X \\cap y \\in Y\\}`\n\n    `X - Y = \\{ x-y \\mid x \\in X \\cap y \\in Y\\}`\n\n    `X * Y = \\{ x*y \\mid x \\in X \\cap y \\in Y\\}`\n\n    There is, however, no consensus on Interval division.\n\n    `X / Y = \\{ z \\mid \\exists x \\in X, y \\in Y \\mid y \\neq 0, z = x/y\\}`\n\n    Note: According to this definition the quotient of two AccumulationBounds\n    may not be a AccumulationBounds object but rather a union of\n    AccumulationBounds.\n\n    Note\n    ====\n\n    The main focus in the interval arithmetic is on the simplest way to\n    calculate upper and lower endpoints for the range of values of a\n    function in one or more variables.

Therefore, the result is `oo`.\n\n- `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` evaluates to `AccumBounds` because:\n  - The limit of `exp(x)` as `x` approaches infinity is infinity.\n  - The limit of `cos(x)` as `x` approaches infinity oscillates between `-1` and `1`.\n  - When adding a bounded oscillating function (`cos(x)`) to a function that grows without bound (`exp(x)`), the result is an accumulation of values that can be represented by `AccumBounds`. This is because `exp(x)` will grow towards infinity, but the exact value at infinity is not a single number due to the addition of `cos(x)`, which keeps oscillating.\n\nIn summary, the difference in the results is due to the properties of the functions involved and how they behave towards infinity. The `cos(x)` term is bounded and does not affect the limit of `x` going to infinity, but it does affect the limit of `exp(x)` going to infinity by introducing an oscillation that is captured by `AccumBounds`.",

It correctly identifies the properties of the functions involved and explains how the bounded nature of 'cos(x)' interacts with the unbounded growth of 'x' and 'exp(x)' respectively. The explanation of 'AccumBounds' is accurate and helps to understand the behavior of the 'exp(x)+cos(x)' expression at infinity. The RESPONSE is well-structured and directly addresses the question posed in the PROMPT, providing a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of the SymPy substitution with infinity.",

        "result": "The difference in behavior when substituting `x` with `oo` (infinity) in the expressions `(x+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` and `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` is due to the way SymPy handles limits and the fact that `cos(x)` is bounded while `exp(x)` grows without bound.\n\n- `(x+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` evaluates to `oo` because:\n  - The limit of `x` as `x` approaches infinity is infinity.\n  - The limit of `cos(x)` as `x` approaches infinity does not exist in the classical sense, but since `cos(x)` is bounded, it does not affect the unbounded growth of `x`. Therefore, the result is `oo`.\n\n- `(exp(x)+cos(x)).subs(x,oo)` evaluates to `AccumBounds` because:\n  - The limit of `exp(x)` as `x` approaches infinity is infinity.\n  - The limit of `cos(x)` as `x` approaches infinity oscillates between `-1` and `1`.\n  - When adding a bounded oscillating function (`cos(x)`) to a function that grows without bound (`exp(x)`), the result is an accumulation of values that can be represented by `AccumBounds`. This is because `exp(x)` will grow towards infinity, but the exact value at infinity is not a single number due to the addition of `cos(x)`, which keeps oscillating.\n\nIn summary, the difference in the results is due to the properties of the functions involved and how they behave towards infinity. The `cos(x)` term is bounded and does not affect the limit of `x` going to infinity, but it does affect the limit of `exp(x)` going to infinity by introducing an oscillation that is captured by `AccumBounds`.",

It explains why one expression evaluates to infinity and the other to `AccumBounds`, which is precisely what the PROMPT is asking. The RESPONSE is relevant to the entire PROMPT and answers the question completely, thus deserving a score of 10."
