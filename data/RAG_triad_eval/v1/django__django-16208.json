    "body": "Description\n\t\nBackground: I was debugging database calls today with the django.db.backends log.\nProblem: The BEGIN SQL calls show up in the logs, but there is no way to see when the transaction is commited or if it is rolled back. \nAs easy solution would be to log commits and rollbacks as well.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To address the enhancement request for logging transaction commits and rollbacks in Django, you can modify the `commit` and `rollback` functions in the `django/db/transaction.py` file to include logging statements. Here's how you can do it:\n\n- Import the logging module at the beginning of the `transaction.py` file:\n  ```python\n  import logging\n  ```\n\n- Create a logger instance at the beginning of the `transaction.py` file:\n  ```python\n  logger = logging.getLogger('django.db.backends')\n  ```\n\n- Modify the `commit` function to log the commit operation:\n  ```python\n  def commit(using=None):\n      \"\"\"Commit a transaction.\"\"\"\n      connection = get_connection(using)\n      connection.commit()\n      logger.info(\"Transaction commit on database '%s'\", using or DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS)\n  ```\n\n- Modify the `rollback` function to log the rollback operation:\n  ```python\n  def rollback(using=None):\n      \"\"\"Roll back a transaction.\"\"\"\n      connection = get_connection(using)\n      connection.rollback()\n      logger.info(\"Transaction rollback on database '%s'\", using or DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS)\n  ```\n\nThese changes will add logging for commit and rollback events, which will help in debugging transaction-related issues. Make sure that the logging configuration for `django.db.backends` is set up to capture info-level logs.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/db)- [Lines 100 - 139](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L100-L139)\n\n This snippet contains the 'on_commit' function which is used to register functions to be called when a transaction is committed.
