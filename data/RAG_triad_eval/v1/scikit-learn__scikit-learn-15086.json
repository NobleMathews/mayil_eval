    "body": "There is something wrong with `MultiTaskLassoCV` and binary features. It always returns the same mse for all the alphas and hence chooses a huge regularization zeroing out all coefficients. The same holds for `MultiTaskElasticNet` too.

Moreover it doesn't happen if I set `fit_intercept=False`, or if I generate random normal features.\r\n\r\nI am working on anaconda, windows system, with python 3.7.1 and with scikit-learn v0.21.3, numpy v1.16.2.\r\n\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import MultiTaskLassoCV, LassoCV\r\nnp.random.seed(123)\r\nn = 1000\r\nd = 3\r\nX = np.random.binomial(1, .5, size=(n, d))\r\ny = X[:, [0, 0]].copy()\r\nest = MultiTaskLassoCV(n_alphas=5, fit_intercept=True).fit(X, y)\r\nprint(est.alpha_)\r\nprint(est.mse_path_)\r\nprint(est.coef_)\r\nprint(est.intercept_)\r\n```\r\nIt returns\r\n```\r\n0.35353076317627596\r\n[[0.25018905 0.2499848  0.24997129]\r\n [0.25018905 0.2499848  0.24997129]\r\n [0.25018905 0.2499848  0.24997129]\r\n [0.25018905 0.2499848  0.24997129]\r\n [0.25018905 0.2499848  0.24997129]]\r\n[[ 0. -0.  0.]\r\n [ 0. -0.  0.]]\r\n[0.496 0.496]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I generate normal features X, then things are good:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import MultiTaskLassoCV, LassoCV\r\nnp.random.seed(123)\r\nn = 1000\r\nd = 3\r\nX = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(n, d))\r\ny = X[:, [0, 0]].copy()\r\nest = MultiTaskLassoCV(n_alphas=5, fit_intercept=True).fit(X, y)\r\nprint(est.alpha_)\r\nprint(est.mse_path_)\r\nprint(est.coef_)\r\nprint(est.intercept_)\r\n```\r\nwhich returns:\r\n```\r\n0.0012801092295924427\r\n[[7.79350312e-01 9.01338896e-01 9.76488985e-01]\r\n [2.46452208e-02 2.85028386e-02 3.34510373e-02]\r\n [7.79350312e-04 9.01338896e-04 1.05781468e-03]\r\n [2.46452208e-05 2.85028386e-05 3.34510373e-05]\r\n [7.79350312e-07 9.01338896e-07 1.05781468e-06]]\r\n[[ 0.999  0.    -0.   ]\r\n [ 0.999  0.    -0.   ]]\r\n[2.72463186e-06 2.72463186e-06]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso weirdly if I set `fit_intercept=False`, then things are good even with binary features:\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import MultiTaskLassoCV, LassoCV\r\nnp.random.seed(123)\r\nn = 1000\r\nd = 3\r\nX = np.random.binomial(1, .5, size=(n, d))\r\ny = X[:, [0, 0]].copy()\r\nest = MultiTaskLassoCV(n_alphas=5, fit_intercept=False).fit(X, y)\r\nprint(est.alpha_)\r\nprint(est.mse_path_)\r\nprint(est.coef_)\r\nprint(est.intercept_)\r\n```\r\nwhich returns\r\n```\r\n0.0007014499269370555\r\n[[5.05988024e-01 4.83136584e-01 4.89033340e-01]\r\n [1.63288855e-02 1.52781203e-02 1.54645920e-02]\r\n [5.16364698e-04 4.83136584e-04 4.89033340e-04]\r\n [1.63288855e-05 1.52781203e-05 1.54645920e-05]\r\n [5.16364698e-07 4.83136584e-07 4.89033340e-07]]\r\n[[0.999 0.    0.   ]\r\n [0.999 0.    0.   ]]\r\n0.0\r\n```\r\n\n",

But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nBased on the issue description and the code snippets provided, the solution to the issue with `MultiTaskLassoCV` and `MultiTaskElasticNet` when using binary features and `fit_intercept=True` is as follows:\n\n- Ensure that the data is properly centered if `fit_intercept=False` is used. This means subtracting the mean from each feature in the dataset so that the data is centered around zero. If `fit_intercept=True`, the models should automatically handle the intercept.\n- Verify that the binary features are correctly formatted as 0 and 1, and not as -1 and 1 or any other format.\n- Check if the issue persists when setting a different random seed or when using a different number of alphas (`n_alphas`) in the cross-validation process.\n- If the issue is specific to `MultiTaskLassoCV` and `MultiTaskElasticNet` and does not occur with `LassoCV`, compare the implementation of the `fit` method in these classes to ensure that they are handling binary features in the same way.\n- Since the issue does not occur with normal features generated by `np.random.normal`, it might be related to the scale or distribution of the binary features. Consider standardizing the features before fitting the model.\n- If the problem is related to the selection of `alpha_` during cross-validation, investigate the `mse_path_` attribute to understand how the mean squared error varies with different values of `alpha` and adjust the range of `alpha` values being tested.\n- Review the `fit` method implementation in the `_coordinate_descent.py` file for both `MultiTaskLassoCV` and `MultiTaskElasticNet` to ensure that the binary features and intercept are being handled correctly during the optimization process.\n- If the issue is caused by a bug in the scikit-learn version being used (0.21.3), consider upgrading to a newer version where the bug might have been fixed.\n\nRemember to test the changes with a dataset containing binary features to confirm that the issue has been resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [linear_model](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/linear_model)- [Lines 2473 - 3083](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/linear_model/_coordinate_descent.py#L2473-L3083)\n\n This snippet contains the definition and parameters for the MultiTaskLassoCV class, which is directly related to the issue reported. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2615 - 2728](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/linear_model/_coordinate_descent.py#L2615-L2728)\n\n This snippet contains the definition and parameters for the MultiTaskElasticNetCV class, which is also mentioned in the issue as having the same problem as MultiTaskLassoCV.",

This means subtracting the mean from each feature in the dataset so that the data is centered around zero. If `fit_intercept=True`, the models should automatically handle the intercept.\n- Verify that the binary features are correctly formatted as 0 and 1, and not as -1 and 1 or any other format.\n- Check if the issue persists when setting a different random seed or when using a different number of alphas (`n_alphas`) in the cross-validation process.\n- If the issue is specific to `MultiTaskLassoCV` and `MultiTaskElasticNet` and does not occur with `LassoCV`, compare the implementation of the `fit` method in these classes to ensure that they are handling binary features in the same way.\n- Since the issue does not occur with normal features generated by `np.random.normal`, it might be related to the scale or distribution of the binary features. Consider standardizing the features before fitting the model.\n- If the problem is related to the selection of `alpha_` during cross-validation, investigate the `mse_path_` attribute to understand how the mean squared error varies with different values of `alpha` and adjust the range of `alpha` values being tested.\n- Review the `fit` method implementation in the `_coordinate_descent.py` file for both `MultiTaskLassoCV` and `MultiTaskElasticNet` to ensure that the binary features and intercept are being handled correctly during the optimization process.\n- If the issue is caused by a bug in the scikit-learn version being used (0.21.3), consider upgrading to a newer version where the bug might have been fixed.\n\nRemember to test the changes with a dataset containing binary features to confirm that the issue has been resolved.",

The suggestions to ensure proper data centering, verify binary feature formatting, change the random seed, compare implementations, and standardize features are general good practices but do not offer a direct solution to the described bug. The RESPONSE also suggests reviewing the `fit` method implementation and considering an upgrade of the scikit-learn version, which are more relevant but still not directly actionable without further investigation.
