    "mayil_response": "- Modify the `solvify` function in the `sympy/solvers/solveset.py` file to return a `ConditionSet` instead of raising `NotImplementedError` when it encounters a `ConditionSet` as the solution.\n- Replace the following lines in the `solvify` function:\n  ```python\n  elif isinstance(solution_set, ConditionSet):\n      raise NotImplementedError('solveset is unable to solve this equation.')\n  ```\n  with:\n  ```python\n  elif isinstance(solution_set, ConditionSet):\n      return solution_set\n  ```\n- Ensure that the domain is correctly passed to the `ConditionSet` when it is returned. If the domain is not explicitly handled, modify the `_return_conditionset` function to accept a domain parameter and pass the correct domain when creating a `ConditionSet`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [solvers](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/solvers)- [Lines 2192 - 2635](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/solvers/solveset.py#L2192-L2635)\n\n This snippet defines a function that returns a ConditionSet, which is the expected behavior for the issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2111 - 2194](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/solvers/solveset.py#L2111-L2194)\n\n This snippet contains the solvify function which raises NotImplementedError when it encounters a ConditionSet.
