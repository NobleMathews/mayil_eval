                "code": "\"\"\"\nImplementation of the trigsimp algorithm by Fu et al.\n\nThe idea behind the ``fu`` algorithm is to use a sequence of rules, applied\nin what is heuristically known to be a smart order, to select a simpler\nexpression that is equivalent to the input.\n\nThere are transform rules in which a single rule is applied to the\nexpression tree. The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\ndocstrings for examples.\n\n    TR0 - simplify expression\n    TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    TR4 - functions at special angles\n    TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    TR11 - reduce double angles\n    TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n\nThere are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\ntransformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\na few options.\n\nFinally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\nsequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\nalgorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\nbest expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\nof trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n\nOther than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\ne.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\ntraversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\nattempted. For example,\n\n    Set-up for examples below:\n\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    >>> from time import time\n\n>>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n>>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n-sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n\nIf the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\nthe transformation is successful:\n\n>>> TR10i(_.normal())\ncos(x + y)/cos(x)\n\nTR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\ndoesn't do any simplification of the result.\n\n>>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n(2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n>>> powsimp(_)\n(2*sin(1))**a\n\nThe temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\nbe done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\nwell\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\nrecognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n\n>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\na*cos(x - y)\n\nFactoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\nuntil it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\nhelp with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n(but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n\n>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\na*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n\nIn some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\nto make that decision. For example:\n\n>>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n\nIn the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n\n>>> L(expr)\n932\n\nIf the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\nresulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n\n>>> def clock(f, n=2):\n...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n...\n>>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n0.86\n>>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n0.016\n\nIf the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\nnot as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n\n>>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n0.28\n\nSo neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\nexpression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\nwith ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\nlonger; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\nsimply applying the transformation itself.\n\nAlthough the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\nresult, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\nthe nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\npaths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\nin the following sum:\n\n>>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n... cos(y)*cos(z))\n>>> args = expr.args\n\nSerendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n\n>>> fu(expr)\n3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n\nBut if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\nobtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\nbut still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\nof ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\nis taken since it leads to a dead end:\n\n>>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\nsin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n\nHere is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n\n>>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n>>> TR10i(a)\nsin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n>>> newa = _\n>>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\nsin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n>>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\nTrue\n\nWithout getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\nfinal result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\nbetter heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nThis work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n\"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nFu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\nsimplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\nmodelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\nhttp://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n\nhttp://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n\n\"\"\"",

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\ndocstrings for examples.\n\n    TR0 - simplify expression\n    TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n    TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n    TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n    TR3 - angle canonicalization\n    TR4 - functions at special angles\n    TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n    TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n    TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n    TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n    TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n    TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n    TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n    TR11 - reduce double angles\n    TR12 - separate tan arguments\n    TR12i - collect tan arguments\n    TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n    TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n    TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n    TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n    TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n    TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n    TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n\nThere are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\ntransformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\na few options.\n\nFinally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\nsequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\nalgorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\nbest expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\nof trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n\nOther than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\ne.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\ntraversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\nattempted. For example,\n\n    Set-up for examples below:\n\n    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n    >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n    >>> from time import time\n\n>>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n>>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n-sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n\nIf the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\nthe transformation is successful:\n\n>>> TR10i(_.normal())\ncos(x + y)/cos(x)\n\nTR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\ndoesn't do any simplification of the result.\n\n>>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n(2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n>>> powsimp(_)\n(2*sin(1))**a\n\nThe temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\nbe done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\nwell\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\nrecognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n\n>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\na*cos(x - y)\n\nFactoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\nuntil it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\nhelp with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n(but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n\n>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\na*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n\nIn some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\nto make that decision. For example:\n\n>>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n\nIn the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n\n>>> L(expr)\n932\n\nIf the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\nresulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n\n>>> def clock(f, n=2):\n...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n...\n>>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n0.86\n>>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n0.016\n\nIf the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\nnot as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n\n>>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n0.28\n\nSo neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\nexpression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\nwith ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\nlonger; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\nsimply applying the transformation itself.\n\nAlthough the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\nresult, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\nthe nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\npaths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\nin the following sum:\n\n>>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n... cos(y)*cos(z))\n>>> args = expr.args\n\nSerendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n\n>>> fu(expr)\n3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n\nBut if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\nobtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\nbut still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\nof ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\nis taken since it leads to a dead end:\n\n>>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\nsin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n\nHere is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n\n>>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n>>> TR10i(a)\nsin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n>>> newa = _\n>>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\nsin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n>>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\nTrue\n\nWithout getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\nfinal result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\nbetter heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n\nNotes\n=====\n\nThis work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n\"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nFu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\nsimplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\nmodelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\nhttp://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n\nhttp://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n\n\"\"\"",

There are two practical problems:\n    #   (1) The ideal has to be *prime* (a technical term).\n    #   (2) The relations have to be polynomials in the generators.\n    #\n    # We typically have two kinds of generators:\n    # - trigonometric expressions, like sin(x), cos(5*x), etc\n    # - \"everything else\", like gamma(x), pi, etc.\n    #\n    # Since this function is trigsimp, we will concentrate on what to do with\n    # trigonometric expressions. We can also simplify hyperbolic expressions,\n    # but the extensions should be clear.\n    #\n    # One crucial point is that all *other* generators really should behave\n    # like indeterminates. In particular if (say) \"I\" is one of them, then\n    # in fact I**2 + 1 = 0 and we may and will compute non-sensical\n    # expressions. However, we can work with a dummy and add the relation\n    # I**2 + 1 = 0 to our ideal, then substitute back in the end.\n    #\n    # Now regarding trigonometric generators. We split them into groups,\n    # according to the argument of the trigonometric functions. We want to\n    # organise this in such a way that most trigonometric identities apply in\n    # the same group. For example, given sin(x), cos(2*x) and cos(y), we would\n    # group as [sin(x), cos(2*x)] and [cos(y)].\n    #\n    # Our prime ideal will be built in three steps:\n    # (1) For each group, compute a \"geometrically prime\" ideal of relations.\n    #     Geometrically prime means that it generates a prime ideal in\n    #     CC[gens], not just ZZ[gens].\n    # (2) Take the union of all the generators of the ideals for all groups.\n    #     By the geometric primality condition, this is still prime.\n    # (3) Add further inter-group relations which preserve primality.\n    #",
