    "mayil_response": "- Identify the migration file that contains the `RenameModel` operation for `Rubrictype` to `RubricType` or `RubricXype`. If it does not exist, create a new migration file with the `RenameModel` operation.\n- In the new migration file, add a `RenameModel` operation before any `AlterField` operations that reference the `Rubrictype` model. The operation should look like this:\n  ```python\n  operations = [\n      migrations.RenameModel(\n          old_name='Rubrictype',\n          new_name='RubricType',\n      ),\n      # ... other operations ...\n  ]\n  ```\n- Ensure that the `dependencies` list in the new migration file includes the last migration file before the rename operation.\n- Update any `ForeignKey` references in the migration files that follow the `RenameModel` operation to use the new model name `RubricType`.\n- If there are any `AlterField` operations referencing the old `Rubrictype` model in subsequent migration files, update them to reference `RubricType`.\n- After making these changes, run `./manage.py makemigrations` again to check if the issue is resolved. If there are no errors, run `./manage.py migrate` to apply the migrations.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 522 - 977](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L522-L977)\n\n This snippet contains logic for detecting model renames, which is relevant to the issue of Django not detecting case changes in model names. \n\n\n   - [Lines 921 - 977](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L921-L977)\n\n This snippet is part of the autodetector logic that handles field renames and may be relevant for understanding how model renames are detected or missed.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 98 - 525](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/models.py#L98-L525)\n\n This snippet includes the RenameModel operation, which is directly related to the issue of renaming models and the case sensitivity problem described.",
