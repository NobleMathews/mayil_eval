    "title": "KeyError when trying to migrate backward to a replaced migration",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nDjango exhibits some internal confusion regarding whether replaced migrations exist or not. Consider this simple app with two migrations and squashed migration replacing both:\n$ ls testproj/migrations/\n0001_initial.py 0001_squashed_0002_thing_age.py 0002_thing_age.py __init__.py\nWhen it comes to disambiguating input, Django seems to believe that the replaced migrations still need to be considered:\n$ ./manage.py migrate testproj 0001\nCommandError: More than one migration matches '0001' in app 'testproj'. Please be more specific.\nBut if you actually try to disambiguate and specify one of the replaced migrations, Django no longer thinks it exists (and isn't very graceful about telling you so):\n$ ./manage.py migrate testproj 0001_initial\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"./manage.py\", line 10, in <module>\n\texecute_from_command_line(sys.argv)\n File \"/home/carljm/projects/django/django/django/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 330, in execute_from_command_line\n\tutility.execute()\n File \"/home/carljm/projects/django/django/django/django/core/management/__init__.py\", line 322, in execute\n\tself.fetch_command(subcommand).run_from_argv(self.argv)\n File \"/home/carljm/projects/django/django/django/django/core/management/base.py\", line 347, in run_from_argv\n\tself.execute(*args, **cmd_options)\n File \"/home/carljm/projects/django/django/django/django/core/management/base.py\", line 398, in execute\n\toutput = self.handle(*args, **options)\n File \"/home/carljm/projects/django/django/django/django/core/management/commands/migrate.py\", line 135, in handle\n\tplan = executor.migration_plan(targets)\n File \"/home/carljm/projects/django/django/django/django/db/migrations/executor.py\", line 50, in migration_plan\n\tself.loader.graph.node_map[target].children\nKeyError: ('testproj', '0001_initial')\nThere could be several different approaches to fixing this, but my feeling is that Django shouldn't prevent you from migrating to a replaced migration. If a migration still exists on disk, even if it's been squashed and you've fully migrated the squashed set, you should be able to migrate back to a state within the squashed set. It seems like there might be production rollback cases where that could be important, and I don't see in principle why it shouldn't be possible.\nIf that turns out to be impractical, then I think Django oughtn't bother you about resolving ambiguities with migration names it won't let you migrate to anyway. And the \"nonexistent\" error for this case should be nicer than a raw KeyError. (In Django 1.7 the error was \"ValueError: Node ('testproj17', '0001_initial') not a valid node\", which is perhaps a bit better, but not much.)\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Update the `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file to include a more descriptive error message when a `KeyError` is encountered due to a missing migration node.\n- Modify the `MigrationLoader` class to catch `KeyError` exceptions when accessing `self.loader.graph.node_map[target]`.\n- Raise a custom `NodeNotFoundError` with a message that includes the missing migration's app label and name, and suggests checking for typos or a missing migration file.\n- Example modification in `django/db/migrations/loader.py`:\n\n```python\n# In the MigrationLoader class, find the method that accesses self.loader.graph.node_map[target]\n# and wrap it in a try-except block to catch KeyError.\n\ntry:\n    # Existing code that accesses the node_map\n    node = self.loader.graph.node_map[target]\n    # ... rest of the code that uses the node\nexcept KeyError:\n    # Raise a more descriptive error message\n    raise NodeNotFoundError(\n        \"Migration '{}' for app '{}' not found.
