    "title": "Change automatic migration naming from date-based to operation-based",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nFollowing #31468 and a \u200bdiscussion on django-developers with broad consensus, change the way migrations are automatically named from date-based to operation-based. That is never name migrations based upon the current date (auto_YYYYMMDD) and instead always based on the operations they contain, rather than the current behaviour which uses either style.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature request to change automatic migration naming from date-based to operation-based in Django, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `suggest_name` method in `django/db/migrations/migration.py` to generate a name based on the operations contained in the migration rather than using the current date.\n- Ensure that each operation class in `django/db/migrations/operations/` has a `migration_name_fragment` property that returns a string fragment representing the operation.\n- Update the `suggest_name` method to concatenate these fragments to form the migration name.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes needed:\n\n1. Update the `migration_name_fragment` property in each operation class to return a meaningful string fragment.\n2. Modify the `suggest_name` method in `migration.py` to use these fragments.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how the `suggest_name` method could be modified:\n\n```python\n# django/db/migrations/migration.py\n\ndef suggest_name(self):\n    if self.initial:\n        return \"initial\"\n\n    fragments = [op.migration_name_fragment for op in self.operations if op.migration_name_fragment]\n    if not fragments:\n        return \"auto_%s\" % get_migration_name_timestamp()\n\n    name = \"_\".join(fragments)\n    if len(name) > 50:  # Assuming a max length of 50 characters for migration names\n        name = name[:47] + \"...\"  # Truncate and append ellipsis\n\n    return name\n```\n\nRemember to handle cases where the generated name might exceed a certain length, and ensure that the name is unique and valid as a filename.\n\nThis is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may require more detailed changes, including handling edge cases and ensuring backward compatibility. Additionally, you may need to write tests to cover the new naming behavior.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 200 - 222](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/migration.py#L200-L222)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for suggesting migration names, which is directly related to the issue of changing migration naming from date-based to operation-based.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 784 - 873](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/models.py#L784-L873)\n\n This snippet defines operations with a property 'migration_name_fragment' that is used to generate operation-based names for migrations, which is relevant to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 5 - 86](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/base.py#L5-L86)\n\n This snippet defines the base class for migration operations, which might need to be reviewed to ensure that the new naming convention is applied consistently across all types of operations. \n\n\n   - [Lines 88 - 146](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/base.py#L88-L146)\n\n This snippet includes the 'migration_name_fragment' property, which returns None by default.

Update the `migration_name_fragment` property in each operation class to return a meaningful string fragment.\n2. Modify the `suggest_name` method in `migration.py` to use these fragments.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how the `suggest_name` method could be modified:\n\n```python\n# django/db/migrations/migration.py\n\ndef suggest_name(self):\n    if self.initial:\n        return \"initial\"\n\n    fragments = [op.migration_name_fragment for op in self.operations if op.migration_name_fragment]\n    if not fragments:\n        return \"auto_%s\" % get_migration_name_timestamp()\n\n    name = \"_\".join(fragments)\n    if len(name) > 50:  # Assuming a max length of 50 characters for migration names\n        name = name[:47] + \"...\"  # Truncate and append ellipsis\n\n    return name\n```\n\nRemember to handle cases where the generated name might exceed a certain length, and ensure that the name is unique and valid as a filename.\n\nThis is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may require more detailed changes, including handling edge cases and ensuring backward compatibility. Additionally, you may need to write tests to cover the new naming behavior.",

        "result": "To implement the feature request to change automatic migration naming from date-based to operation-based in Django, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `suggest_name` method in `django/db/migrations/migration.py` to generate a name based on the operations contained in the migration rather than using the current date.\n- Ensure that each operation class in `django/db/migrations/operations/` has a `migration_name_fragment` property that returns a string fragment representing the operation.\n- Update the `suggest_name` method to concatenate these fragments to form the migration name.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes needed:\n\n1. Update the `migration_name_fragment` property in each operation class to return a meaningful string fragment.\n2. Modify the `suggest_name` method in `migration.py` to use these fragments.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how the `suggest_name` method could be modified:\n\n```python\n# django/db/migrations/migration.py\n\ndef suggest_name(self):\n    if self.initial:\n        return \"initial\"\n\n    fragments = [op.migration_name_fragment for op in self.operations if op.migration_name_fragment]\n    if not fragments:\n        return \"auto_%s\" % get_migration_name_timestamp()\n\n    name = \"_\".join(fragments)\n    if len(name) > 50:  # Assuming a max length of 50 characters for migration names\n        name = name[:47] + \"...\"  # Truncate and append ellipsis\n\n    return name\n```\n\nRemember to handle cases where the generated name might exceed a certain length, and ensure that the name is unique and valid as a filename.\n\nThis is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may require more detailed changes, including handling edge cases and ensuring backward compatibility. Additionally, you may need to write tests to cover the new naming behavior.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 200 - 222](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/migration.py#L200-L222)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for suggesting migration names, which is directly related to the issue of changing migration naming from date-based to operation-based.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 784 - 873](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/models.py#L784-L873)\n\n This snippet defines operations with a property 'migration_name_fragment' that is used to generate operation-based names for migrations, which is relevant to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 5 - 86](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/base.py#L5-L86)\n\n This snippet defines the base class for migration operations, which might need to be reviewed to ensure that the new naming convention is applied consistently across all types of operations. \n\n\n   - [Lines 88 - 146](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/base.py#L88-L146)\n\n This snippet includes the 'migration_name_fragment' property, which returns None by default.
