    "body": "Description\n\t\nTo update a complete list of foreignkeys, we use set() method of relatedmanager to get a performance gain and avoid remove and add keys not touched by user.\nBut today i noticed our database removes all foreignkeys and adds them again. After some debugging i found the issue in this condition:\n\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L1004\nOur form returns all Foreignkeys as list of strings in cleaned_data, but the strings do not match the pk (int). After converting the strings to int, before calling set(), fixes the problem.\nQuestion:\nHow to avoid this issue? Maybe all code usages of set() are using lists of strings, maybe not. I dont know at the moment.\nIs is possible Django fixes this issue? Should Django fix the issue? Maybe strings should raise an exception?\n",

    "mayil_response": "To address the issue described in the ticket, you can implement a solution that ensures the `set()` method of the `RelatedManager` in Django properly handles foreign keys provided as strings by converting them to the appropriate type before performing operations. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can take:\n\n- Create a custom `RelatedManager` that overrides the `set()` method.\n- In the overridden `set()` method, convert the list of foreign key strings to the correct type (e.g., integers if the primary keys are integers).\n- Use the custom `RelatedManager` in your models where necessary.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass CustomRelatedManager(models.Manager):\n    def set(self, objs, *, bulk=True, clear=False):\n        # Convert string representations of primary keys to integers\n        objs = [int(obj) if isinstance(obj, str) else obj for obj in objs]\n        # Call the original set method with the converted objects\n        super().set(objs, bulk=bulk, clear=clear)\n\nclass YourModel(models.Model):\n    # Your fields here\n\n    # Use the custom manager for the related field\n    related_field = models.ForeignKey(RelatedModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    related_field.related_manager_cls = CustomRelatedManager\n```\n\nRegarding whether Django should fix the issue or if strings should raise an exception, it's a matter of design choice and backward compatibility. It could be argued that Django should handle this more gracefully, either by automatically converting the values or by providing a clearer error message. However, this change would need to be proposed and discussed with the Django community, possibly leading to a change in the Django framework itself.\n\nFor now, implementing a custom solution like the one above is a practical way to work around the issue in your project.",

Here's a high-level overview of the steps you can take:\n\n- Create a custom `RelatedManager` that overrides the `set()` method.\n- In the overridden `set()` method, convert the list of foreign key strings to the correct type (e.g., integers if the primary keys are integers).\n- Use the custom `RelatedManager` in your models where necessary.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass CustomRelatedManager(models.Manager):\n    def set(self, objs, *, bulk=True, clear=False):\n        # Convert string representations of primary keys to integers\n        objs = [int(obj) if isinstance(obj, str) else obj for obj in objs]\n        # Call the original set method with the converted objects\n        super().set(objs, bulk=bulk, clear=clear)\n\nclass YourModel(models.Model):\n    # Your fields here\n\n    # Use the custom manager for the related field\n    related_field = models.ForeignKey(RelatedModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    related_field.related_manager_cls = CustomRelatedManager\n```\n\nRegarding whether Django should fix the issue or if strings should raise an exception, it's a matter of design choice and backward compatibility. It could be argued that Django should handle this more gracefully, either by automatically converting the values or by providing a clearer error message. However, this change would need to be proposed and discussed with the Django community, possibly leading to a change in the Django framework itself.\n\nFor now, implementing a custom solution like the one above is a practical way to work around the issue in your project.",
