    "body": "Description\n\t\nSince deleting objects deletes related objects, it would be good to know the origin of the delete. \nIt lets the signal listeners know why an object is being delete. If it's deleted from a model.delete(), you know which instance initiated the delete and if it's from a queryset.delete() you know which queryset initiated the delete, with the models in that queryset. Using this you know if the instance is being deleted directly or because it's related to another instance.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of knowing where an object was deleted from (either from a direct `model.delete()` call or from a `queryset.delete()`), you can modify the `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals to include additional context about the origin of the deletion. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you would take:\n\n- Modify the `Collector` class in `django/db/models/deletion.py` to accept and store the origin of the delete operation.\n- Update the `delete()` method of the `Collector` class to pass this origin information to the `pre_delete` and `post_delete` signals.\n- Ensure that the origin information is passed through all the layers that lead to the actual deletion, including the `delete()` methods on models and querysets.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Modify the `Collector` class to store the origin:\n   ```python\n   class Collector:\n       def __init__(self, using, origin=None):\n           # ... existing code ...\n           self.origin = origin  # Add this line to store the origin\n   ```\n\n2. Update the `delete()` method in `Collector` to send the origin with the signals:\n   ```python\n   for model, obj in self.instances_with_model():\n       if not model._meta.auto_created:\n           signals.pre_delete.send(\n               sender=model,\n               instance=obj,\n               using=self.using,\n               origin=self.origin,  # Add the origin here\n           )\n   # ... code for deletion ...\n   for model, obj in self.instances_with_model():\n       if not model._meta.auto_created:\n           signals.post_delete.send(\n               sender=model,\n               instance=obj,\n               using=self.using,\n               origin=self.origin,  # Add the origin here\n           )\n   ```\n\n3. Modify the `delete()` method on models and querysets to pass the origin to the `Collector`:\n   - For `model.delete()`:\n     ```python\n     def delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False):\n         # ... existing code ...\n         collector = Collector(using=using, origin=self)  # Pass self as the origin\n         collector.collect([self], keep_parents=keep_parents)\n         # ... existing code ...\n     ```\n   - For `queryset.delete()`:\n     ```python\n     def delete(self):\n         # ... existing code ...\n         collector = Collector(using=self.db, origin=self)  # Pass self as the origin\n         collector.collect(queryset, keep_parents=keep_parents)\n         # ... existing code ...\n     ```\n\n4. Update signal handlers that listen to `pre_delete` and `post_delete` to handle the new `origin` parameter.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to pass the origin of the delete operation to the signal listeners, allowing them to know whether an object is being deleted directly or because it's related to another instance.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 97 - 160](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/deletion.py#L97-L160)\n\n This snippet initializes the deletion collector with an 'origin' parameter, which is relevant to tracking the origin of the delete. \n\n\n   - [Lines 459 - 522](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/deletion.py#L459-L522)\n\n This snippet shows where the pre_delete and post_delete signals are sent, and includes the 'origin' parameter, which is relevant to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1 - 54](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/signals.py#L1-L54)\n\n This snippet defines the pre_delete and post_delete signals, which are relevant to the issue as we may need to modify them to include information about the origin of the delete.",
