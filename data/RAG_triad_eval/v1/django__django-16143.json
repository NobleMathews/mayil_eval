You can't execute queries until the end of the 'atomic' block.\" thrown from django/db/backends/init.py\", line 372, in validate_no_broken_transaction doesn't provide enough information to help track down the problem.\nThe exception is thrown if self.needs_rollback is True, but the underlying reason that self.needs_rollback has been set True has been lost, since it could have happened a long time previously.\nTransactions should keep track of why needs_rollback has been set, and use that to provide a more helpful error.\nBackground: I'm seeing this error being thrown when a task is run on a Celery queue, but not when run manually. Since it's via Celery, dropping into the debugger is impossible, and thus I'm back to trying to dump useful debug info.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Ensure that the database operations within the Celery task are wrapped in an `atomic` block to manage transactions properly.\n- Check for any unhandled exceptions within the Celery task that might be causing the transaction to be marked for rollback (`needs_rollback = True`).\n- Use `try...except` blocks around database operations to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately, possibly using `transaction.rollback()` if needed.\n- If the task involves multiple database operations that must be committed together, ensure they are all within the same `atomic` block.\n- If the task is part of a chain or group of tasks in Celery, ensure that the database transaction is not being shared across tasks unintentionally, as this can lead to transaction management errors.\n- If the error occurs intermittently, consider adding logging around the transaction management to capture more context when the error occurs.\n- Review the task code for any manual setting of `connection.needs_rollback` to `True` without a subsequent rollback or commit, and correct the logic as needed.\n- If using savepoints, ensure that `savepoint_rollback` is called if an exception occurs after a savepoint has been created.\n- If the task is performing database operations that are not idempotent, consider using the `on_commit` hook to defer execution of those operations until after the transaction has been successfully committed.\n- Verify that the database connection is not being closed or marked as needing rollback due to an error in a different part of the code that is executed before the task runs.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/db)- [Lines 100 - 139](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L100-L139)\n\n This snippet shows where the 'needs_rollback' flag is set and an exception is stored, which is directly related to the issue of tracking down the cause of a TransactionManagementError. \n\n\n   - [Lines 113 - 299](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L113-L299)\n\n This snippet includes logic for setting 'needs_rollback' to True and handling savepoints, which is relevant to understanding when and why transactions are marked for rollback. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 97](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L1-L97)\n\n This snippet defines the TransactionManagementError and functions related to transaction management, which may need to be modified to include more information about the cause of the error. \n\n\n   - [Lines 237 - 271](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L237-L271)\n\n This snippet contains logic for committing transactions and handling exceptions, which could be relevant for understanding how exceptions are handled in successful transactions. \n\n\n   - [Lines 182 - 222](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L182-L222)\n\n This snippet shows the logic for entering an atomic block and handling savepoints, which is relevant to the issue of tracking transaction states and errors.",
