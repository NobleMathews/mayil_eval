    "title": "Make pylint XDG Base Directory Specification compliant",
    "body": "I have this really annoying `.pylint.d` directory in my home folder. From what I can tell (I don't do C or C++), this directory is storing data. \r\n\r\nThe problem with this is, quite simply, that data storage has a designated spot. The `$HOME/.local/share/<PROGRAM_NAME>` folder. This is a part of the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). A system that designates the folders for specific things like cached files (`$HOME/.cache/<PROGRAM_NAME>`), configuration files (`$HOME/.config/<PROGRAM_NAME>`), and data files (`$HOME/.local/share/<PROGRAM_NAME>`), among other things. The point is to keep user home directories clean and the user sane. \r\n\r\nThis should be pretty easy to implement. Simply change the variables/constants for where these files are made and stored to the appropriate directory. Simple as that, even for a large codebase (if it was done right). \n",

    "mayil_response": "To make pylint XDG Base Directory Specification compliant, you will need to modify the way pylint determines its home directory for storing data. Here's how you can implement this feature:\n\n- Modify the `DEFAULT_PYLINT_HOME` constant in `pylint/constants.py` to use the appropriate XDG directory for data storage.\n- Use `platformdirs.user_data_dir()` instead of `platformdirs.user_cache_dir()` to comply with the XDG specification for data files.\n\nHere's a code snippet that demonstrates the changes:\n\n```python\n# pylint/constants.py\n\n# ... (other imports)\nfrom platformdirs import user_data_dir\n\n# ... (other constants)\n\n# Change this line to comply with XDG Base Directory Specification\nDEFAULT_PYLINT_HOME = user_data_dir(\"pylint\", appauthor=False)\n\n# ... (rest of the file)\n```\n\n- Update any other references to `PYLINT_HOME` throughout the codebase to ensure they point to the new default location.\n- Ensure that the `_get_pylint_home()` function in `pylint/constants.py` and any other relevant functions in other modules (like `pylint/lint/caching.py`) are updated to use the new `DEFAULT_PYLINT_HOME`.\n- Test the changes to ensure pylint still functions correctly and that data files are now stored in the correct XDG-compliant directory.\n- Update documentation and any user-facing messages to reflect the new directory structure.\n- Consider implementing a migration strategy for users who upgrade pylint and have existing data in the old location. This could involve checking the old location for existing data and moving it to the new location.\n\nRemember to follow the contribution guidelines of pylint when making these changes, including writing tests and updating the changelog.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.10/tree//pylint)- [Lines 1 - 107](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.10/blob//pylint/constants.py#L1-L107)\n\n This snippet defines the DEFAULT_PYLINT_HOME constant and the _get_pylint_home function which determines the location of the pylint data directory. It is directly related to the issue as it needs to be modified to comply with the XDG Base Directory Specification.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.10/tree//pylint) \u2192 [lint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.10/tree//pylint/lint)- [Lines 1 - 71](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.10/blob//pylint/lint/caching.py#L1-L71)\n\n This snippet includes the use of PYLINT_HOME for caching purposes. It is relevant because changes to the data directory location in snippet #1 will affect how caching works, and this code will need to be reviewed to ensure it complies with the new directory structure.",
