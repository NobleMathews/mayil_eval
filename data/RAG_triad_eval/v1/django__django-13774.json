    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Dennis Kliban)\n\t \nOur project processes instances in a stream. In some cases the instances are repeated. In these cases, we discovered that prefetch_related_objects() does not set the to_attr on all of the instances if the first instance in the list already has it set.\nWhen Django determines that the very first instance in the list is_fetched[0], it does not call into the the prefetch_one_level()[1]. The attributed specified in the to_attr parameter is only set in the prefetch_one_level() method[2].\nis_fetched is set by looking for the to_attr attribute on the instance[3].\n[0] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/db/models/query.py#L1605-L1609\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/db/models/query.py#L1624\n[2] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/db/models/query.py#L1799\n[3] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.2.x/django/db/models/query.py#L1708\n",
