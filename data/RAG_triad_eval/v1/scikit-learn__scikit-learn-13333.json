    "title": "DOC Improve doc of n_quantiles in QuantileTransformer ",
    "body": "#### Description\r\nThe `QuantileTransformer` uses numpy.percentile(X_train, .) as the estimator of the quantile function of the training data. To know this function perfectly we just need to take `n_quantiles=n_samples`. Then it is just a linear interpolation (which is done in the code afterwards). Therefore I don't think we should be able to choose `n_quantiles > n_samples` and we should prevent users from thinking that the higher `n_quantiles` the better the transformation. As mentioned by @GaelVaroquaux IRL it is however true that it can be relevant to choose `n_quantiles < n_samples` when `n_samples` is very large.\r\n\r\nI suggest to add more information on the impact of `n_quantiles` in the doc which currently reads:\r\n```python\r\nNumber of quantiles to be computed. It corresponds to the number of\r\nlandmarks used to discretize the cumulative distribution function.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example using 100 times more landmarks result in the same transformation\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer\r\nfrom sklearn.utils.testing import assert_allclose\r\n\r\nn_samples = 100\r\nX_train = np.random.randn(n_samples, 2)\r\nX_test = np.random.randn(1000, 2)\r\n\r\nqf_1 = QuantileTransformer(n_quantiles=n_samples)\r\nqf_1.fit(X_train)\r\nX_trans_1 = qf_1.transform(X_test)\r\n\r\nqf_2 = QuantileTransformer(n_quantiles=10000)\r\nqf_2.fit(X_train)\r\nX_trans_2 = qf_2.transform(X_test)\r\n\r\nassert_allclose(X_trans_1, X_trans_2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly if you do not choose `n_quantiles > n_samples` correctly, the linear interpolation done afterwards does not correspond to the numpy.percentile(X_train, .) estimator. This is not \"wrong\" as these are only estimators of the true quantile function/cdf but I think it is confusing and would be better to stick with the original estimator. For instance, the following raises an AssertionError.\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer\r\nfrom sklearn.utils.testing import assert_allclose\r\n\r\nn_samples = 100\r\nX_train = np.random.randn(n_samples, 2)\r\nX_test = np.random.randn(1000, 2)\r\n\r\nqf_1 = QuantileTransformer(n_quantiles=n_samples)\r\nqf_1.fit(X_train)\r\nX_trans_1 = qf_1.transform(X_test)\r\n\r\nqf_2 = QuantileTransformer(n_quantiles=200)\r\nqf_2.fit(X_train)\r\nX_trans_2 = qf_2.transform(X_test)\r\n\r\nassert_allclose(X_trans_1, X_trans_2)\r\n```\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the requested feature, you should update the documentation of the `QuantileTransformer` class to provide more information about the impact of the `n_quantiles` parameter. Specifically, you should clarify that setting `n_quantiles` greater than the number of samples does not improve the transformation and that it is reasonable to choose `n_quantiles` less than `n_samples` when `n_samples` is very large.\n\nHere's how you can implement the feature:\n\n- Update the docstring of the `QuantileTransformer` class in the `_data.py` file.\n- Add a detailed explanation about the `n_quantiles` parameter, including the information provided in the feature request ticket.\n- Mention that choosing `n_quantiles` greater than `n_samples` is not beneficial and explain why.\n- Include an example or a note to demonstrate the effect of different `n_quantiles` values on the transformation.\n\nHere's a pseudo code snippet to illustrate the changes in the docstring:\n\n```python\nclass QuantileTransformer(OneToOneFeatureMixin, TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    \"\"\"Transform features using quantiles information.\n    \n    ...\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    n_quantiles : int, default=1000 or n_samples\n        Number of quantiles to be computed. It corresponds to the number\n        of landmarks used to discretize the cumulative distribution function.\n        If `n_quantiles` is larger than the number of samples, `n_quantiles` is set\n        to the number of samples as a larger number of quantiles does not give\n        a better approximation of the cumulative distribution function\n        estimator. When the number of samples is very large, it can be beneficial\n        to set `n_quantiles` to a smaller value for computational efficiency.\n        \n        Note: Setting `n_quantiles` greater than `n_samples` does not improve the\n        estimator of the quantile function. The transformation is based on a linear\n        interpolation of the quantiles, and having more quantiles than samples will\n        not result in a finer resolution of the cumulative distribution function.\n        It is recommended to avoid choosing `n_quantiles` significantly larger than\n        `n_samples` to prevent confusion and unnecessary computational cost.\n\n    ...\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n```\n\nMake sure to test the changes by building the documentation and verifying that the updated section is clear and correctly formatted.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [preprocessing](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/preprocessing)- [Lines 2425 - 3517](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/preprocessing/_data.py#L2425-L3517)\n\n This snippet contains the class definition and documentation for `QuantileTransformer`, which is directly related to the issue.
