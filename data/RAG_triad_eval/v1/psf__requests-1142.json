    "body": "Hi,\n\nIt seems like that request.get always adds 'content-length' header to the request.\nI think that the right behavior is not to add this header automatically in GET requests or add the possibility to not send it.\n\nFor example http://amazon.com returns 503 for every get request that contains 'content-length' header.\n\nThanks,\n\nOren\n\n",
