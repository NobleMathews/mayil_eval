In particular, it is a very efficient method to fit linear models.\n\nAs a stochastic method, the loss function is not necessarily decreasing at each\niteration, and convergence is only guaranteed in expectation. For this reason,\nmonitoring the convergence on the loss function can be difficult.\n\nAnother approach is to monitor convergence on a validation score. In this case,\nthe input data is split into a training set and a validation set. The model is\nthen fitted on the training set and the stopping criterion is based on the\nprediction score computed on the validation set. This enables us to find the\nleast number of iterations which is sufficient to build a model that\ngeneralizes well to unseen data and reduces the chance of over-fitting the\ntraining data.\n\nThis early stopping strategy is activated if ``early_stopping=True``; otherwise\nthe stopping criterion only uses the training loss on the entire input data. To\nbetter control the early stopping strategy, we can specify a parameter\n``validation_fraction`` which set the fraction of the input dataset that we\nkeep aside to compute the validation score. The optimization will continue\nuntil the validation score did not improve by at least ``tol`` during the last\n``n_iter_no_change`` iterations. The actual number of iterations is available\nat the attribute ``n_iter_``.\n\nThis example illustrates how the early stopping can used in the\n:class:`~sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier` model to achieve almost the same\naccuracy as compared to a model built without early stopping. This can\nsignificantly reduce training time. Note that scores differ between the\nstopping criteria even from early iterations because some of the training data\nis held out with the validation stopping criterion.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Authors: Tom Dupre la Tour\n#\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml\nfrom sklearn.exceptions import ConvergenceWarning\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.utils import shuffle\nfrom sklearn.utils._testing import ignore_warnings",

If the goal is to get the best\npredictive accuracy, it is better to use the non sparsity-inducing l2 penalty\ninstead.\n\nA more traditional (and possibly better) way to predict on a sparse subset of\ninput features would be to use univariate feature selection followed by a\ntraditional (l2-penalised) logistic regression model.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Author: Arthur Mensch\n\nimport timeit\nimport warnings\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized\nfrom sklearn.exceptions import ConvergenceWarning\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=ConvergenceWarning, module=\"sklearn\")\nt0 = timeit.default_timer()\n\n# We use SAGA solver\nsolver = \"saga\"\n\n# Turn down for faster run time\nn_samples = 5000\n\nX, y = fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized(subset=\"all\", return_X_y=True)\nX = X[:n_samples]\ny = y[:n_samples]\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    X, y, random_state=42, stratify=y, test_size=0.1\n)\ntrain_samples, n_features = X_train.shape\nn_classes = np.unique(y).shape[0]\n\nprint(\n    \"Dataset 20newsgroup, train_samples=%i, n_features=%i, n_classes=%i\"\n    % (train_samples, n_features, n_classes)\n)\n\nmodels = {\n    \"ovr\": {\"name\": \"One versus Rest\", \"iters\": [1, 2, 3]},\n    \"multinomial\": {\"name\": \"Multinomial\", \"iters\": [1, 2, 5]},\n}",

The newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers support only L2\n    regularization with primal formulation. The liblinear solver supports both\n    L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.\n    Elastic-Net penalty is only supported by the saga solver.\n\n    For the grid of `Cs` values and `l1_ratios` values, the best hyperparameter\n    is selected by the cross-validator\n    :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold`, but it can be changed\n    using the :term:`cv` parameter. The 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'\n    solvers can warm-start the coefficients (see :term:`Glossary<warm_start>`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    Cs : int or list of floats, default=10\n        Each of the values in Cs describes the inverse of regularization\n        strength. If Cs is as an int, then a grid of Cs values are chosen\n        in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4.\n        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger\n        regularization.\n\n    fit_intercept : bool, default=True\n        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be\n        added to the decision function.\n\n    cv : int or cross-validation generator, default=None\n        The default cross-validation generator used is Stratified K-Folds.\n        If an integer is provided, then it is the number of folds used.\n        See the module :mod:`sklearn.model_selection` module for the\n        list of possible cross-validation objects.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.\n\n    dual : bool, default=False\n        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for\n        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when\n        n_samples > n_features.\n\n    penalty : {'l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'}, default='l2'\n        Specify the norm of the penalty:\n\n        - `'l2'`: add a L2 penalty term (used by default);\n        - `'l1'`: add a L1 penalty term;\n        - `'elasticnet'`: both L1 and L2 penalty terms are added.\n\n        .. warning::\n           Some penalties may not work with some solvers. See the parameter\n           `solver` below, to know the compatibility between the penalty and\n           solver.\n\n    scoring : str or callable, default=None\n        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or\n        a scorer callable object / function with signature\n        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``. For a list of scoring functions\n        that can be used, look at :mod:`sklearn.metrics`. The\n        default scoring option used is 'accuracy'.\n\n    solver : {'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'newton-cholesky', 'sag', 'saga'}, \\\n            default='lbfgs'\n\n        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem. Default is 'lbfgs'.\n        To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:\n\n            - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'\n              and 'saga' are faster for large ones;\n            - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and\n              'lbfgs' handle multinomial loss;\n            - 'liblinear' might be slower in :class:`LogisticRegressionCV`\n              because it does not handle warm-starting. 'liblinear' is\n              limited to one-versus-rest schemes.\n            - 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for `n_samples` >> `n_features`,\n              especially with one-hot encoded categorical features with rare\n              categories. Note that it is limited to binary classification and the\n              one-versus-rest reduction for multiclass classification. Be aware that\n              the memory usage of this solver has a quadratic dependency on\n              `n_features` because it explicitly computes the Hessian matrix.\n\n        .. warning::\n           The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen.\n           Supported penalties by solver:\n\n           - 'lbfgs'           -   ['l2']\n           - 'liblinear'       -   ['l1', 'l2']\n           - 'newton-cg'       -   ['l2']\n           - 'newton-cholesky' -   ['l2']\n           - 'sag'             -   ['l2']\n           - 'saga'            -   ['elasticnet', 'l1', 'l2']\n\n        .. note::\n           'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features\n           with approximately the same scale.

In this case, x becomes\n        [x, self.intercept_scaling],\n        i.e. a \"synthetic\" feature with constant value equal to\n        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.\n        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.\n\n        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization\n        as all other features.\n        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight\n        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.\n\n    multi_class : {'auto, 'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default='auto'\n        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each\n        label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit\n        across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is\n        binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.\n        'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',\n        and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.18\n           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n            Default changed from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.\n\n    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None\n        Used when `solver='sag'`, 'saga' or 'liblinear' to shuffle the data.\n        Note that this only applies to the solver and not the cross-validation\n        generator. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.\n\n    l1_ratios : list of float, default=None\n        The list of Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``.\n        Only used if ``penalty='elasticnet'``. A value of 0 is equivalent to\n        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using\n        ``penalty='l1'``. For ``0 < l1_ratio <1``, the penalty is a combination\n        of L1 and L2.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, )\n        A list of class labels known to the classifier.\n\n    coef_ : ndarray of shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)\n        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.\n\n        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem\n        is binary.\n\n    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (1,) or (n_classes,)\n        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.\n\n        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.\n        `intercept_` is of shape(1,) when the problem is binary.\n\n    Cs_ : ndarray of shape (n_cs)\n        Array of C i.e. inverse of regularization parameter values used\n        for cross-validation.\n\n    l1_ratios_ : ndarray of shape (n_l1_ratios)\n        Array of l1_ratios used for cross-validation.

The newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers support only L2\n    regularization with primal formulation. The liblinear solver supports both\n    L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.\n    Elastic-Net penalty is only supported by the saga solver.\n\n    For the grid of `Cs` values and `l1_ratios` values, the best hyperparameter\n    is selected by the cross-validator\n    :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold`, but it can be changed\n    using the :term:`cv` parameter. The 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'\n    solvers can warm-start the coefficients (see :term:`Glossary<warm_start>`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    Cs : int or list of floats, default=10\n        Each of the values in Cs describes the inverse of regularization\n        strength. If Cs is as an int, then a grid of Cs values are chosen\n        in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4.\n        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger\n        regularization.\n\n    fit_intercept : bool, default=True\n        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be\n        added to the decision function.\n\n    cv : int or cross-validation generator, default=None\n        The default cross-validation generator used is Stratified K-Folds.\n        If an integer is provided, then it is the number of folds used.\n        See the module :mod:`sklearn.model_selection` module for the\n        list of possible cross-validation objects.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.\n\n    dual : bool, default=False\n        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for\n        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when\n        n_samples > n_features.\n\n    penalty : {'l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'}, default='l2'\n        Specify the norm of the penalty:\n\n        - `'l2'`: add a L2 penalty term (used by default);\n        - `'l1'`: add a L1 penalty term;\n        - `'elasticnet'`: both L1 and L2 penalty terms are added.\n\n        .. warning::\n           Some penalties may not work with some solvers. See the parameter\n           `solver` below, to know the compatibility between the penalty and\n           solver.\n\n    scoring : str or callable, default=None\n        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or\n        a scorer callable object / function with signature\n        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``. For a list of scoring functions\n        that can be used, look at :mod:`sklearn.metrics`. The\n        default scoring option used is 'accuracy'.\n\n    solver : {'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'newton-cholesky', 'sag', 'saga'}, \\\n            default='lbfgs'\n\n        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem. Default is 'lbfgs'.\n        To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:\n\n            - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'\n              and 'saga' are faster for large ones;\n            - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and\n              'lbfgs' handle multinomial loss;\n            - 'liblinear' might be slower in :class:`LogisticRegressionCV`\n              because it does not handle warm-starting. 'liblinear' is\n              limited to one-versus-rest schemes.\n            - 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for `n_samples` >> `n_features`,\n              especially with one-hot encoded categorical features with rare\n              categories. Note that it is limited to binary classification and the\n              one-versus-rest reduction for multiclass classification. Be aware that\n              the memory usage of this solver has a quadratic dependency on\n              `n_features` because it explicitly computes the Hessian matrix.\n\n        .. warning::\n           The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen.\n           Supported penalties by solver:\n\n           - 'lbfgs'           -   ['l2']\n           - 'liblinear'       -   ['l1', 'l2']\n           - 'newton-cg'       -   ['l2']\n           - 'newton-cholesky' -   ['l2']\n           - 'sag'             -   ['l2']\n           - 'saga'            -   ['elasticnet', 'l1', 'l2']\n\n        .. note::\n           'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features\n           with approximately the same scale.

In this case, x becomes\n        [x, self.intercept_scaling],\n        i.e. a \"synthetic\" feature with constant value equal to\n        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.\n        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.\n\n        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization\n        as all other features.\n        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight\n        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.\n\n    multi_class : {'auto, 'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default='auto'\n        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each\n        label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit\n        across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is\n        binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.\n        'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',\n        and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.18\n           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n            Default changed from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.\n\n    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None\n        Used when `solver='sag'`, 'saga' or 'liblinear' to shuffle the data.\n        Note that this only applies to the solver and not the cross-validation\n        generator. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.\n\n    l1_ratios : list of float, default=None\n        The list of Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``.\n        Only used if ``penalty='elasticnet'``. A value of 0 is equivalent to\n        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using\n        ``penalty='l1'``.
