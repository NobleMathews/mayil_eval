    "body": "while writing some other bits and pieces, I had a use case for checking the `warnings` omitted, `RunResult` has a `assert_outcomes()` that doesn't quite offer `warnings=` yet the information is already available in there, I suspect there is a good reason why we don't have `assert_outcomes(warnings=...)` so I propose some additional capabilities on `RunResult` to handle warnings in isolation.\r\n\r\nWith `assert_outcomes()` the full dict comparison may get a bit intrusive as far as warning capture is concerned.\r\n\r\nsomething simple like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nresult = pytester.runpytest(...)\r\nresult.assert_warnings(count=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature request for enhancing `RunResult` warning assertion capabilities, follow these steps:\n\n- Identify the `RunResult` class within the codebase. This class should be part of the testing framework, likely in a file related to test results or pytest plugin development.\n- Add a new method `assert_warnings` to the `RunResult` class. This method should accept a parameter `count` which specifies the expected number of warnings.\n- Inside the `assert_warnings` method, access the warnings captured during the test run. This information might be stored in an attribute of `RunResult` or accessible through a method.\n- Compare the actual number of warnings captured with the expected `count` provided to the `assert_warnings` method.\n- If the actual count does not match the expected count, raise an assertion error with a descriptive message.\n- Write tests for the new `assert_warnings` method to ensure it works as expected.\n\nHere is a pseudo-code example of what the `assert_warnings` method might look like:\n\n```python\nclass RunResult:\n    # ... existing methods ...\n\n    def assert_warnings(self, count=None):\n        actual_count = len(self.warnings)  # Assuming `self.warnings` holds the captured warnings\n        if count is not None and actual_count != count:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"Expected {count} warnings, but got {actual_count}\")\n```\n\nAnd a test for this method:\n\n```python\ndef test_assert_warnings():\n    result = RunResult()\n    # ... code to simulate warnings ...\n    result.assert_warnings(count=1)  # Replace with the actual expected count\n```\n\nRemember to import any necessary modules and handle any edge cases or additional functionality as required by the project's standards.",

            "reason": "Criteria: The RESPONSE must be relevant to the entire PROMPT to get a score of 9 or 10. The RESPONSE that is RELEVANT and answers the entire PROMPT completely should get a score of 10.\nSupporting Evidence: The RESPONSE directly addresses the user's request for enhancing the `RunResult` warning assertion capabilities by providing a detailed step-by-step guide on how to implement the feature. It includes identifying the `RunResult` class, adding a new method, accessing the warnings, comparing the actual number of warnings with the expected count, and raising an assertion error if they do not match. The RESPONSE also provides pseudo-code for the new method and a test case, which is exactly what the PROMPT is seeking. The RESPONSE is relevant to the entire PROMPT and answers it completely, thus it meets the criteria for a score of 10."
