    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information and code snippets, the issue seems to be related to the use of `.distinct()` on a queryset that has been combined using `.union()`. The `.distinct()` method is not affecting the queryset as expected, particularly when used with field names.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `.annotate()` method is not being used with `.distinct(fields)` as this combination is not implemented, as indicated by the `raise NotImplementedError` in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` snippet.\n- If `.distinct('name')` is used after `.union()`, make sure that the database backend supports this operation. Some databases may not support `DISTINCT ON` with a union of annotated querysets.\n- If the database backend does not support the desired operation, consider performing the distinct operation in Python after evaluating the queryset, or restructuring the query to avoid the need for `.distinct()` on a combined queryset.\n- If the database backend supports the operation but it's not working as expected, check if the `distinct_fields` are being properly handled in the `get_distinct` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`.\n- Ensure that the `order_by` clause is compatible with the `distinct` clause. The fields in `order_by` should match or be a subset of the fields in `distinct` when using `distinct` with field names.\n- If the issue persists, consider creating a custom SQL query using `.raw()` to perform the union and distinct operations as needed, ensuring that the resulting SQL matches the expected SQL query structure for the wrapped union with distinct.\n\nRemember to test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the issue is resolved and that no new issues are introduced.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1673 - 2061](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1673-L2061)\n\n This snippet contains the distinct() method of the QuerySet class, which is directly related to the issue as the distinct() call is not working as expected after a union operation.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 556 - 1141](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L556-L1141)\n\n This snippet is part of the SQL compiler and deals with how combined queries are handled, which is relevant since the issue involves a union operation that should be followed by a distinct call. \n\n\n   - [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet raises an error for the combination of annotate() and distinct(fields), which is relevant to the issue as the user is trying to use annotate() with distinct() after a union operation. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1000 - 1141](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L1000-L1141)\n\n This snippet contains the get_distinct() method which is responsible for handling the DISTINCT ON SQL clause, which is relevant to the issue as the expected behavior involves DISTINCT ON.",

The fields in `order_by` should match or be a subset of the fields in `distinct` when using `distinct` with field names.\n- If the issue persists, consider creating a custom SQL query using `.raw()` to perform the union and distinct operations as needed, ensuring that the resulting SQL matches the expected SQL query structure for the wrapped union with distinct.\n\nRemember to test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the issue is resolved and that no new issues are introduced.",
