But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The `uniq` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` is designed to yield unique elements from a sequence.\n- The error occurs because the sequence `f` is being modified during iteration by the `uniq` function.\n- To fix the issue, avoid modifying the sequence `f` while it is being iterated over by `uniq`.\n\nSolution:\n- Modify the code snippet that demonstrates the issue to create a copy of the list before iteration:\n  ```python\n  f = list('THISTLE')\n  for i in uniq(f[:]):  # Use a slice to create a copy of the list\n      f.remove(i)\n  ```\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [utilities](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/utilities)- [Lines 2100 - 2153](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L2100-L2153)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of the 'uniq' function, which is directly related to the issue. It needs to be modified to check the size of the sequence during iteration and raise a RuntimeError if the size changes.",
