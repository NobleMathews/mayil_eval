    "mayil_response": "To resolve the `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison` when calling `sum_of_squares(n, k)` with large values of `n` and `k=2`, you can modify the `pow_rep_recursive` function to use an iterative approach instead of recursion. Here's a possible solution:\n\n- Replace the recursive `pow_rep_recursive` function with an iterative version.\n- Use a stack to simulate the recursive calls.\n\nHere's a sketch of how the iterative version of `pow_rep_recursive` might look:\n\n```python\ndef pow_rep_recursive(n_i, k, n_remaining, terms, p):\n    stack = [(n_i, k, n_remaining, terms)]\n    while stack:\n        n_i, k, n_remaining, terms = stack.pop()\n        if k == 0 and n_remaining == 0:\n            yield tuple(terms)\n        else:\n            if n_i >= 1 and k > 0:\n                stack.append((n_i - 1, k, n_remaining, terms))\n                residual = n_remaining - pow(n_i, p)\n                if residual >= 0:\n                    stack.append((n_i, k - 1, residual, terms + [n_i]))\n```\n\nThis change should prevent the `RecursionError` by using an explicit stack to manage the function calls instead of relying on the Python call stack.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.12/tree//sympy) \u2192 [solvers](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.12/tree//sympy/solvers) \u2192 [diophantine](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.12/tree//sympy/solvers/diophantine)- [Lines 3577 - 3639](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.12/blob//sympy/solvers/diophantine/diophantine.py#L3577-L3639)\n\n This snippet contains the recursive function 'pow_rep_recursive' which is directly involved in the recursion overflow issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1715 - 3563](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.12/blob//sympy/solvers/diophantine/diophantine.py#L1715-L3563)\n\n This snippet contains the 'power_representation' function which calls 'pow_rep_recursive' and is relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 3642 - 3677](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.12/blob//sympy/solvers/diophantine/diophantine.py#L3642-L3677)\n\n This snippet contains the '_can_do_sum_of_squares' function which determines if a number can be represented as a sum of squares and may be relevant to the issue.",
