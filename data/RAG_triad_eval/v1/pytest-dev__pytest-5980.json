    "body": "After discussion in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/4447#issuecomment-441132410, @RonnyPfannschmidt mentions he would like to provide a replacement to `--result-log` in the core before removing it (#3081).\r\n\r\nThis potentially is an easy contribution given that we have the `resultlog.py` plugin already which can be used as a starting point.\r\n\r\nI would like for us to discuss how that \"log file\" will look like in this issue. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI understand the rationale is to provide a line-based log file, which can be parsed using standard tools.\r\n\r\nI have used a log file in the past where each line was a JSON object, something like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"progress\": 0.25, \"status\": \"Running simulation\"}\r\n{\"progress\": 0.30, \"status\": \"Running simulation\"}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\npytest would then write each line to the file during `pytest_runtest_logreport`, like `resultlog.py` does now.\r\n\r\nI suppose we also want to add an option to replay the tests in a log file, so users can reproduce a previous run that was saved to a log?\r\n\r\n@RonnyPfannschmidt you also mentioned that `pytest-tap` would not be an appropriate replacement, can you elaborate on why?\r\n\r\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude10.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nBased on the provided issue summary and code snippets, the following solution can be proposed:\n\n- Remove the `--result-log` option from the `pytest_addoption` function in the `resultlog.py` plugin or any other relevant plugin file where it might be defined.\n- Implement a new logging mechanism within the `pytest_runtest_logreport` hook function, ensuring that each log entry is written in the new line-based format, potentially as JSON objects.\n- Add a new command-line option, such as `--new-log-option`, to enable the new logging feature, using the `pytest_addoption` function.\n- Create a new function, possibly named `pytest_replay_logfile`, that reads the new log file format and replays the tests as specified in the issue summary.\n- Ensure that the new log file format is easily parseable with standard tools and compatible with existing systems that may consume pytest logs.\n- Since `pytest-tap` is not a suitable replacement, ensure that the new logging feature provides the necessary functionality that `pytest-tap` lacks, as per the discussion in the issue summary.\n\nThe code snippets provided do not directly relate to the implementation of the new logging mechanism or the replay feature, so they can be ignored for the purpose of this solution.",

It also acknowledges the need to provide functionality that `pytest-tap` lacks, which is a specific point mentioned in the PROMPT.
