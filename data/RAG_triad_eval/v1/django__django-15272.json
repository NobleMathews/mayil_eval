    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Raphael Gaschignard)\n\t \nBecause the migration optimizer still has a bit of trouble with reducing operations, you often want to edit squashed migrations and re-run it through the optimizer.\nThe attached patch contains an implementation of a management command, optimizemigration, that will help speed up this process.\noptimizemigration app_name migration_name reads a single migration, pass it through the optimizer, and then rewrite the result to disk. Unlike squashmigrations, this ignores things like the squashed-ness of the migration.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the `optimizemigration` management command, follow these steps:\n\n- Ensure the `MigrationOptimizer` class is imported from `django.db.migrations.optimizer`.\n- Create a new management command class `optimizemigration` in `django/core/management/commands/optimizemigration.py`.\n- Inherit from `BaseCommand` or another appropriate base class provided by Django for management commands.\n- Define the `add_arguments` method to add the `app_label` and `migration_name` arguments, and an optional `--check` flag.\n- Implement the `handle` method to perform the following actions:\n  - Retrieve the `app_label`, `migration_name`, and `check` flag from the command options.\n  - Load the migration using `MigrationLoader` and retrieve the specific migration by `app_label` and `migration_name`.\n  - Instantiate the `MigrationOptimizer` and call its `optimize` method with the migration's operations.\n  - Compare the length of the original and optimized operations. If they are the same and `verbosity` is greater than 0, print \"No optimizations possible.\"\n  - If the `check` flag is set and optimizations were made, exit with a non-zero status.\n  - Otherwise, replace the migration's operations with the optimized operations.\n  - Use `MigrationWriter` to write the optimized migration back to disk.\n  - If `verbosity` is greater than 0, print the path to the optimized migration.\n\nHere is a simplified version of the `handle` method:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError\nfrom django.db.migrations.loader import MigrationLoader\nfrom django.db.migrations.writer import MigrationWriter\nfrom django.db.migrations.optimizer import MigrationOptimizer\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    help = \"Optimizes the operations for the named migration.\"\n\n    def add_arguments(self, parser):\n        parser.add_argument(\"app_label\", help=\"App label of the application to optimize the migration for.\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"migration_name\", help=\"Migration name to optimize the operations for.\")\n        parser.add_argument(\"--check\", action=\"store_true\", help=\"Exit with a non-zero status if the migration can be optimized.\")\n\n    def handle(self, *args, **options):\n        app_label = options[\"app_label\"]\n        migration_name = options[\"migration_name\"]\n        check = options[\"check\"]\n        verbosity = options[\"verbosity\"]\n\n        loader = MigrationLoader(None)\n        migration = loader.get_migration_by_prefix(app_label, migration_name)\n        optimizer = MigrationOptimizer()\n        new_operations = optimizer.optimize(migration.operations, migration.app_label)\n\n        if len(migration.operations) == len(new_operations) and verbosity > 0:\n            self.stdout.write(\"No optimizations possible.\")\n            return\n\n        if check and len(migration.operations) != len(new_operations):\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n        migration.operations = new_operations\n        writer = MigrationWriter(migration)\n        with open(writer.path, \"w\", encoding=\"utf-8\") as fh:\n            fh.write(writer.as_string())\n\n        if verbosity > 0:\n            self.stdout.write(f\"Optimized migration {writer.path}\")\n```\n\nRemember to handle exceptions and edge cases as shown in the provided code snippets. This implementation assumes that the `MigrationLoader`, `MigrationWriter`, and `MigrationOptimizer` classes work as expected and that the necessary imports are in place.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 33 - 105](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/optimizemigration.py#L33-L105)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation of the 'optimizemigration' management command which is directly related to the issue of optimizing a migration. \n\n\n   - [Lines 84 - 129](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/optimizemigration.py#L84-L129)\n\n This snippet is part of the 'optimizemigration' command implementation and deals with the case where manual porting is required after optimization, which is relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 16 - 129](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/optimizemigration.py#L16-L129)\n\n This snippet shows the argument parsing for the 'optimizemigration' command, which is relevant for understanding how the command is intended to be used and could be relevant if changes to the command's interface are required.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 1 - 1](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/optimizer.py#L1-L1)\n\n This snippet defines the 'MigrationOptimizer' class, which is likely used by the 'optimizemigration' command to perform the optimization of migrations.",
