    "mayil_response": "To resolve the `TypeError: n_neighbors does not take <class 'numpy.float64'> value, enter integer value`, you should ensure that `min_samples` is an integer before it is used as the `n_neighbors` parameter in the `NearestNeighbors` class. The issue occurs in the `compute_optics_graph` function of the `OPTICS` class.\n\n- Modify the `compute_optics_graph` function in the `sklearn/cluster/_optics.py` file to convert `min_samples` to an integer after it is potentially assigned a float value.\n- Replace the following lines:\n  ```python\n  if min_samples <= 1:\n      min_samples = max(2, int(min_samples * n_samples))\n  ```\n  with:\n  ```python\n  if min_samples <= 1:\n      min_samples = int(round(max(2, min_samples * n_samples)))\n  ```\n- This change ensures that `min_samples` is rounded and converted to an integer before being used as the `n_neighbors` parameter.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [cluster](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/cluster)- [Lines 423 - 635](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L423-L635)\n\n This snippet contains the instantiation of the NearestNeighbors class with min_samples, which is the direct cause of the issue when min_samples is a float. \n\n\n   - [Lines 36 - 1101](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L36-L1101)\n\n This snippet includes the OPTICS class definition and the min_samples parameter description, which is relevant for understanding the expected type and behavior of min_samples. \n\n\n   - [Lines 391 - 433](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/cluster/_optics.py#L391-L433)\n\n This snippet contains the _validate_size function which is used to validate the min_samples parameter and could be relevant when considering changes to parameter validation.",

Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable\n    neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large datasets than the\n    current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.\n\n    Clusters are then extracted using a DBSCAN-like method\n    (cluster_method = 'dbscan') or an automatic\n    technique proposed in [1]_ (cluster_method = 'xi').\n\n    This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing\n    k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then\n    computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the\n    cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion\n    candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <optics>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    min_samples : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=5\n        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as\n        a core point. Also, up and down steep regions can't have more than\n        ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep points. Expressed as an absolute\n        number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least\n        2).\n\n    max_eps : float, default=np.inf\n        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n        in the neighborhood of the other. Default value of ``np.inf`` will\n        identify clusters across all scales; reducing ``max_eps`` will result\n        in shorter run times.\n\n    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'\n        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn\n        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.\n\n        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each\n        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable\n        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the\n        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less\n        efficient than passing the metric name as a string. If metric is\n        \"precomputed\", `X` is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be\n        square.\n\n        Valid values for metric are:\n\n        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',\n          'manhattan']\n\n        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',\n          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',\n          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',\n          'yule']\n\n        Sparse matrices are only supported by scikit-learn metrics.\n        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n        metrics.\n\n        .. note::\n           `'kulsinski'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will removed in SciPy 1.11.\n\n    p : float, default=2\n        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from\n        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is\n        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance\n        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.\n\n    metric_params : dict, default=None\n        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.\n\n    cluster_method : str, default='xi'\n        The extraction method used to extract clusters using the calculated\n        reachability and ordering. Possible values are \"xi\" and \"dbscan\".\n\n    eps : float, default=None\n        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n        in the neighborhood of the other. By default it assumes the same value\n        as ``max_eps``.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='dbscan'``.\n\n    xi : float between 0 and 1, default=0.05\n        Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that\n        constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the\n        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its\n        successor being at most 1-xi.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    predecessor_correction : bool, default=True\n        Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS\n        [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None\n        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an\n        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be\n        at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'\n        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:\n\n        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.\n        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`.\n        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.\n        - 'auto' (default) will attempt to decide the most appropriate\n          algorithm based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.\n\n        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of\n        this parameter, using brute force.\n\n    leaf_size : int, default=30\n        Leaf size passed to :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` or\n        :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`. This can affect the speed of the\n        construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the\n        tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.\n\n    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None\n        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.\n        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the\n        path to the caching directory.\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.\n        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.\n        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().\n        Noisy samples and points which are not included in a leaf cluster\n        of ``cluster_hierarchy_`` are labeled as -1.\n\n    reachability_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use\n        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    ordering_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.\n\n    core_distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object\n        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use\n        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    predecessor_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.\n        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.\n\n    cluster_hierarchy_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)\n        The list of clusters in the form of ``[start, end]`` in each row, with\n        all indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to\n        ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing\n        smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does\n        not reflect the hierarchy, usually\n        ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also\n        note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.\n        ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.\n        Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    n_features_in_ : int\n        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\n    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`\n        has feature names that are all strings.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 1.0\n\n    See Also\n    --------\n    DBSCAN : A similar clustering for a specified neighborhood radius (eps).\n        Our implementation is optimized for runtime.\n\n    References\n    ----------\n    ..

Unlike DBSCAN, keeps cluster hierarchy for a variable\n    neighborhood radius. Better suited for usage on large datasets than the\n    current sklearn implementation of DBSCAN.\n\n    Clusters are then extracted using a DBSCAN-like method\n    (cluster_method = 'dbscan') or an automatic\n    technique proposed in [1]_ (cluster_method = 'xi').\n\n    This implementation deviates from the original OPTICS by first performing\n    k-nearest-neighborhood searches on all points to identify core sizes, then\n    computing only the distances to unprocessed points when constructing the\n    cluster order. Note that we do not employ a heap to manage the expansion\n    candidates, so the time complexity will be O(n^2).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <optics>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    min_samples : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=5\n        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered as\n        a core point. Also, up and down steep regions can't have more than\n        ``min_samples`` consecutive non-steep points. Expressed as an absolute\n        number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be at least\n        2).\n\n    max_eps : float, default=np.inf\n        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n        in the neighborhood of the other. Default value of ``np.inf`` will\n        identify clusters across all scales; reducing ``max_eps`` will result\n        in shorter run times.\n\n    metric : str or callable, default='minkowski'\n        Metric to use for distance computation. Any metric from scikit-learn\n        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.\n\n        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each\n        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable\n        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the\n        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less\n        efficient than passing the metric name as a string. If metric is\n        \"precomputed\", `X` is assumed to be a distance matrix and must be\n        square.\n\n        Valid values for metric are:\n\n        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',\n          'manhattan']\n\n        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',\n          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',\n          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',\n          'yule']\n\n        Sparse matrices are only supported by scikit-learn metrics.\n        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n        metrics.\n\n        .. note::\n           `'kulsinski'` is deprecated from SciPy 1.9 and will removed in SciPy 1.11.\n\n    p : float, default=2\n        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from\n        :class:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances`. When p = 1, this is\n        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance\n        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.\n\n    metric_params : dict, default=None\n        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.\n\n    cluster_method : str, default='xi'\n        The extraction method used to extract clusters using the calculated\n        reachability and ordering. Possible values are \"xi\" and \"dbscan\".\n\n    eps : float, default=None\n        The maximum distance between two samples for one to be considered as\n        in the neighborhood of the other. By default it assumes the same value\n        as ``max_eps``.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='dbscan'``.\n\n    xi : float between 0 and 1, default=0.05\n        Determines the minimum steepness on the reachability plot that\n        constitutes a cluster boundary. For example, an upwards point in the\n        reachability plot is defined by the ratio from one point to its\n        successor being at most 1-xi.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    predecessor_correction : bool, default=True\n        Correct clusters according to the predecessors calculated by OPTICS\n        [2]_. This parameter has minimal effect on most datasets.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    min_cluster_size : int > 1 or float between 0 and 1, default=None\n        Minimum number of samples in an OPTICS cluster, expressed as an\n        absolute number or a fraction of the number of samples (rounded to be\n        at least 2). If ``None``, the value of ``min_samples`` is used instead.\n        Used only when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, default='auto'\n        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:\n\n        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree`.\n        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`.\n        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.\n        - 'auto' (default) will attempt to decide the most appropriate\n          algorithm based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.\n\n        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of\n        this parameter, using brute force.\n\n    leaf_size : int, default=30\n        Leaf size passed to :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` or\n        :class:`~sklearn.neighbors.KDTree`. This can affect the speed of the\n        construction and query, as well as the memory required to store the\n        tree. The optimal value depends on the nature of the problem.\n\n    memory : str or object with the joblib.Memory interface, default=None\n        Used to cache the output of the computation of the tree.\n        By default, no caching is done. If a string is given, it is the\n        path to the caching directory.\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search.\n        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.\n        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    labels_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Cluster labels for each point in the dataset given to fit().\n        Noisy samples and points which are not included in a leaf cluster\n        of ``cluster_hierarchy_`` are labeled as -1.\n\n    reachability_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Reachability distances per sample, indexed by object order. Use\n        ``clust.reachability_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    ordering_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        The cluster ordered list of sample indices.\n\n    core_distances_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Distance at which each sample becomes a core point, indexed by object\n        order. Points which will never be core have a distance of inf. Use\n        ``clust.core_distances_[clust.ordering_]`` to access in cluster order.\n\n    predecessor_ : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)\n        Point that a sample was reached from, indexed by object order.\n        Seed points have a predecessor of -1.\n\n    cluster_hierarchy_ : ndarray of shape (n_clusters, 2)\n        The list of clusters in the form of ``[start, end]`` in each row, with\n        all indices inclusive. The clusters are ordered according to\n        ``(end, -start)`` (ascending) so that larger clusters encompassing\n        smaller clusters come after those smaller ones. Since ``labels_`` does\n        not reflect the hierarchy, usually\n        ``len(cluster_hierarchy_) > np.unique(optics.labels_)``. Please also\n        note that these indices are of the ``ordering_``, i.e.\n        ``X[ordering_][start:end + 1]`` form a cluster.\n        Only available when ``cluster_method='xi'``.\n\n    n_features_in_ : int\n        Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.24\n\n    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n        Names of features seen during :term:`fit`.
