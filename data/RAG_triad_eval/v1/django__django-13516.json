    "body": "Description\n\t\nflush() is notably called during migrate command; it doesn't work, and a long migration effectively prints to stderr no relevant information up until the end:\nOperations to perform:\n Apply all migrations: myapp\nRunning migrations:\nThen nothing more, but the migration is being done.\nThen at the end of the real migration, the rest is flushed:\n Applying myapp.0002_auto_20200817_1030... OK\nExpected behavior:\nOperations to perform:\n Apply all migrations: myapp\nRunning migrations:\n Applying myapp.0002_auto_20200817_1030...\nthen work\nthen OK\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be that the `flush()` method is not working as expected during migrations, causing migration steps and statuses to be printed all at once at the end of the migration process instead of in real-time.\n\nTo address this issue, ensure that the `flush()` method is called after each output statement that needs to be immediately visible to the user. This can be done by reviewing the `migrate.py` file where the migration operations are being printed to the console.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n- In the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file, locate the `migration_progress_callback` method.\n- Ensure that `self.stdout.flush()` is called after each write operation to `self.stdout` that you want to be displayed in real-time.\n\nFor example, the existing code in `migrate.py`:\n\n```python\ndef migration_progress_callback(self, action, migration=None, fake=False):\n    if self.verbosity >= 1:\n        compute_time = self.verbosity > 1\n        if action == \"apply_start\":\n            if compute_time:\n                self.start = time.monotonic()\n            self.stdout.write(\"  Applying %s...\" % migration, ending=\"\")\n            self.stdout.flush()\n        # ... other actions ...\n```\n\nThis code already calls `self.stdout.flush()` after writing the \"Applying\" message, which should ensure real-time output. If the issue persists, check for other places in the code where output is written to `self.stdout` or `self.stderr` and ensure that `flush()` is called appropriately after each write operation.\n\nIf the issue is not with the migration progress output but with other parts of the migration command, you would need to apply a similar fix to those parts of the code, ensuring that `flush()` is called after each output statement.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 392 - 430](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/core/management/commands/migrate.py#L392-L430)\n\n This snippet contains the code for the 'migrate' command where 'flush' is called on 'stdout'. The issue describes a problem with 'flush' not working during migrations, which makes this snippet directly relevant to the issue.",

This can be done by reviewing the `migrate.py` file where the migration operations are being printed to the console.\n\nHere is the solution:\n\n- In the `django/core/management/commands/migrate.py` file, locate the `migration_progress_callback` method.\n- Ensure that `self.stdout.flush()` is called after each write operation to `self.stdout` that you want to be displayed in real-time.\n\nFor example, the existing code in `migrate.py`:\n\n```python\ndef migration_progress_callback(self, action, migration=None, fake=False):\n    if self.verbosity >= 1:\n        compute_time = self.verbosity > 1\n        if action == \"apply_start\":\n            if compute_time:\n                self.start = time.monotonic()\n            self.stdout.write(\"  Applying %s...\" % migration, ending=\"\")\n            self.stdout.flush()\n        # ... other actions ...\n```\n\nThis code already calls `self.stdout.flush()` after writing the \"Applying\" message, which should ensure real-time output. If the issue persists, check for other places in the code where output is written to `self.stdout` or `self.stderr` and ensure that `flush()` is called appropriately after each write operation.\n\nIf the issue is not with the migration progress output but with other parts of the migration command, you would need to apply a similar fix to those parts of the code, ensuring that `flush()` is called after each output statement.",
