    "mayil_response": "- Remove the logic that sets `order_by` to `None` when `_meta_ordering` is present in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, as this is likely causing the incorrect aggregation due to the `Meta.ordering` fields being included in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n- Ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause is constructed based on the fields that are actually being grouped in the query, and not influenced by the default `Meta.ordering` of the model.\n- Review and possibly integrate the test case from the PR to ensure that the issue is resolved and that the new behavior is correctly tested.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet contains logic for appending 'GROUP BY' clause to the SQL query, which is directly related to the issue of 'Meta.ordering' fields being included in 'GROUP BY' when they should not be. \n\n\n   - [Lines 155 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L155-L1596)\n\n This snippet includes conditions for when expressions are added to the 'GROUP BY' clause, which is relevant to the issue as it may contain the logic that incorrectly includes 'Meta.ordering' fields. \n\n\n   - [Lines 79 - 154](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L79-L154)\n\n This snippet provides an explanation of the logic behind the 'GROUP BY' clause and how different methods like annotate(), values(), and order_by() affect it, which is relevant to understanding the issue at hand.",
