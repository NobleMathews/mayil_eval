This might involve explicitly specifying the fields in the `group_by` attribute of the `QuerySet`.\n- If the subquery annotation is not being included in the `GROUP BY` clause after the Django upgrade, consider using `.values()` before `.annotate()` to force the inclusion of the necessary fields in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n- Check if the `distinct()` call is being applied correctly in the context of the `GROUP BY` clause. If necessary, adjust the `distinct()` fields to ensure the correct distinct results are returned.\n- Verify that the `Min` aggregate function is being used correctly and that it is included in the `GROUP BY` clause if needed.\n- If the `ST_Contains` function in the `WHERE` clause is causing issues with the `GROUP BY` section, ensure that the spatial lookups are correctly configured and that any necessary joins are properly constructed.\n- Review the use of `Subquery` and `OuterRef` to ensure that the subquery is correctly correlated with the outer query and that the fields referenced in the subquery are included in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n- If the `STATEMENT_TIMESTAMP()` function is used in the query and affects the `GROUP BY` behavior, ensure that it is used in a deterministic way that does not prevent the correct grouping of results.\n- If the issue persists, consider constructing the SQL query manually using Django's `RawQuerySet` as a last resort to achieve the desired results while the underlying issue with the ORM is being resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for appending the GROUP BY clause to the query, which is directly related to the issue of subquery annotations being omitted in the GROUP BY section. \n\n\n   - [Lines 155 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L155-L1596)\n\n This snippet includes logic for determining what goes into the GROUP BY clause, which is relevant to the issue at hand regarding the GROUP BY section of the query.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 467 - 508](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L467-L508)\n\n This snippet deals with the handling of inner and outer queries, annotations, and group by logic, which is relevant to the issue of how annotations are being handled in grouped queries. \n\n\n   - [Lines 509 - 2560](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L509-L2560)\n\n This snippet shows how annotations are being replaced in the query, which could be relevant to the issue if the problem lies in how annotations are being handled when multiple are declared. \n\n\n   - [Lines 72 - 553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L72-L553)\n\n This snippet shows the handling of annotations in the query, which is relevant to the issue since it involves subquery annotations in a GROUP BY query.",

            "reason": "Criteria: The RESPONSE is relevant to the entire PROMPT and answers the PROMPT completely.\nSupporting Evidence: The RESPONSE provides a detailed list of potential solutions and checks that are directly related to the issue described in the PROMPT, which is the omission of subquery annotations in the GROUP BY section of a query after upgrading to Django 3.0.2. It addresses the problem by suggesting explicit inclusion of fields in the GROUP BY clause, the correct use of `.values()` and `.annotate()`, the application of `distinct()`, the use of aggregate functions like `Min`, the configuration of spatial lookups like `ST_Contains`, the correct use of `Subquery` and `OuterRef`, and the deterministic use of `STATEMENT_TIMESTAMP()`. Additionally, it provides a last-resort solution of using `RawQuerySet` and references specific code snippets in the Django repository that are relevant to the GROUP BY clause logic. The RESPONSE is comprehensive and directly addresses the entire issue described in the PROMPT, thus earning the highest score."
