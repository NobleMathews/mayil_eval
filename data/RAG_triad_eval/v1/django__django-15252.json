    "title": "MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nHi,\nWe have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \nclass Router(object):\n\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\n\t\tif db == 'default':\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\treturn False\nCurrent Behaviour\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Modify the `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema` method to check if migrations are allowed for the given database using the router's `allow_migrate` method before attempting to create the migration table.\n- The `ensure_schema` method should use the `router.allow_migrate` method to determine if the migration table should be created for the database connection it is using.\n\n```python\n# django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n\nclass MigrationRecorder:\n    # ... [other methods and properties] ...\n\n    def ensure_schema(self):\n        \"\"\"Ensure the table exists and has the correct schema.\"\"\"\n        if self.has_table():\n            return\n\n        # Check if migrations are allowed on this database\n        if not router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, app_label='migrations'):\n            return\n\n        # Make the table\n        try:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:\n                editor.create_model(self.Migration)\n        except DatabaseError as exc:\n            raise MigrationSchemaMissing(\n                \"Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)\" % exc\n            )\n```\n\n- Ensure that the `router` module is imported at the beginning of the `recorder.py` file.\n\n```python\n# django/db/migrations/recorder.py\n\nfrom django.db import router\n# ... rest of the imports ...\n```\n\n- This solution assumes that the `app_label` for the migrations app is `'migrations'`. If it is different, replace `'migrations'` with the correct `app_label`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 10 - 82](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/recorder.py#L10-L82)\n\n This snippet contains the MigrationRecorder class and the ensure_schema method, which is directly related to the issue of the MigrationRecorder not obeying the db_router allow_migrate rules. \n\n\n   - [Lines 9 - 9](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/recorder.py#L9-L9)\n\n This snippet shows the definition of the MigrationRecorder class, which is central to the issue as it is responsible for recording migrations.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db)- [Lines 197 - 278](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/utils.py#L197-L278)\n\n This snippet defines the ConnectionRouter class and its allow_migrate method, which is relevant to the issue as it is part of the mechanism that should prevent migrations on databases other than 'default'.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 1 - 1](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/base.py#L1-L1)\n\n This snippet imports the router, which is relevant to the issue as the router's allow_migrate method should be consulted before migrations are recorded.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 1 - 7](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/executor.py#L1-L7)\n\n This snippet imports the MigrationRecorder in the migrations executor module, which is relevant because the executor is responsible for applying migrations and should respect the db_router rules.",
