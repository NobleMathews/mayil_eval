    "body": "Description\n\t\nWhen using Django Formset, the error messaging isn't checking for the condition where both min_num and max_num are equal and both validate_min and validate_max are set to true. \nCode highlighting:\nclass TestForm(forms.Form):\n\tmsg = forms.CharField()\ntest_formset = formset_factory(\n TestForm, \n min_num=2, \n max_num=2, \n validate_min=True, \n validate_max=True)\nWhen formset is created in the following way and both validate flags are set True the following error messages show up\nIf the supplied forms are less than two - please submit 2 or more forms expected please submit 2 forms similarly the reverse is also true when the forms are more than two it gives the error message saying please submit 2 or fewer forms expected please submit 2 forms\nThis was a \u200b bug reported on Wagtail and after investigating a little I noticed the incorrect messaging was coming from \u200b this part in the validation\n",

    "mayil_response": "To address the error messaging issue in the Django Formset when `min_num` and `max_num` are equal and both `validate_min` and `validate_max` are set to true, you should:\n\n- Locate the validation logic in the formset code where `min_num` and `max_num` are compared to the number of submitted forms.\n- Update the error messages to reflect the condition where `min_num` equals `max_num`, ensuring that the message is appropriate for the scenario where an exact number of forms is required.\n- Since the provided code snippets do not contain the specific validation logic for formsets, you will need to modify the `BaseFormSet` class in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file (which is not included in the provided snippets) to implement the correct messaging.\n\nHere is a hypothetical solution, assuming you are modifying the `BaseFormSet` class:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass BaseFormSet:\n    # ... (other methods and properties)\n\n    def clean(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks that the set of forms pass validation as a whole.\n        \"\"\"\n        super().clean()  # Call the parent class's clean method\n\n        # Check the number of forms against min_num and max_num\n        if self.validate_min and self.total_form_count() < self.min_num:\n            raise ValidationError(\n                _(\"Please submit exactly %(num_forms)d form(s).\") % {'num_forms': self.min_num}\n            )\n        if self.validate_max and self.total_form_count() > self.max_num:\n            raise ValidationError(\n                _(\"Please submit exactly %(num_forms)d form(s).\") % {'num_forms': self.max_num}\n            )\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the existing validation logic with the updated logic that checks for the exact number of forms required when `min_num` equals `max_num`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [forms](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/forms)- [Lines 1 - 49](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/forms/formsets.py#L1-L49)\n\n This snippet defines the ManagementForm class within the formsets module, which is directly related to the issue of formset validation and error messaging. The ManagementForm class handles the total number of forms and the initial number of forms, which are relevant to the min_num and max_num settings. Changes to the validation logic or error messaging may need to be made here.",
