But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The provided code snippets do not contain any references to `SpecModule` or its construction.\n- The issue description suggests that the problem lies within the `pytest-relaxed` plugin, which is not included in the provided snippets.\n- To resolve the issue, locate the code in the `pytest-relaxed` plugin where `SpecModule` is directly instantiated and replace it with the `from_parent` method.\n- The solution should look like this:\n\n```python\n# Before\nspec_module = SpecModule(...)\n\n# After\nspec_module = SpecModule.from_parent(parent=..., ...)\n```\n\n- Ensure that all arguments required for the `from_parent` method are passed correctly.\n- Replace all instances of direct `SpecModule` construction with the `from_parent` method to adhere to the updated `pytest` API and avoid deprecation warnings.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [scripts](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//scripts)- [Lines 1 - 155](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//scripts/update-plugin-list.py#L1-L155)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it deals with the generation of a plugin list for PyPI projects and does not contain code related to node construction or warning messages. \n\n\n   - [Lines 99 - 171](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//scripts/update-plugin-list.py#L99-L171)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is part of the same script as Snippet #1 and also deals with the generation of a plugin list, not with node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//.github)- [Lines 1 - 2](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//.github/config.yml#L1-L2)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a configuration file for Read the Docs and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//.github) \u2192 [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)- [Lines 1 - 5](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml#L1-L5)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a configuration file for GitHub issue templates and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [src](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//src)- [Lines 1 - 10](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//src/py.py#L1-L10)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a shim for pylib and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//.github)- [Lines 1 - 5](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//.github/FUNDING.yml#L1-L5)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a funding configuration file and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 13](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//bench/bench.py#L1-L13)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a benchmarking script and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 14](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//bench/manyparam.py#L1-L14)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a test file with parameterized fixtures and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n- - [Lines 73 - 108](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//.pre-commit-config.yaml#L73-L108)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a pre-commit configuration file and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.\n-  \u2192 [scripts](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//scripts)- [Lines 1 - 46](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//scripts/prepare-release-pr.py#L1-L46)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue because it is a script for preparing release PRs and does not pertain to node construction or warning messages.",
