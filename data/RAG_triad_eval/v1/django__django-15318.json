    "title": "Unify reverse foreign key and m2m unsaved model querying",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nCurrently when querying unsaved reverse relations the behavior differs.\nUsing model:\nclass Foo(models.Model):\n\tfk = models.ForeignKey('self', related_name='fk_rev')\n\tm2m = models.ManyToManyField('self')\nand test case:\nprint(Foo().fk_rev.all())\nprint(Foo().m2m.all())\nWe get [] from the first filter, but an error\nValueError: \"<Foo: Foo object>\" needs to have a value for field \"from_foo\" before this many-to-many relationship can be used.\nfrom the second filter.\nSo, m2m fields can't be filtered if the object isn't saved, but reverse fk fields can be filtered.\nThere is a (slightly stale) patch for #17541 which makes fk fields and m2m fields work consistently. The changes in behavior are:\n* Nullable many-to-many and foreign key relations will return an empty\n queryset when the relation field is null. For many-to-many this was\n previously an error (no change for foreign keys).\n* Trying to add objects to a foreign key relation when the relation field\n is null is now an error (no change for m2m).\n* Trying to use a relation of any kind when the object isn't saved is now\n an error (no change for m2m).\nI think we can squeeze these changes in as bug-fixes. These are slight backwards compatibility changes, but to me it seems that almost always the changes will be visible only in code that isn't working as intended. If these are seen as something likely breaking working code, then I don't see any way to make the APIs consistent.\nThe #17541 patch is available from: \u200bhttps://github.com/akaariai/django/compare/ticket_17541\n",

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude10.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nBased on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to querying unsaved instances of a model with self-referencing `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField`. The error message indicates that an attempt to access a many-to-many relationship on an unsaved model instance is causing a `ValueError`.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n\n- Ensure that instances of the `Foo` model are saved before accessing their many-to-many relationships.\n- Modify the `Foo` model's `save` method to handle saving related objects or to provide a clear error message when related objects are unsaved.\n- Review the `#17541 patch` to understand the intended changes and apply them to the `Foo` model if they are relevant to the issue.\n\nHere is a potential solution:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(models.Model):\n    fk = models.ForeignKey('self', related_name='fk_rev', on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n    m2m = models.ManyToManyField('self', blank=True)\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Save the instance if it doesn't have a primary key\n        if self._state.adding and self.pk is None:\n            super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Now it's safe to access many-to-many relationships\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n- Before accessing `Foo().fk_rev.all()` or `Foo().m2m.all()`, ensure that the `Foo` instance has been saved:\n\n```python\nfoo_instance = Foo()\nfoo_instance.save()  # Save the instance before accessing related objects\nrelated_fk_objects = foo_instance.fk_rev.all()\nrelated_m2m_objects = foo_instance.m2m.all()\n```\n\n- If the `#17541 patch` contains relevant fixes, review the changes and incorporate them into the `Foo` model or the related descriptors and fields as necessary.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 1 - 76](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L1-L76)\n\n This file contains the descriptors for related objects, which are likely involved in the handling of reverse foreign key and many-to-many relationships.

                "code": "\"\"\"\nAccessors for related objects.\n\nWhen a field defines a relation between two models, each model class provides\nan attribute to access related instances of the other model class (unless the\nreverse accessor has been disabled with related_name='+').\n\nAccessors are implemented as descriptors in order to customize access and\nassignment. This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",
