    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the AttributeError `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'xmin'` suggests that a bounding box object expected to have an `xmin` attribute is `None`. This issue likely arises from the interaction between `tight_layout` and the animation setup, particularly when blitting is used. The error occurs during the initialization of the animation, which suggests that the bounding box is not being computed or is being incorrectly invalidated.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- Ensure that `fig.tight_layout()` is called before the animation starts and after the figure and axes have been fully set up, including setting any axis limits, labels, and titles.\n- If `fig.tight_layout()` is called within the animation update function, ensure that it is only called after all the necessary elements of the figure have been drawn and are not `None`.\n- Check if the animation's blitting is correctly managed. Blitting requires careful handling of the figure's background and the artists that are redrawn. Ensure that the background is captured after the figure is fully drawn and before the animation loop starts.\n- If the issue persists, consider disabling blitting by setting `blit=False` in the `FuncAnimation` call to see if the issue is related to blitting. If the error goes away, the problem is likely with the blitting setup.\n- Review recent changes in the commit `396a010a6147e232d7ab101db9e4b5c6a48d0b36` to identify any modifications that could have affected the bounding box calculations or the `tight_layout` method.\n- If the animation involves resizing the figure or changing the DPI settings, ensure that the background is recaptured after such changes, as shown in the `blitting.py` example where the `draw_event` callback is used to handle resizes correctly.\n\nIn summary, the solution involves reviewing the order of operations related to `tight_layout` and blitting in the animation setup and ensuring that the bounding box is correctly computed and not `None` when accessed.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [lib](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/tree//lib) \u2192 [matplotlib](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/tree//lib/matplotlib)- [Lines 1 - 92](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/blob//lib/matplotlib/animation.py#L1-L92)\n\n This file contains the animation module where the error seems to originate, specifically in the setup of blitting.\n-  \u2192 [galleries](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/tree//galleries) \u2192 [users_explain](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/tree//galleries/users_explain) \u2192 [animations](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/tree//galleries/users_explain/animations)- [Lines 1 - 89](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/blob//galleries/users_explain/animations/blitting.py#L1-L89)\n\n This snippet explains blitting in detail, which is relevant to the traceback error related to blitting. \n\n\n   - [Lines 90 - 123](https://github.com/testbed/matplotlib__matplotlib__3.5/blob//galleries/users_explain/animations/blitting.py#L90-L123)\n\n This snippet discusses the blitting process and potential issues when the size of the figure changes, which could be related to the error.",

For example, the\n:mod:`.animation` and :mod:`.widgets` modules use blitting\ninternally. Here, we demonstrate how to implement your own blitting, outside\nof these classes.\n\nBlitting speeds up repetitive drawing by rendering all non-changing\ngraphic elements into a background image once. Then, for every draw, only the\nchanging elements need to be drawn onto this background. For example,\nif the limits of an Axes have not changed, we can render the empty Axes\nincluding all ticks and labels once, and only draw the changing data later.\n\nThe strategy is\n\n- Prepare the constant background:\n\n  - Draw the figure, but exclude all artists that you want to animate by\n    marking them as *animated* (see `.Artist.set_animated`).\n  - Save a copy of the RBGA buffer.\n\n- Render the individual images:\n\n  - Restore the copy of the RGBA buffer.\n  - Redraw the animated artists using `.Axes.draw_artist` /\n    `.Figure.draw_artist`.\n  - Show the resulting image on the screen.\n\nOne consequence of this procedure is that your animated artists are always\ndrawn on top of the static artists.\n\nNot all backends support blitting.  You can check if a given canvas does via\nthe `.FigureCanvasBase.supports_blit` property.\n\n.. warning::\n\n   This code does not work with the OSX backend (but does work with other\n   GUI backends on Mac).\n\nMinimal example\n---------------\n\nWe can use the `.FigureCanvasAgg` methods\n`~.FigureCanvasAgg.copy_from_bbox` and\n`~.FigureCanvasAgg.restore_region` in conjunction with setting\n``animated=True`` on our artist to implement a minimal example that\nuses blitting to accelerate rendering\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# animated=True tells matplotlib to only draw the artist when we\n# explicitly request it\n(ln,) = ax.plot(x, np.sin(x), animated=True)\n\n# make sure the window is raised, but the script keeps going\nplt.show(block=False)\n\n# stop to admire our empty window axes and ensure it is rendered at\n# least once.\n#\n# We need to fully draw the figure at its final size on the screen\n# before we continue on so that :\n#  a) we have the correctly sized and drawn background to grab\n#  b) we have a cached renderer so that ``ax.draw_artist`` works\n# so we spin the event loop to let the backend process any pending operations\nplt.pause(0.1)\n\n# get copy of entire figure (everything inside fig.bbox) sans animated artist\nbg = fig.canvas.copy_from_bbox(fig.bbox)\n# draw the animated artist, this uses a cached renderer\nax.draw_artist(ln)\n# show the result to the screen, this pushes the updated RGBA buffer from the",

An\nanimation is a sequence of frames where each frame corresponds to a plot on a\n`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`. This tutorial covers a general guideline on\nhow to create such animations and the different options available.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.animation as animation\n\n# %%\n# Animation Classes\n# =================\n#\n# The animation process in Matplotlib can be thought of in 2 different ways:\n#\n# - `~matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation`: Generate data for first\n#   frame and then modify this data for each frame to create an animated plot.\n#\n# - `~matplotlib.animation.ArtistAnimation`: Generate a list (iterable)\n#   of artists that will draw in each frame in the animation.\n#\n# `~matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` is more efficient in terms of\n# speed and memory as it draws an artist once and then modifies it. On the\n# other hand `~matplotlib.animation.ArtistAnimation` is flexible as it\n# allows any iterable of artists to be animated in a sequence.\n#\n# ``FuncAnimation``\n# -----------------\n#\n# The `~matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` class allows us to create an\n# animation by passing a function that iteratively modifies the data of a plot.\n# This is achieved by using the *setter* methods on various\n# `~matplotlib.artist.Artist` (examples: `~matplotlib.lines.Line2D`,\n# `~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`, etc.). A usual\n# `~matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation` object takes a\n# `~matplotlib.figure.Figure` that we want to animate and a function\n# *func* that modifies the data plotted on the figure. It uses the *frames*\n# parameter to determine the length of the animation. The *interval* parameter\n# is used to determine time in milliseconds between drawing of two frames.\n# Animating using `.FuncAnimation` would usually follow the following\n# structure:\n#\n# - Plot the initial figure, including all the required artists. Save all the\n#   artists in variables so that they can be updated later on during the\n#   animation.\n# - Create an animation function that updates the data in each artist to\n#   generate the new frame at each function call.\n# - Create a `.FuncAnimation` object with the `.Figure` and the animation\n#   function, along with the keyword arguments that determine the animation\n#   properties.\n# - Use `.animation.Animation.save` or `.pyplot.show` to save or show the\n#   animation.\n#\n# The update function uses the ``set_*`` function for different artists to\n# modify the data. The following table shows a few plotting methods, the artist\n# types they return and some methods that can be used to update them.\n#",

For example, the\n:mod:`.animation` and :mod:`.widgets` modules use blitting\ninternally. Here, we demonstrate how to implement your own blitting, outside\nof these classes.\n\nBlitting speeds up repetitive drawing by rendering all non-changing\ngraphic elements into a background image once. Then, for every draw, only the\nchanging elements need to be drawn onto this background. For example,\nif the limits of an Axes have not changed, we can render the empty Axes\nincluding all ticks and labels once, and only draw the changing data later.\n\nThe strategy is\n\n- Prepare the constant background:\n\n  - Draw the figure, but exclude all artists that you want to animate by\n    marking them as *animated* (see `.Artist.set_animated`).\n  - Save a copy of the RBGA buffer.\n\n- Render the individual images:\n\n  - Restore the copy of the RGBA buffer.\n  - Redraw the animated artists using `.Axes.draw_artist` /\n    `.Figure.draw_artist`.\n  - Show the resulting image on the screen.\n\nOne consequence of this procedure is that your animated artists are always\ndrawn on top of the static artists.\n\nNot all backends support blitting.  You can check if a given canvas does via\nthe `.FigureCanvasBase.supports_blit` property.\n\n.. warning::\n\n   This code does not work with the OSX backend (but does work with other\n   GUI backends on Mac).\n\nMinimal example\n---------------\n\nWe can use the `.FigureCanvasAgg` methods\n`~.FigureCanvasAgg.copy_from_bbox` and\n`~.FigureCanvasAgg.restore_region` in conjunction with setting\n``animated=True`` on our artist to implement a minimal example that\nuses blitting to accelerate rendering\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# animated=True tells matplotlib to only draw the artist when we\n# explicitly request it\n(ln,) = ax.plot(x, np.sin(x), animated=True)\n\n# make sure the window is raised, but the script keeps going\nplt.show(block=False)\n\n# stop to admire our empty window axes and ensure it is rendered at\n# least once.\n#\n# We need to fully draw the figure at its final size on the screen\n# before we continue on so that :\n#  a) we have the correctly sized and drawn background to grab\n#  b) we have a cached renderer so that ``ax.draw_artist`` works\n# so we spin the event loop to let the backend process any pending operations\nplt.pause(0.1)\n\n# get copy of entire figure (everything inside fig.bbox) sans animated artist\nbg = fig.canvas.copy_from_bbox(fig.bbox)\n# draw the animated artist, this uses a cached renderer\nax.draw_artist(ln)\n# show the result to the screen, this pushes the updated RGBA buffer from the",
