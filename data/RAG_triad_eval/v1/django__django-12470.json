    "mayil_response": "- Ensure that the `Child` model explicitly defines its own `Meta` class with the desired `ordering` attribute, as the `Meta` class is not inherited by child models in Django. This will override the default ordering inherited from the `Parent` model.\n\n```python\nclass Child(Parent):\n    # ... fields ...\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = [\"-pk\"]  # Ensure this matches the desired ordering\n```\n\n- If the `Child` model should inherit the `ordering` from the `Parent` model and it's not doing so, it might be due to a bug or an issue with the Django version you are using. Check the Django documentation or release notes for any known issues or changes related to model inheritance and the `Meta` class. If it's a bug, consider updating to a newer version of Django or filing a bug report.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 405 - 1949](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L405-L1949)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' contains logic for ordering query results, which is directly related to the issue of incorrect ordering in inherited models.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 2218 - 2553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L2218-L2553)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/base.py' includes validation for the 'ordering' field in model Meta classes, which may be relevant to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model is correctly inherited by the child model. \n\n\n   - [Lines 70 - 2217](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L70-L2217)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/base.py' contains checks for the 'ordering' option in model Meta classes, which is relevant to the issue as it may help identify if there's a problem with how ordering is defined or inherited.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 448 - 1694](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L448-L1694)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/expressions.py' defines methods for reversing the ordering direction, which could be relevant if the issue is related to how the ordering direction is interpreted or applied.",

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",

It also assumes that the `Child` model does not already have a `Meta` class defined, which may not be the case. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is quite comprehensive, it is not exhaustive in covering all aspects of the described bug.",

        "result": "- Ensure that the `Child` model explicitly defines its own `Meta` class with the desired `ordering` attribute, as the `Meta` class is not inherited by child models in Django. This will override the default ordering inherited from the `Parent` model.\n\n```python\nclass Child(Parent):\n    # ... fields ...\n\n    class Meta:\n        ordering = [\"-pk\"]  # Ensure this matches the desired ordering\n```\n\n- If the `Child` model should inherit the `ordering` from the `Parent` model and it's not doing so, it might be due to a bug or an issue with the Django version you are using. Check the Django documentation or release notes for any known issues or changes related to model inheritance and the `Meta` class. If it's a bug, consider updating to a newer version of Django or filing a bug report.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 405 - 1949](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L405-L1949)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' contains logic for ordering query results, which is directly related to the issue of incorrect ordering in inherited models.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 2218 - 2553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L2218-L2553)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/base.py' includes validation for the 'ordering' field in model Meta classes, which may be relevant to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model is correctly inherited by the child model. \n\n\n   - [Lines 70 - 2217](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L70-L2217)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/base.py' contains checks for the 'ordering' option in model Meta classes, which is relevant to the issue as it may help identify if there's a problem with how ordering is defined or inherited.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 448 - 1694](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L448-L1694)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/expressions.py' defines methods for reversing the ordering direction, which could be relevant if the issue is related to how the ordering direction is interpreted or applied.",
