    "mayil_response": "The issue described in the ticket is likely due to the numerical precision and the way the `sympy.linsolve` function handles floating-point numbers in the equations. The system of equations provided in the examples is nearly singular (or ill-conditioned), which means that small changes in the coefficients can lead to large changes in the solution or to a different classification of the system (e.g., from having a unique solution to having infinitely many solutions).\n\nHere's a high-level overview of what might be happening:\n\n- The first and third systems are being treated as if they have no solution other than the trivial solution (0, 0), which suggests that the system is being considered singular or nearly singular.\n- The second system is returning a parametric solution with `y` as a free parameter, which suggests that the system is being considered underdetermined with infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe difference in behavior for these very similar systems is likely due to the floating-point arithmetic and the internal thresholds used by `sympy` to decide when a system is singular or nearly singular.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider the following:\n\n- Use exact rational numbers instead of floating-point numbers if possible.\n- Increase the precision of floating-point numbers to reduce the impact of numerical errors.\n- Use a different method to solve the system that is more robust to numerical issues, such as singular value decomposition (SVD).\n\nHere is an example of how you might use exact rational numbers:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x, y')\n\n# Using Rational numbers instead of floating-point\neq1 = sympy.Eq(y, x)\neq2 = sympy.Eq(y, sympy.Rational(215, 10000) * x)\n\nsolution = sympy.linsolve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))\n```\n\nThis should give you a consistent solution for similar systems.",

The system of equations provided in the examples is nearly singular (or ill-conditioned), which means that small changes in the coefficients can lead to large changes in the solution or to a different classification of the system (e.g., from having a unique solution to having infinitely many solutions).\n\nHere's a high-level overview of what might be happening:\n\n- The first and third systems are being treated as if they have no solution other than the trivial solution (0, 0), which suggests that the system is being considered singular or nearly singular.\n- The second system is returning a parametric solution with `y` as a free parameter, which suggests that the system is being considered underdetermined with infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe difference in behavior for these very similar systems is likely due to the floating-point arithmetic and the internal thresholds used by `sympy` to decide when a system is singular or nearly singular.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider the following:\n\n- Use exact rational numbers instead of floating-point numbers if possible.\n- Increase the precision of floating-point numbers to reduce the impact of numerical errors.\n- Use a different method to solve the system that is more robust to numerical issues, such as singular value decomposition (SVD).\n\nHere is an example of how you might use exact rational numbers:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x, y')\n\n# Using Rational numbers instead of floating-point\neq1 = sympy.Eq(y, x)\neq2 = sympy.Eq(y, sympy.Rational(215, 10000) * x)\n\nsolution = sympy.linsolve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))\n```\n\nThis should give you a consistent solution for similar systems.",

Additionally, it provides an example of how to use exact rational numbers, which adds value to the RESPONSE. However, it does not fully explore why the second system behaves differently from the first and third, nor does it provide a direct solution to the inconsistency between the three systems. Therefore, while the RESPONSE is highly relevant and offers clear explanations and suggestions, it is not entirely comprehensive in addressing the specific differences between the systems.",

        "result": "The issue described in the ticket is likely due to the numerical precision and the way the `sympy.linsolve` function handles floating-point numbers in the equations. The system of equations provided in the examples is nearly singular (or ill-conditioned), which means that small changes in the coefficients can lead to large changes in the solution or to a different classification of the system (e.g., from having a unique solution to having infinitely many solutions).\n\nHere's a high-level overview of what might be happening:\n\n- The first and third systems are being treated as if they have no solution other than the trivial solution (0, 0), which suggests that the system is being considered singular or nearly singular.\n- The second system is returning a parametric solution with `y` as a free parameter, which suggests that the system is being considered underdetermined with infinitely many solutions.\n\nThe difference in behavior for these very similar systems is likely due to the floating-point arithmetic and the internal thresholds used by `sympy` to decide when a system is singular or nearly singular.\n\nTo address this issue, you might consider the following:\n\n- Use exact rational numbers instead of floating-point numbers if possible.\n- Increase the precision of floating-point numbers to reduce the impact of numerical errors.\n- Use a different method to solve the system that is more robust to numerical issues, such as singular value decomposition (SVD).\n\nHere is an example of how you might use exact rational numbers:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nx, y = sympy.symbols('x, y')\n\n# Using Rational numbers instead of floating-point\neq1 = sympy.Eq(y, x)\neq2 = sympy.Eq(y, sympy.Rational(215, 10000) * x)\n\nsolution = sympy.linsolve([eq1, eq2], (x, y))\n```\n\nThis should give you a consistent solution for similar systems.",

            "reason": "Criteria: The response is relevant and answers the entire prompt completely.\nSupporting Evidence: The response directly addresses the user's question about the inconsistent solutions returned by `sympy.linsolve` for similar systems of equations. It provides a clear explanation of the potential causes related to numerical precision and the behavior of floating-point arithmetic within the `sympy` library. The response also offers practical solutions to the problem, such as using exact rational numbers or increasing the precision of floating-point numbers, and even includes an example of how to implement one of these solutions. This demonstrates a complete and relevant answer to the entire prompt."
