    "body": "PR #10482 made it so that if a fixture calls `skip()`, the skip location is shown as the test function, not the fixture. But it excluded xunit setup fixtures from this.\r\n    \r\nI suspect this was done to make a pre-existing test pass, however I think that the same reason for fixtures applies to xunit fixtures just as well, so we shouldn't exclude it.\r\n    \r\nWould also remove a string-hack that was used to implement this exclusion...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/bf451d47a1b3be80a7f89b3076e4816c47390037/src/_pytest/fixtures.py#L1162-L1168\n",
