    "body": "### Bug description\n\nSimply importing exceptions from the [`ccxt`](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library is giving this error. Here's an example of how we import them:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom ccxt.base.errors import (\r\n    AuthenticationError,\r\n    ExchangeError,\r\n    ExchangeNotAvailable,\r\n    NetworkError,\r\n    RateLimitExceeded,\r\n    RequestTimeout,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPycharm can find the exception classes just fine. I know they exist. It could have something to do with how the library is using `__all__`, but I don't know too much about how that works to draw that conclusion.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that we're using version 1.95.1 of `ccxt`. We use it in some critical paths, so we can't update it to the latest version quite yet.\r\n\r\nThe configuration written below is what I've tried, but it seems based on googling that that doesn't stop all errors from being ignored regarding those modules. So I'm still getting the issue.\n\n### Configuration\n\n```ini\n# List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked\r\n# (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime\r\n# and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis). It\r\n# supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.\r\nignored-modules=ccxt,ccxt.base,ccxt.base.errors\n```\n\n\n### Command used\n\n```shell\npylint test_ccxt_base_errors.py\n```\n\n\n### Pylint output\n\n```shell\n************* Module test_ccxt_base_errors\r\ntest_ccxt_base_errors.py:1:0: E0611: No name 'errors' in module 'list' (no-name-in-module)\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo error to be reported\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.14.5\r\nastroid 2.11.7\r\nPython 3.9.16 (main, Dec  7 2022, 10:16:11)\r\n[Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)]\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\nIntel based 2019 Mac Book Pro. Mac OS 13.1 (Ventura). Fish shell.\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\nccxt==1.95.1\n",
