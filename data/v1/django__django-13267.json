    "body": "Description\n\t\nTrying to instantiate an abstract model with a foreign key worked without throwing any warnings in Django 1.8. In Django 1.9.8, this code:\nclass UserProfile(Model):\n\tuser = models.ForeignKey('auth.user')\n\tclass Meta(object):\n\t\tapp_label = 'core'\n\t\tabstract = True\nUserProfile()\nraises this exception:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n File \"<ipython-input-7-5fa4dfdf1ad9>\", line 2, in <module>\n\tUserProfile()\n File \".../.venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/db/models/base.py\", line 432, in __init__\n\tval = field.get_default()\n File \".../.venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/db/models/fields/related.py\", line 905, in get_default\n\tif isinstance(field_default, self.remote_field.model):\nTypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of classes and types\nWhile the code mentions that abstract models can not be instantiated [1], I couldn't find mention of this in the docs. Abstract models without foreign keys can still be instantiated perfectly fine.\nI couldn't find any description of this change in the Release Notes, so not sure if I missed it there or if this is maybe an undocumented backwards-incompatible change.\n[1] \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/026574e03c6b6fd20a45f97b0470afb70e41fda4/django/db/models/base.py#L284\n",

But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nTo resolve the `TypeError: isinstance() arg 2 must be a class, type, or tuple of classes and types` issue when upgrading from Django 1.8 to 1.9.8 and using an abstract model with a `ForeignKey` defined as a string reference, follow these steps:\n\n- Ensure that the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting in your Django project is correctly set to the custom user model if you have one. By default, it should be `'auth.User'` if you are using the built-in User model.\n- Update the `ForeignKey` definition in the `UserProfile` class to use the actual User model class instead of a string reference. Import the User model at the top of your models file:\n  ```python\n  from django.conf import settings\n  from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\n  ```\n- Replace the string reference in the `ForeignKey` with the actual User model:\n  ```python\n  class UserProfile(models.Model):\n      user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n      # ... other fields and Meta class\n  ```\n- If you are using a custom user model, replace `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` with the actual class, for example, `CustomUser`.\n- Ensure that all instances of `UserProfile` are not being instantiated directly since it is an abstract model. Instead, create concrete subclasses of `UserProfile` and instantiate those.\n- Run migrations to apply any changes to the database schema:\n  ```shell\n  python manage.py makemigrations\n  python manage.py migrate\n  ```\n- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new issues.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 462 - 506](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L462-L506)\n\n This snippet contains the check for abstract models and raises a TypeError if an abstract model is instantiated, which is directly related to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 1529 - 1777](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1529-L1777)\n\n This snippet is part of the related.py file and deals with foreign key relationships, which could be relevant to the issue since the error occurs when checking the type of the foreign key's remote field model.",

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",

By default, it should be `'auth.User'` if you are using the built-in User model.\n- Update the `ForeignKey` definition in the `UserProfile` class to use the actual User model class instead of a string reference. Import the User model at the top of your models file:\n  ```python\n  from django.conf import settings\n  from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\n  ```\n- Replace the string reference in the `ForeignKey` with the actual User model:\n  ```python\n  class UserProfile(models.Model):\n      user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n      # ... other fields and Meta class\n  ```\n- If you are using a custom user model, replace `settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` with the actual class, for example, `CustomUser`.\n- Ensure that all instances of `UserProfile` are not being instantiated directly since it is an abstract model. Instead, create concrete subclasses of `UserProfile` and instantiate those.\n- Run migrations to apply any changes to the database schema:\n  ```shell\n  python manage.py makemigrations\n  python manage.py migrate\n  ```\n- Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the changes have not introduced any new issues.",

It suggests ensuring the 'AUTH_USER_MODEL' setting is correct, updating the ForeignKey definition to use the actual User model class, avoiding direct instantiation of the abstract model, and running migrations. These are actionable steps that could potentially resolve the issue. However, the RESPONSE does not address the specific TypeError mentioned in the PROMPT, which is related to the use of a string reference for the ForeignKey in the abstract model. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to check, which could be helpful, but it does not provide a direct solution to the TypeError problem. Therefore, the RESPONSE is only partially relevant and incomplete in addressing the full scope of the described bug.",
