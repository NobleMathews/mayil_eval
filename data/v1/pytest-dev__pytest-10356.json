    "mayil_response": "- To ensure that `TestDings` inherits both `foo` and `bar` markers from `Foo` and `Bar` respectively, modify the `BaseMeta` metaclass to aggregate and deduplicate markers from the MRO.\n- Implement the `pytestmark` property in `BaseMeta` to collect markers from all base classes, using `itertools.chain.from_iterable` to flatten the list of markers and a set to deduplicate them.\n- Ensure that the `pytestmark` setter in `BaseMeta` properly sets the markers for the class.\n- To maintain Python 2/3 compatibility, use the `six` library or a conditional check to define the metaclass syntax appropriately.\n- Example implementation for `BaseMeta`:\n  ```python\n  import itertools\n  from six import with_metaclass\n\n  class BaseMeta(type):\n      @property\n      def pytestmark(cls):\n          marks = itertools.chain.from_iterable(\n              getattr(base, '_pytestmark', []) for base in cls.__mro__\n          )\n          unique_marks = list(dict.fromkeys(marks))  # Deduplicate while preserving order\n          return unique_marks\n\n      @pytestmark.setter\n      def pytestmark(cls, value):\n          cls._pytestmark = value\n\n  class Base(with_metaclass(BaseMeta)):\n      pass\n\n  @pytest.mark.foo\n  class Foo(Base):\n      pass\n\n  @pytest.mark.bar\n  class Bar(Base):\n      pass\n\n  class TestDings(Foo, Bar):\n      def test_dings(self):\n          pass\n  ```\n- Ensure that the `pytestmark` attribute is initialized as a list in the base classes if they are going to be used with the metaclass.\n- Test the solution with pytest versions 3-6 to confirm that the `test_dings` method in `TestDings` has both `foo` and `bar` markers.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//.github) \u2192 [ISSUE_TEMPLATE](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)- [Lines 1 - 5](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml#L1-L5)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it pertains to the GitHub issue template configuration, not the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n-  \u2192 [.github](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//.github)- [Lines 1 - 2](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//.github/config.yml#L1-L2)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is related to the ReadTheDocs configuration for the pytest documentation.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 14](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//bench/manyparam.py#L1-L14)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a benchmarking script unrelated to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 9](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//bench/skip.py#L1-L9)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a benchmarking script unrelated to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n- - [Lines 2 - 72](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//.pre-commit-config.yaml#L2-L72)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a configuration file for pre-commit hooks, not related to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n-  \u2192 [scripts](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//scripts)- [Lines 99 - 171](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//scripts/update-plugin-list.py#L99-L171)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a script for updating plugin lists, not related to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n-  \u2192 [src](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//src)- [Lines 1 - 10](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//src/py.py#L1-L10)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a shim for pylib compatibility, not related to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n- - [Lines 1 - 6](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//codecov.yml#L1-L6)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a configuration file for Codecov, not related to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 11](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//bench/xunit.py#L1-L11)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a benchmarking script unrelated to the pytest marker inheritance problem.\n-  \u2192 [extra](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/tree//extra)- [Lines 1 - 85](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.2/blob//extra/get_issues.py#L1-L85)\n\n This snippet is not relevant to the issue as it is a script for retrieving GitHub issues, not related to the pytest marker inheritance problem.",
