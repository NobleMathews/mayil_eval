The RESPONSE suggests modifying the __copy__ method to return an HDUList instance, which is a direct and relevant solution to the issue. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a code snippet showing the exact change needed, which is to replace 'return self[:]' with 'return HDUList(self)'. This change is logical and aligns with the expected behavior of the copy method. The RESPONSE also advises ensuring that the HDUList constructor can handle being passed another HDUList instance, which is a sensible precaution to ensure the solution is robust. Lastly, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code snippets in the repository, which would be helpful for a developer looking to implement the fix.",
