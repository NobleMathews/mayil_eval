    "mayil_response": "- The diff snippet indicates that the condition in the `multiset_permutations` function is being modified to handle empty lists. The condition should check if `do` is not set and either `size` is `None` or `size` is less than 1, then it should yield an empty list and return.\n- The test cases in `test_iterables.py` are checking that `multiset_permutations` returns `[[]]` for an empty input and `[]` for an empty input with `size` set to 1.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n- Ensure that the `multiset_permutations` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` includes the updated condition to handle empty lists correctly.\n- The condition should be placed at the beginning of the function to check for an empty input and return immediately if necessary.\n- The function should yield an empty list `[]` and return when the input is empty or when `size` is less than 1.\n\nHere is the updated code snippet for the `multiset_permutations` function:\n\n```python\ndef multiset_permutations(multiset, size=None):\n    # ... (other code and comments) ...\n    \n    # Handle empty multiset or size < 1\n    if not multiset and (size is None or size < 1):\n        yield []\n        return\n    \n    # ... (rest of the function) ...\n```\n\n- Ensure that the test cases in `sympy/utilities/tests/test_iterables.py` pass with the updated function.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/tree//sympy) \u2192 [utilities](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/tree//sympy/utilities)- [Lines 1626 - 1651](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/blob//sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L1626-L1651)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for handling multiset permutations when the input is an integer, which is closely related to the issue at hand. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1653 - 1703](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/blob//sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L1653-L1703)\n\n This snippet includes logic for handling cases where the multiset has no variety, which might be relevant when considering empty or single-element multisets. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1549 - 1549](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/blob//sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L1549-L1549)\n\n This snippet is the function definition for multiset_partitions, which is directly related to the issue as the bug fix is within this function. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1287 - 1380](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/blob//sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L1287-L1380)\n\n This snippet contains the multiset_combinations function, which could be relevant to the issue since it deals with combinations of multisets and might be affected by the handling of empty multisets. \n\n\n   - [Lines 23 - 1625](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.9/blob//sympy/utilities/iterables.py#L23-L1625)\n\n This snippet provides the documentation and examples for the multiset_partitions function, which is relevant to understanding the expected behavior and could be useful for updating the documentation after the bug fix.",
