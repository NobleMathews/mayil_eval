    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to a crash that occurs when no template is provided to the pylint tool. The relevant code snippet is from `pylint/lint/utils.py` where the `prepare_crash_report` function is defined. This function attempts to create a crash report when an exception occurs, but it seems to be failing when the `issue_template_path` does not exist.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- Modify the `prepare_crash_report` function to ensure that it does not crash when no template is provided.\n- Add a check to see if `issue_template_path` exists before attempting to open and write to it.\n- If the `issue_template_path` does not exist, create it before writing the template content.\n\nHere is the modified code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef prepare_crash_report(ex: Exception, filepath: str, crash_file_path: str) -> Path:\n    issue_template_path = (\n        Path(PYLINT_HOME) / datetime.now().strftime(str(crash_file_path))\n    ).resolve()\n    with open(filepath, encoding=\"utf8\") as f:\n        file_content = f.read()\n    template = \"\"\n    # Ensure the directory for issue_template_path exists before writing the file\n    issue_template_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n    if not issue_template_path.exists():\n        template = \"\"\"\\\nFirst, please verify that the bug is not already filled:\nhttps://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/\n\nThen create a new issue:\nhttps://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/new?labels=Crash \ud83d\udca5%2CNeeds triage \ud83d\udce5\n\n\n\"\"\"\n    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...\n```\n\nBy adding `issue_template_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`, we ensure that the directory for the issue template path is created if it does not exist, which should prevent the crash when attempting to write to a non-existent path.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint) \u2192 [lint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/lint)- [Lines 1 - 138](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/lint/utils.py#L1-L138)\n\n This snippet contains the function `prepare_crash_report` which is likely involved in handling crashes when no template is provided. It is relevant to understand how the crash report is being prepared and to fix the issue if the crash is related to the template handling.",
