    "mayil_response": "- The issue is that `Rationals.contains(0.5)` returns `False` instead of `True`.\n- The relevant code snippet is from `sympy/sets/fancysets.py` in the `Rationals` class, specifically the `_contains` method.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n- Modify the `_contains` method in the `Rationals` class to handle floating-point numbers correctly by converting them to `Rational` before checking if they are rational.\n- The updated `_contains` method should look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import Rational\n\nclass Rationals(Set, metaclass=Singleton):\n    ...\n    def _contains(self, other):\n        if not isinstance(other, Expr):\n            return False\n        if isinstance(other, float):  # Handle float inputs\n            other = Rational(other)\n        if other.is_Number:\n            return other.is_Rational\n        return other.is_rational\n    ...\n```\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/tree//sympy) \u2192 [sets](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/tree//sympy/sets)- [Lines 1 - 68](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/blob//sympy/sets/fancysets.py#L1-L68)\n\n This snippet contains the Rationals class and the _contains method which is responsible for checking if a number is in the Rationals set. The issue is related to this method incorrectly returning False for floating point numbers that should be considered rational.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 1506 - 1595](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/blob//sympy/core/numbers.py#L1506-L1595)\n\n This snippet defines the Rational class and how it handles float inputs. It may be relevant to understand how floating point numbers are converted to Rational objects, which could be related to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1018 - 1029](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/blob//sympy/core/numbers.py#L1018-L1029)\n\n This snippet defines the Float class and its properties. It is relevant to understand the properties of Float objects when investigating why they are not recognized as rational by the Rationals class.",

(Auto-\n    counting is only allowed for strings, ints and longs).\n\n    >>> Float('123 456 789.123_456', '')\n    123456789.123456\n    >>> Float('12e-3', '')\n    0.012\n    >>> Float(3, '')\n    3.\n\n    If a number is written in scientific notation, only the digits before the\n    exponent are considered significant if a decimal appears, otherwise the\n    \"e\" signifies only how to move the decimal:\n\n    >>> Float('60.e2', '')  # 2 digits significant\n    6.0e+3\n    >>> Float('60e2', '')  # 4 digits significant\n    6000.\n    >>> Float('600e-2', '')  # 3 digits significant\n    6.00\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Floats are inexact by their nature unless their value is a binary-exact\n    value.\n\n    >>> approx, exact = Float(.1, 1), Float(.125, 1)\n\n    For calculation purposes, evalf needs to be able to change the precision\n    but this will not increase the accuracy of the inexact value. The\n    following is the most accurate 5-digit approximation of a value of 0.1\n    that had only 1 digit of precision:\n\n    >>> approx.evalf(5)\n    0.099609\n\n    By contrast, 0.125 is exact in binary (as it is in base 10) and so it\n    can be passed to Float or evalf to obtain an arbitrary precision with\n    matching accuracy:\n\n    >>> Float(exact, 5)\n    0.12500\n    >>> exact.evalf(20)\n    0.12500000000000000000\n\n    Trying to make a high-precision Float from a float is not disallowed,\n    but one must keep in mind that the *underlying float* (not the apparent\n    decimal value) is being obtained with high precision. For example, 0.3\n    does not have a finite binary representation. The closest rational is\n    the fraction 5404319552844595/2**54. So if you try to obtain a Float of\n    0.3 to 20 digits of precision you will not see the same thing as 0.3\n    followed by 19 zeros:\n\n    >>> Float(0.3, 20)\n    0.29999999999999998890\n\n    If you want a 20-digit value of the decimal 0.3 (not the floating point\n    approximation of 0.3) you should send the 0.3 as a string. The underlying\n    representation is still binary but a higher precision than Python's float\n    is used:\n\n    >>> Float('0.3', 20)\n    0.30000000000000000000\n\n    Although you can increase the precision of an existing Float using Float\n    it will not increase the accuracy -- the underlying value is not changed:\n\n    >>> def show(f): # binary rep of Float\n    ...     from sympy import Mul, Pow\n    ...     s, m, e, b = f._mpf_\n    ...     v = Mul(int(m), Pow(2, int(e), evaluate=False), evaluate=False)\n    ...     print('%s at prec=%s' % (v, f._prec))\n    ...\n    >>> t = Float('0.3', 3)\n    >>> show(t)\n    4915/2**14 at prec=13\n    >>> show(Float(t, 20)) # higher prec, not higher accuracy\n    4915/2**14 at prec=70\n    >>> show(Float(t, 2)) # lower prec\n    307/2**10 at prec=10\n\n    The same thing happens when evalf is used on a Float:\n\n    >>> show(t.evalf(20))\n    4915/2**14 at prec=70\n    >>> show(t.evalf(2))\n    307/2**10 at prec=10\n\n    Finally, Floats can be instantiated with an mpf tuple (n, c, p) to\n    produce the number (-1)**n*c*2**p:\n\n    >>> n, c, p = 1, 5, 0\n    >>> (-1)**n*c*2**p\n    -5\n    >>> Float((1, 5, 0))\n    -5.00000000000000\n\n    An actual mpf tuple also contains the number of bits in c as the last\n    element of the tuple:\n\n    >>> _._mpf_\n    (1, 5, 0, 3)\n\n    This is not needed for instantiation and is not the same thing as the\n    precision. The mpf tuple and the precision are two separate quantities\n    that Float tracks.\n\n    In SymPy, a Float is a number that can be computed with arbitrary\n    precision. Although floating point 'inf' and 'nan' are not such\n    numbers, Float can create these numbers:\n\n    >>> Float('-inf')\n    -oo\n    >>> _.is_Float\n    False\n    \"\"\"",
