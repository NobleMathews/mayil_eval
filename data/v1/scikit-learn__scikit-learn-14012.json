    "title": "Feature request: warm starting for histogram-based GBM",
    "body": "#### Description\r\nThis is a feature request to add the warm start parameter, which exists for [gradient boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier), to the new [histogram-based gradient boosting](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier).\r\n\r\nRationale: We're using gradient boosting in [Auto-sklearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/), and fit each model until either the time (given by the user) is up, or the number of trees is reached. For sufficiently large datasets, it is possible that certain configurations time out. Therefore, if possible, we train models iteratively, and only add more trees if time allows. Since the new GBM implementation is really great (not only faster, but also better default accuracy for the problems I tried) we would like to use it within Auto-sklearn as a drop-in, ideally together with iterative training.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement warm starting for the histogram-based gradient boosting machine (GBM) in scikit-learn, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `fit` method of the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` to support warm starting.\n- Add a check to see if `warm_start` is `True` and if the model has been previously fitted (i.e., `self._predictors` is not empty).\n- If warm starting, continue training from the last iteration (`self.n_iter_`) instead of starting from scratch.\n- Ensure that the `max_iter` parameter is adjusted to account for the number of iterations already completed in the previous fit.\n- Update the `self._predictors` list with the new trees that are trained during the warm start.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the changes needed in the `fit` method of the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` and `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`:\n\n```python\nclass HistGradientBoostingClassifier(BaseHistGradientBoosting):\n    # ...\n\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        # Existing initialization code ...\n\n        if self.warm_start and hasattr(self, '_predictors') and self._predictors:\n            # Warm starting is requested and the model has been previously fitted\n            begin_at_stage = self.n_iter_\n            # Adjust max_iter to account for the iterations already done\n            self.max_iter += begin_at_stage\n        else:\n            # No warm starting, or this is the first fit\n            self._predictors = []\n            begin_at_stage = 0\n\n        # Rest of the fitting code, which now starts from begin_at_stage\n        # ...\n\n        # Update self.n_iter_ to reflect the total number of iterations done\n        self.n_iter_ = begin_at_stage + n_stages_completed\n\n        return self\n```\n\n- Ensure that the `self.n_iter_` attribute is updated correctly after the fit, to reflect the total number of iterations done.\n- Add unit tests to verify that warm starting works as expected, particularly that the model continues training from where it left off and that the results are consistent with a non-warm-started model trained for the equivalent total number of iterations.\n\nFor further research and implementation details, you can refer to the scikit-learn documentation and source code, especially the implementation of warm starting in other ensemble methods like `RandomForestClassifier` and `GradientBoostingClassifier`. Additionally, you may want to look into the joblib library, which scikit-learn uses for parallelization, to understand how state is managed across multiple fits when warm starting.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/ensemble) \u2192 [_hist_gradient_boosting](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting)- [Lines 593 - 629](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting/gradient_boosting.py#L593-L629)\n\n This snippet is from the file where the histogram-based gradient boosting is implemented and contains logic related to warm starting, which is directly relevant to the feature request. \n\n\n   - [Lines 88 - 163](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting/gradient_boosting.py#L88-L163)\n\n This snippet shows the base class for histogram-based gradient boosting estimators and includes the 'warm_start' parameter, indicating where the new feature should be integrated.",

If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient\n        Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.\n        Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance\n        and an increase in bias.\n        Values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`.\n\n    criterion : {'friedman_mse', 'squared_error'}, default='friedman_mse'\n        The function to measure the quality of a split.

We specify a ``validation_fraction``\nwhich denotes the fraction of the whole dataset that will be kept aside from\ntraining to assess the validation loss of the model. The gradient boosting\nmodel is trained using the training set and evaluated using the validation set.\nWhen each additional stage of regression tree is added, the validation set is\nused to score the model.  This is continued until the scores of the model in\nthe last ``n_iter_no_change`` stages do not improve by at least `tol`. After\nthat the model is considered to have converged and further addition of stages\nis \"stopped early\".\n\nThe number of stages of the final model is available at the attribute\n``n_estimators_``.\n\nThis example illustrates how the early stopping can used in the\n:class:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` model to achieve\nalmost the same accuracy as compared to a model built without early stopping\nusing many fewer estimators. This can significantly reduce training time,\nmemory usage and prediction latency.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Authors: Vighnesh Birodkar <vighneshbirodkar@nyu.edu>\n#          Raghav RV <rvraghav93@gmail.com>\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\nimport time\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom sklearn import datasets, ensemble\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndata_list = [\n    datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True),\n    datasets.make_classification(n_samples=800, random_state=0),\n    datasets.make_hastie_10_2(n_samples=2000, random_state=0),\n]\nnames = [\"Iris Data\", \"Classification Data\", \"Hastie Data\"]\n\nn_gb = []\nscore_gb = []\ntime_gb = []\nn_gbes = []\nscore_gbes = []\ntime_gbes = []\n\nn_estimators = 200",
