    "mayil_response": "- The issue seems to be related to the `Subs` class and its method `.subs()` not handling nested substitutions correctly.\n- The relevant code snippet that likely contains the issue is in `sympy/core/function.py` within the `Subs` class definition, specifically the `_eval_subs` method.\n- To address the issue, ensure that the `_eval_subs` method in the `Subs` class correctly handles nested substitutions. This may involve checking if the substitution variable is already present in the substitution tuple and updating the method to handle such cases appropriately.\n- The solution should ensure that the `Subs` object maintains the integrity of the substitution when the `.subs()` method is called, even when a variable in the substitution tuple is itself substituted.\n- Modify the `_eval_subs` method in the `Subs` class to correctly handle the case where a variable in the substitution tuple is itself substituted, ensuring that the expected output `Subs(x + y, (a,), (z,))` is achieved when the `.subs()` method is called with the appropriate arguments.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 911 - 2340](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L911-L2340)\n\n This snippet contains the '_eval_subs' method of the 'Subs' class, which is likely where the substitution logic that is not working as expected is implemented. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 3213](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L1-L3213)\n\n This snippet provides a detailed explanation of the 'Subs' class, its purpose, and examples of usage, which could be helpful for understanding the expected behavior and identifying the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2057 - 2057](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/core/function.py#L2057-L2057)\n\n This snippet shows the declaration of the 'Subs' class, which is the class in question for the issue.

One is also able to calculate derivatives of Subs objects - in\n    this case the expression is always expanded (for the unevaluated form, use\n    Derivative()).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import Subs, Function, sin, cos\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n    >>> f = Function('f')\n\n    Subs are created when a particular substitution cannot be made. The\n    x in the derivative cannot be replaced with 0 because 0 is not a\n    valid variables of differentiation:\n\n    >>> f(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0)\n    Subs(Derivative(f(x), x), x, 0)\n\n    Once f is known, the derivative and evaluation at 0 can be done:\n\n    >>> _.subs(f, sin).doit() == sin(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0) == cos(0)\n    True\n\n    Subs can also be created directly with one or more variables:\n\n    >>> Subs(f(x)*sin(y) + z, (x, y), (0, 1))\n    Subs(z + f(x)*sin(y), (x, y), (0, 1))\n    >>> _.doit()\n    z + f(0)*sin(1)\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    In order to allow expressions to combine before doit is done, a\n    representation of the Subs expression is used internally to make\n    expressions that are superficially different compare the same:\n\n    >>> a, b = Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0)\n    >>> a + b\n    2*Subs(x, x, 0)\n\n    This can lead to unexpected consequences when using methods\n    like `has` that are cached:\n\n    >>> s = Subs(x, x, 0)\n    >>> s.has(x), s.has(y)\n    (True, False)\n    >>> ss = s.subs(x, y)\n    >>> ss.has(x), ss.has(y)\n    (True, False)\n    >>> s, ss\n    (Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0))\n    \"\"\"",

We cannot use subs, because it is just too smart for us. For\n    example::\n\n        > Omega=[exp(exp(_p - exp(-_p))/(1 - 1/_p)), exp(exp(_p))]\n        > O2=[exp(-exp(_p) + exp(-exp(-_p))*exp(_p)/(1 - 1/_p))/_w, 1/_w]\n        > e = exp(exp(_p - exp(-_p))/(1 - 1/_p)) - exp(exp(_p))\n        > e.subs(Omega[0],O2[0]).subs(Omega[1],O2[1])\n        -1/w + exp(exp(p)*exp(-exp(-p))/(1 - 1/p))\n\n    is really not what we want!\n\n    So we do it the hard way and keep track of all the things we potentially\n    want to substitute by dummy variables. Consider the expression::\n\n        exp(x - exp(-x)) + exp(x) + x.\n\n    The mrv set is {exp(x), exp(-x), exp(x - exp(-x))}.\n    We introduce corresponding dummy variables d1, d2, d3 and rewrite::\n\n        d3 + d1 + x.\n\n    This class first of all keeps track of the mapping expr->variable, i.e.\n    will at this stage be a dictionary::\n\n        {exp(x): d1, exp(-x): d2, exp(x - exp(-x)): d3}.\n\n    [It turns out to be more convenient this way round.]\n    But sometimes expressions in the mrv set have other expressions from the\n    mrv set as subexpressions, and we need to keep track of that as well. In\n    this case, d3 is really exp(x - d2), so rewrites at this stage is::\n\n        {d3: exp(x-d2)}.\n\n    The function rewrite uses all this information to correctly rewrite our\n    expression in terms of w. In this case w can be chosen to be exp(-x),\n    i.e. d2. The correct rewriting then is::\n\n        exp(-w)/w + 1/w + x.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.rewrites = {}\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return super(SubsSet, self).__repr__() + ', ' + self.rewrites.__repr__()\n\n    def __getitem__(self, key):\n        if not key in self:\n            self[key] = Dummy()\n        return dict.__getitem__(self, key)\n\n    def do_subs(self, e):\n        \"\"\"Substitute the variables with expressions\"\"\"\n        for expr, var in self.items():\n            e = e.xreplace({var: expr})\n        return e\n\n    def meets(self, s2):\n        \"\"\"Tell whether or not self and s2 have non-empty intersection\"\"\"\n        return set(self.keys()).intersection(list(s2.keys())) != set()\n\n    def union(self, s2, exps=None):\n        \"\"\"Compute the union of self and s2, adjusting exps\"\"\"\n        res = self.copy()\n        tr = {}\n        for expr, var in s2.items():\n            if expr in self:\n                if exps:\n                    exps = exps.xreplace({var: res[expr]})\n                tr[var] = res[expr]\n            else:\n                res[expr] = var\n        for var, rewr in s2.rewrites.items():\n            res.rewrites[var] = rewr.xreplace(tr)\n        return res, exps\n\n    def copy(self):\n        \"\"\"Create a shallow copy of SubsSet\"\"\"\n        r = SubsSet()\n        r.rewrites = self.rewrites.copy()\n        for expr, var in self.items():\n            r[expr] = var\n        return r",

One is also able to calculate derivatives of Subs objects - in\n    this case the expression is always expanded (for the unevaluated form, use\n    Derivative()).\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import Subs, Function, sin, cos\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n    >>> f = Function('f')\n\n    Subs are created when a particular substitution cannot be made. The\n    x in the derivative cannot be replaced with 0 because 0 is not a\n    valid variables of differentiation:\n\n    >>> f(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0)\n    Subs(Derivative(f(x), x), x, 0)\n\n    Once f is known, the derivative and evaluation at 0 can be done:\n\n    >>> _.subs(f, sin).doit() == sin(x).diff(x).subs(x, 0) == cos(0)\n    True\n\n    Subs can also be created directly with one or more variables:\n\n    >>> Subs(f(x)*sin(y) + z, (x, y), (0, 1))\n    Subs(z + f(x)*sin(y), (x, y), (0, 1))\n    >>> _.doit()\n    z + f(0)*sin(1)\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    In order to allow expressions to combine before doit is done, a\n    representation of the Subs expression is used internally to make\n    expressions that are superficially different compare the same:\n\n    >>> a, b = Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0)\n    >>> a + b\n    2*Subs(x, x, 0)\n\n    This can lead to unexpected consequences when using methods\n    like `has` that are cached:\n\n    >>> s = Subs(x, x, 0)\n    >>> s.has(x), s.has(y)\n    (True, False)\n    >>> ss = s.subs(x, y)\n    >>> ss.has(x), ss.has(y)\n    (True, False)\n    >>> s, ss\n    (Subs(x, x, 0), Subs(y, y, 0))\n    \"\"\"",
