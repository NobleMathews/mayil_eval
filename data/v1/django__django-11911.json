    "title": "\"migrate --plan\" outputs \"IRREVERSIBLE\" on RunPython operations without docstrings.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nGiven a migration like:\nfrom django.db import migrations\ndef forward(apps, schema_editor):\n\tpass\ndef reverse(apps, schema_editor):\n\tpass\nclass Migration(migrations.Migration):\n\toperations = [\n\t\tmigrations.RunPython(forward, reverse)\n\t]\nmanage.py migrate --plan will output:\nPlanned operations:\nexample.0001_initial\n\tRaw Python operation -> IRREVERSIBLE\nThe migration should not be described as \"irreversible\".\nThis error is in the definition of describe_operation in django/django/core/management/commands/migrate.py, reproduced below with line numbers from 2.2.6 tag.\n343\t@staticmethod\n344\tdef describe_operation(operation, backwards):\n345\t\t\"\"\"Return a string that describes a migration operation for --plan.\"\"\"\n346\t\tprefix = ''\n347\t\tif hasattr(operation, 'code'):\n348\t\t\tcode = operation.reverse_code if backwards else operation.code\n349\t\t\taction = code.__doc__ if code else ''\n350\t\telif hasattr(operation, 'sql'):\n351\t\t\taction = operation.reverse_sql if backwards else operation.sql\n352\t\telse:\n353\t\t\taction = ''\n354\t\t\tif backwards:\n355\t\t\t\tprefix = 'Undo '\n356\t\tif action is None:\n357\t\t\taction = 'IRREVERSIBLE'\n358\t\t\tis_error = True\n359\t\telse:\n360\t\t\taction = str(action).replace('\\n', '')\n361\t\t\tis_error = False\n362\t\tif action:\n363\t\t\taction = ' -> ' + action\n364\t\ttruncated = Truncator(action)\n365\treturn prefix + operation.describe() + truncated.chars(40), is_error\nLine 349 uses the docstring as the output string.\nLine 356 tests that value and sets action = 'IRREVERSIBLE' on line 357 because the dosctring is None.\nIt would appear that the intention is to use a docstring to describe the operation, if available, and leave it blank otherwise. However, because it tests against code instead of code.__doc__ it actually sets action = None resulting in 'IRREVERSIBLE' being displayed.\nProposed Solutions below\nFor a localized fix, I believe line 349 should be replaced by\n\t\tif code:\n\t\t\taction = code.__doc__ if code.__doc__ else ''\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\taction = None\nHowever, a more holistic view suggests that displaying \"IRREVERSIBLE\" isn't really the correct thing to do. \"IRREVERSIBLE\" is set when is_error is also set to True and seems to be trying to indicate that the migration operation is invalid rather than irreversible. That is, if code/reverse_code is None (line 348) or sql/reverse_sql is None (line 351) the migration can't run.\nSince sql and code are required parameters for their respective Operations, action should only possibly be None in the reverse case, which seems to be what this code is trying to capture and explain.\nGiven that, a better approach would probably make use of the reversible property defined on RunSQL and RunPython operations. This is a little verbose and could probably be pared down, but I think it has the right logic:\n@staticmethod\ndef describe_operation(operation, backwards):\n\t\"\"\"Return a string that describes a migration operation for --plan.\"\"\"\n\tprefix = ''\n\taction = ''\n\tis_error = False\n\tif backwards:\n\t\tprefix = 'Undo '\n\t\tif hasattr(operation, 'reversible') and not operation.reversible:\n\t\t\taction = 'INVALID'\n\t\t\tis_error = True\n\t\telif hasattr(operation, 'reverse_code'):\n\t\t\taction = operation.reverse_code.__doc__ if operation.reverse_code.__doc__ else ''\n\t\telif hasattr(operation, 'reverse_sql'):\n\t\t\taction = operation.reverse_sql.__doc__ if operation.reverse_sql.__doc__ else ''\n\telse:\n\t\tif hasattr(operation, 'code'):\n\t\t\taction = operation.code.__doc__ if operation.code.__doc__ else ''\n\t\telif hasattr(operation, 'sql'):\n\t\t\taction = operation.sql.__doc__ if operation.sql.__doc__ else ''\n\taction = ' -> ' + str(action).replace('\\n', '')\n\ttruncated = Truncator(action)\n\treturn prefix + operation.describe() + truncated.chars(40), is_error\n",
