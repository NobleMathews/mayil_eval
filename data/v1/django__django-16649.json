    "body": "Description\n\t\n(Reporting possible issue found by a user on #django)\nUsing values() to force selection of certain columns in a certain order proved useful unioning querysets with union() for the aforementioned user. The positioning of columns added with annotate() is not controllable with values() and has the potential to disrupt union() unless this fact is known and the ordering done in a certain way to accommodate it.\nI'm reporting this mainly for posterity but also as a highlight that perhaps this should be mentioned in the documentation. I'm sure there are reasons why the annotations are appended to the select but if someone feels that this is changeable then it would be a bonus outcome.\n",
