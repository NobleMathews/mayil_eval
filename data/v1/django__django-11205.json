    "body": "Description\n\t\nWhen calling count() on an unfiltered many to many relation, a useless join is included in the SQL that makes it much slower than it should be. On my dataset, the difference is 1000ms to 100ms, because an index-only scan can be used.\nThis is the SQL that is currently generated:\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS \"__count\"\nFROM \"app_foo\"\nINNER JOIN \"app_foo_bar\" ON (\"app_foo\".\"id\" = \"app_foo_bar\".\"foo_id\")\nWHERE \"app_foo_bar\".\"foo_id\" = ?;\nThis is the SQL that should be generated:\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS \"__count\"\nFROM \"app_foo_bar\"\nWHERE \"app_foo_bar\".\"foo_id\" = ?;\nThis optimization can only be applied when there are no filters applied, because then the join is used to satisfy the filters. In the no-filters case, only the through table needs to be consulted.\n",
