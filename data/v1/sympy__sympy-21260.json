    "title": "Same symbols created in different processes are not resolved as being equal",
    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhen I try to create symbols (and by extension expressions) in different processes, SymPy somehow does not detect that the symbols are the same even though they have the same name and assumptions.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider the following code snippet and the respective output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport multiprocessing as mp\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\n\r\nVAR_X = sp.Symbol('x', real=True, nonzero=True)\r\n\r\ndef process():\r\n    return sp.Symbol('x', real=True, nonzero=True)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    a1 = sp.Symbol('a', real=True, nonzero=True)\r\n    a2 = sp.Symbol('a', real=True, nonzero=True)\r\n    print(a1, a2, a1 == a2, a1 - a2, '\\n')\r\n\r\n    pool = mp.Pool(4)\r\n    jobs = []\r\n    for _ in range(5):\r\n        jobs.append(pool.apply_async(process))\r\n    symbols = []\r\n    for job in jobs:\r\n        symbols.append(job.get())\r\n    pool.close()\r\n\r\n    for s in symbols:\r\n        print(s, ' | ', VAR_X, ' | ', s - VAR_X, ' | ', sp.simplify(s - VAR_X))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\na a True 0\r\n\r\nx  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x\r\nx  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x\r\nx  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x\r\nx  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x\r\nx  |  x  |  -x + x  |  -x + x\r\n```\r\n\r\n@oscarbenjamin thinks this may be related to pickling and unpickling the symbol. Working in the same process creating two different symbols returns the\r\nexact same object:\r\n```\r\nIn [5]: x1 = Symbol('x')\r\n\r\nIn [6]: x2 = Symbol('x')\r\n\r\nIn [7]: x1 is x2\r\nOut[7]: True\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried to explicitly pickle and unpickle the symbols using the `dill` library, but this also didn't help.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I obtain two expressions (separately) from different processes, and one is integrand `f` and the other is expected integral `F` (both containing only one free symbol, `x`), SymPy manages to resolve that `simplify(F.diff() - f) == 0` and `simplify(integrate(f) - F) == 0`. Note that I **do not** pass the symbol `x` with respect to which to differentiate or integrate. If I do it, it fails. Unfortunately, I don't have a small enough code snippet readily prepared to exemplify this behaviour.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude10.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- Ensure that `Symbol` objects are created with consistent assumptions across different processes when using `mp.Pool`. If the assumptions are not consistent, this could lead to symbols not being recognized as equal.\n- When using multiprocessing, make sure that `Symbol` objects are properly pickled and unpickled. Consider using the `dill` library or ensure that the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods of the `Symbol` class are correctly implemented to handle the pickling process.\n- If using `Dummy` symbols, be aware that they are unique and will not compare equal even if they have the same name. Use regular `Symbol` objects if you need them to be equal across different processes.\n- When comparing `Symbol` objects for equality, ensure that the comparison is done after any multiprocessing tasks have been completed and the objects have been returned to the main process.\n- If the issue persists, consider creating a single `Symbol` object before starting the multiprocessing pool and passing this object explicitly to the functions that require it, rather than creating new `Symbol` objects in each subprocess. This can help maintain identity and equality checks across processes.\n- For differentiation and integration, if the issue is related to the symbol not being passed explicitly, modify the `diff` and `integrate` calls to include the symbol as an argument. For example, change `expr.diff()` to `expr.diff(x)` where `x` is the symbol with respect to which you are differentiating.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 20 - 220](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/blob//sympy/core/symbol.py#L20-L220)\n\n This snippet defines the Symbol class and its constructor, which is directly related to the issue of symbols not being resolved as equal across different processes. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 95](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/blob//sympy/core/symbol.py#L1-L95)\n\n This snippet contains the _symbol function which is used to return symbols and might be involved in the process of creating symbols that are not being resolved as equal. \n\n\n   - [Lines 304 - 366](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.8/blob//sympy/core/symbol.py#L304-L366)\n\n This snippet defines the Dummy class which is a subclass of Symbol. It might be relevant to understand how Dummy symbols are handled differently and if this behavior affects the issue.",

The RESPONSE also suggests checking the Symbol class implementation and the handling of Dummy symbols, which is somewhat relevant but does not offer a direct solution to the problem. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a suggestion to modify the diff and integrate calls to include the symbol as an argument, which is not directly related to the issue of symbol equality across processes.",
