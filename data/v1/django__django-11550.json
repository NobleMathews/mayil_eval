    "title": "order_by() on union() querysets results with wrong ordering when the same field type is presented multiple times.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nWhen doing a union of 2 querysets and then doing an order_by on the resulting queryset, if we order on a field whose type is present multiple time, the ordering will be incorrect if the field we sort on is not the 1st field of the query. Explicitly settings values with .values('field1', 'field2') on the base querysets or after the union has no effect.\nFor instance, with this model, with 2 DecimalFields and one BooleanField:\nclass Listing(models.Model):\n\tsale_price = models.DecimalField('Sale price', max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n\tyearly_rent = models.DecimalField('Yearly rent', max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n\ttoto = models.BooleanField()\n# Create 2 qs.\nqs1 = Listing.objects.all()\nqs2 = Listing.objects.all()\n# Create the union QS.\nqs3 = qs1.union(qs2)\n# Order on the 1st decimal field. This prints (which is correct) :\n# SELECT \"union_listing\".\"id\", \"union_listing\".\"sale_price\", \"union_listing\".\"yearly_rent\" FROM \"union_listing\" UNION SELECT \"union_listing\".\"id\", \"union_listing\".\"sale_price\", \"union_listing\".\"yearly_rent\" FROM \"union_listing\" ORDER BY (2) ASC\nprint(qs3.order_by('sale_price').query)\n# Order on the 2nd deciamal field. This will print the same query as above which is incorrect.\nprint(qs3.order_by('yearly_rent').query)\n# Not ordering on a DecimalField. This is correct again.\nprint(qs3.order_by('toto').query)\nFrom the debugging I did, it seems to come from \u200bthis commit: If I revert def __eq__ back to what it was in Django 2.1 (\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.1.x/django/db/models/expressions.py#L363) it works as normal again. The difference between the two methods that can explain this is that in Django 2.1, we have a check on the actual field instances thanks to other_args[1], but in 2.2, because of identity[2][1] which is the class of the field, we can't distinguish two fields of the same type (please refer to the respective implementations to know the values of other_args and identity).\n\u200bSample projet to reproduce (sqlite db included) (\u200bModel, \u200btest file). Steps:\nInstall Django 2.2\nRun DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=testunion.settings python test-script.py\nYou will see the queries for qs3.order_by('sale_price') and qs3.order_by('yearly_rent') They are exactly the same whereas they should be different (one with ORDER BY (1) and the other with ORDER BY (2)).\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to incorrect ordering when using `order_by()` on a `union()` of querysets in Django 2.2, which was not present in Django 2.1. The problem is related to the `__eq__` method in `expressions.py`. To address this issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `OrderBy` class in `expressions.py` has a properly implemented `__eq__` method that can correctly compare `OrderBy` instances, including cases where the instances are part of a union queryset.\n- If the `__eq__` method was changed between Django 2.1 and 2.2, consider reverting to the Django 2.1 implementation if it was correct, or fix the implementation in Django 2.2 to properly handle equality checks.\n- Review the `compiler.py` file, specifically the sections that handle the ordering of combined queries (look for `self.query.combinator` and `self.select`), to ensure that the ordering is preserved after a union operation.\n- If necessary, override the `order_by()` method on the `Listing` model's manager to handle the specific case of ordering after a union operation, ensuring that the correct SQL is generated for the combined queryset.\n- Test the changes using the provided `test-script.py` with `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=testunion.settings` to ensure that the issue is resolved and the correct ordering is applied to the union of querysets.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 405 - 1949](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L405-L1949)\n\n This snippet contains logic for handling ordering in SQL queries, which is relevant to the issue of incorrect ordering in union querysets. \n\n\n   - [Lines 459 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L459-L1596)\n\n This snippet deals with the ordering of expressions and may contain the logic that leads to the incorrect ordering when using order_by on a union queryset. \n\n\n   - [Lines 344 - 1464](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L344-L1464)\n\n This snippet includes logic for handling field resolution and ordering, which could be part of the problem when ordering by a field that is not the first in a union queryset.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1606 - 1606](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L1606-L1606)\n\n This snippet references the OrderBy class, which is likely involved in the ordering process that is causing the issue.",
