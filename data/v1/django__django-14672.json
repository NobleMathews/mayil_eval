This function should convert non-hashable types like lists into a hashable type, such as a tuple.\n- Modify the `__hash__` method of `ManyToManyRel` to use `make_hashable` on `self.through_fields` if it is a list.\n- Example implementation of `make_hashable` function:\n  ```python\n  def make_hashable(value):\n      if isinstance(value, list):\n          return tuple(value)\n      return value\n  ```\n- Example modification in `ManyToManyRel` class:\n  ```python\n  class ManyToManyRel:\n      # ... other methods and properties ...\n\n      def __hash__(self):\n          through_fields_hashable = make_hashable(self.through_fields) if isinstance(self.through_fields, list) else self.through_fields\n          self.identity = (self.model, through_fields_hashable, ...)\n          return hash(self.identity)\n  ```\n- Ensure that `limit_choices_to` is also hashable when used in contexts that require hashing.\n- Review the `__hash__` method in `reverse_related.py` to ensure it is consistent with the changes made to `ManyToManyRel`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 137 - 1619](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L137-L1619)\n\n This snippet directly references 'through_fields' and performs a check on its length and contents, which is related to the issue of making 'through_fields' hashable. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1529 - 1777](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1529-L1777)\n\n This snippet contains logic that checks the 'through_fields' attribute for errors, which is relevant to the issue since 'through_fields' needs to be made hashable. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1636 - 1689](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1636-L1689)\n\n This snippet includes error checks that involve 'through_fields', which is relevant to the issue of ensuring 'through_fields' is hashable. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1503 - 1777](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1503-L1777)\n\n This snippet checks for the presence of 'through_fields' in a self-referential context, which is relevant to the issue as it deals with the hashability of 'through_fields'. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1583 - 1777](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1583-L1777)\n\n This snippet checks for the presence of foreign keys in 'through_fields', which is relevant to the issue since the hashability of 'through_fields' is in question. \n\n\n   - [Lines 46 - 1976](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L46-L1976)\n\n This snippet defines the ManyToManyField, including the 'through_fields' parameter, which is relevant to the issue as it may need to be modified to ensure 'through_fields' is made hashable.",
