    "title": "Accessing response.content twice removes forgets read error",
    "body": "I had a hard debugging time today because an error in the response stream is only reported when accessing `response.content` for the first time.\r\n\r\nThis is especially irritating when running code in a debugger.\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\nIf accessing `response.content` the first time raises an exception I would expect that accessing `response.content` again would also raise an exception (ideally the same). \r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\nInstead after raising on the first get, getting `response.content` again returns an empty string.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nHere is a patch with a new test case for this: [error_replay_test.diff.gz](https://github.com/requests/requests/files/2838360/error_replay_test.diff.gz).\r\n\r\nBasically, it boils down to this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\n\r\nresponse = requests.post(\"http://connreset.biz/get/incomplete/chunked\", stream=True)\r\ntry:\r\n    response.content\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n    # Error handling code, may try something else or fall through\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ncontent = response.content  # empty string\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of my test case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pipenv run py.test tests/test_lowlevel.py -q --tb=short -k retain\r\nF                                                            [100%]\r\n============================= FAILURES =============================\r\n_______________ test_response_content_retains_error ________________\r\ntests/test_lowlevel.py:343: in test_response_content_retains_error\r\n    assert False, \"error response has content: {0!r}\".format(content)\r\nE   AssertionError: error response has content: ''\r\nE   assert False\r\n1 failed, 15 deselected in 0.60 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n\r\n    $ python -m requests.help\r\n\r\n*Edit*: Oops, I used `pipenv run python -m requests.help` which actually called into system python 2.7. Here comes the real data:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pipenv run python3 -m requests.help\r\n{\r\n  \"chardet\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"3.0.4\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"cryptography\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"idna\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.7\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"implementation\": {\r\n    \"name\": \"CPython\",\r\n    \"version\": \"3.6.8+\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"platform\": {\r\n    \"release\": \"4.15.0-43-generic\",\r\n    \"system\": \"Linux\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"pyOpenSSL\": {\r\n    \"openssl_version\": \"\",\r\n    \"version\": null\r\n  },\r\n  \"requests\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"2.21.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"system_ssl\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1000207f\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"urllib3\": {\r\n    \"version\": \"1.24\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"using_pyopenssl\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this!\r\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue is that after an exception is caught when accessing `response.content` for the first time, subsequent accesses to `response.content` return an empty string instead of re-raising the exception. To resolve this issue:\n\n- Modify the `Response.content` property in `requests/models.py` to track and re-raise the initial exception on subsequent accesses after the first exception is caught.\n- Implement a mechanism to store the exception when it first occurs and check for this stored exception in the `Response.content` property getter.\n\nHere is a possible solution:\n\n```python\nclass Response:\n    ...\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        ...\n        self._error = None  # Initialize a variable to store the exception\n        ...\n\n    @property\n    def content(self):\n        \"\"\"Content of the response, in bytes.\"\"\"\n        if self._content is False:\n            if self._content_consumed:\n                if self._error:  # Check if an error was previously caught\n                    raise self._error  # Re-raise the stored exception\n                else:\n                    raise RuntimeError(\"The content for this response was already consumed\")\n\n            if self.status_code == 0 or self.raw is None:\n                self._content = None\n            else:\n                try:\n                    self._content = b\"\".join(self.iter_content(CONTENT_CHUNK_SIZE)) or b\"\"\n                except Exception as e:  # Catch any exception that occurs\n                    self._error = e  # Store the exception\n                    raise  # Re-raise the current exception\n\n        self._content_consumed = True\n        return self._content\n    ...\n```\n\nThis modification ensures that if an exception occurs during the first access to `response.content`, it is stored in `self._error`. On subsequent accesses, the stored exception is re-raised, preserving the expected behavior.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.22/tree//requests)- [Lines 853 - 942](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.22/blob//requests/models.py#L853-L942)\n\n This snippet contains the 'content' property implementation in the Response object, which is directly related to the issue of accessing 'response.content' and the behavior after an exception is raised. \n\n\n   - [Lines 795 - 851](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.22/blob//requests/models.py#L795-L851)\n\n This snippet includes the 'iter_content' method which is called by the 'content' property.
