    "body": "Is there a reason why the `FeatureUnion` method signature `fit_transform` accepts `fit_args` but neither `fit` nor `transform` do? It seems to go against the pattern that `fit_transform()` is the same as calling `fit().transform()`?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1495f69242646d239d89a5713982946b8ffcf9d9/sklearn/pipeline.py#L895\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1495f69242646d239d89a5713982946b8ffcf9d9/sklearn/pipeline.py#L871\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/1495f69242646d239d89a5713982946b8ffcf9d9/sklearn/pipeline.py#L944\r\n\r\nI see there's been discussion on supporting  `fit_args` but it's not clear if this is resolved. My case is I'm trying to migrage code I wrote a while back where I used a Pipeline and each of my transformers adds columns to a dataframe, to a FeatureUnion where each transform only returns the new columns. One of my transforms takes a third data set in addition to X and y which is used as the transform. I guess as a workaround I'll make it a param of the transform rather than a fit_arg.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude41.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nThe `FeatureUnion` class in scikit-learn is designed to combine several transformer objects into a single transformer by concatenating their output. The issue raised in the ticket is about the inconsistency between the `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` methods of `FeatureUnion` with respect to accepting `fit_args`.\n\n- The `fit_transform` method of `FeatureUnion` is designed to accept `**fit_params` which allows passing additional fit parameters to each transformer within the union. This is evident from the `fit_transform` method signature in the `FeatureUnion` class:\n\n```python\ndef fit_transform(self, X, y=None, **fit_params):\n    ...\n```\n\n- However, the `fit` and `transform` methods do not accept `**fit_params`. Their signatures are as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fit(self, X, y=None, **fit_params):\n    ...\ndef transform(self, X):\n    ...\n```\n\nThe `fit` method does accept `**fit_params`, but the `transform` method does not. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior when users expect that calling `fit().transform()` is equivalent to `fit_transform()`.\n\nThe reason for this design choice is not explicitly stated in the scikit-learn documentation or codebase. It could be due to historical reasons or an oversight that has not been corrected. The discussion mentioned in the ticket might be related to ongoing or past discussions on scikit-learn's GitHub issues or pull requests regarding the handling of `fit_params`.\n\nAs a workaround, the ticket author suggests making the additional dataset a parameter of the transformer rather than a `fit_arg`. This is a valid approach to ensure that the transformer has access to all necessary data during the `transform` method call.\n\nIf the behavior of `FeatureUnion` is to be changed to make `fit`, `transform`, and `fit_transform` consistent with respect to `fit_params`, it would require changes to the scikit-learn codebase, specifically to the `transform` method of `FeatureUnion` to accept and handle `**fit_params`. This would likely be a breaking change and would need to be discussed and agreed upon by the scikit-learn development team.",
