    "title": "Diamond inheritance causes duplicated PK error when creating an object, if the primary key field has a default.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nHi, I'm not sure if this is a bug or an unsupported feature. But I looked into the django/db/models/base.py source code and now have a pretty good understanding of what is happening. \nMy business code uses a diamond shape inheritance to model different types of user posts: UserPost, ImagePost, VideoPost, and MixedContentPost. The inheritance goes like this: both ImagePost and VideoPost extend from UserPost, and the MixedContentPost inherits from ImagePost and VideoPost. All of them are concrete models\nI read the doc and expected it to work, similar to the example \nclass Piece(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Article(Piece):\n\tarticle_piece = models.OneToOneField(Piece, on_delete=models.CASCADE, parent_link=True)\n\t...\nclass Book(Piece):\n\tbook_piece = models.OneToOneField(Piece, on_delete=models.CASCADE, parent_link=True)\n\t...\nclass BookReview(Book, Article):\n\tpass\nHowever, I found out that the doc's example only works when these models use a primary key field that does not have a default. In my case, we are using a UUIDField as the primary key with a default of uuid4. Trying to create a BookReview in our case, causes a django.db.utils.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed error, because django tries to create the Piece object twice, with the same uuid.\nThe same behavior is found if I used a AutoField on Piece, with a custom default function, such as\nid = 99\ndef increment():\n\tglobal id\n\tid += 1\n\treturn id\nThis default function makes no sense in practice, but I just use it here to illustrate the root cause of the problem:\nThe _save_table method in db/models/base.py has a like this:\n\t\t# Skip an UPDATE when adding an instance and primary key has a default.\n\t\tif (\n\t\t\tnot raw\n\t\t\tand not force_insert\n\t\t\tand self._state.adding\n\t\t\tand meta.pk.default\n\t\t\tand meta.pk.default is not NOT_PROVIDED\n\t\t):\n\t\t\tforce_insert = True\nWhen a default is not present, which is the case of the documentation example, Django will first insert the first instance of the Piece object, and then for the second one, since force_insert is False, _save_table tries an update and goes through. Therefore there is not duplicate.\nHowever, if a default is present, then the second Piece becomes an insertion as well (because meta.pk.default and meta.pk.default is not NOT_PROVIDED, force_insert is True). This causes a duplication on the primary key.\nOn the other hand, _insert_parent does an in-order traversal calling _save_table on each node, so even in the no-default pk case, it is calling a redundant update on the root node after the insertion..\nSo which function is at fault? \nThe source code _save_table assumes that if you are calling it with a default pk then you can skip an update. This assumption looks weird to me: why only when there IS a default pk you can skip update? Why not just skip update as long as we know we are inserting? (via self._state.adding) Is it just to make it special so that AutoField works? If _save_table's responsibility is to try updating before inserting, except when the params force it to do an update or insert, then it shouldn't override that behavior by this self-assumeption within it.\nI think the solution is to simply move the check to save_base. And don't do this check in _save_parents.\nLike this:\n\tdef save_base(\n\t\tself,\n\t\traw=False,\n\t\tforce_insert=False,\n\t\tforce_update=False,\n\t\tusing=None,\n\t\tupdate_fields=None,\n\t):\n\t\t\"\"\"\n\t\tHandle the parts of saving which should be done only once per save,\n\t\tyet need to be done in raw saves, too. This includes some sanity\n\t\tchecks and signal sending.\n\t\tThe 'raw' argument is telling save_base not to save any parent\n\t\tmodels and not to do any changes to the values before save.

    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude15.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nBased on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the handling of primary keys in models with diamond-shaped inheritance when saving to the database. The `UNIQUE constraint failed` error suggests that there is an attempt to insert a record with a primary key that already exists in the database.\n\nTo address this issue, consider the following solution:\n\n- Ensure that the primary key field (UUIDField with default `uuid4`) is correctly generating unique values for each instance of the models involved in the diamond-shaped inheritance (`UserPost`, `ImagePost`, `VideoPost`, `MixedContentPost`).\n- In the `save_base` method, check if the primary key (`self.pk`) is already set before attempting to insert a new record. If the primary key is set (`self.pk is not None`), use `force_update=True` instead of `force_insert=True` to avoid attempting to insert a duplicate primary key.\n- In the `_save_table` method, ensure that the logic for handling the primary key respects the unique constraint by checking if the primary key value is already present in the database before attempting to save the model instance.\n- If using `bulk_create`, ensure that the `ignore_conflicts=True` parameter is set to avoid raising an `IntegrityError` when unique constraint violations occur. However, this should be used with caution as it may lead to data inconsistency if not handled properly.\n- If the issue persists, consider overriding the `save` method in the models to include additional logic to handle the unique constraints of the primary key field, especially in the context of diamond-shaped inheritance.\n\nRemember to test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the issue is resolved without introducing new bugs or data integrity issues.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1107 - 2551](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L1107-L2551)\n\n This snippet contains the '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' method which is part of the save process for models and may be relevant to the issue of handling primary keys with defaults during object creation. \n\n\n   - [Lines 957 - 1064](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L957-L1064)\n\n This snippet includes logic related to the '_do_insert' method which is involved in the insertion of new records into the database and could be relevant to the issue of handling primary keys with defaults.",
