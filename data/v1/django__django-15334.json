    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Asif Saifuddin Auvi)\n\t \nI was surprised when I found out that prefetch_related calls are ignored when using Queryset.iterator. I noticed in the docs here \u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#iterator that it is because the \"these two optimizations do not make sense together.\" That may have been true in the past, but it is definitely not the case now. The iterator allows chunking (by default 2000) and it would be very helpful to prefetch related for each chunk.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement support for `prefetch_related()` with `Queryset.iterator()`, you need to modify the `iterator` method in the `QuerySet` class to handle prefetching of related objects for each chunk of results. Here's a high-level overview of the steps to implement this feature:\n\n- Modify the `iterator` method in `django/db/models/query.py` to support prefetching.\n- Ensure that `chunk_size` is provided when `prefetch_related` is used.\n- Use the `prefetch_related_objects` function to prefetch the related objects for each chunk of results.\n\nHere's a rough implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models.query import prefetch_related_objects\nfrom itertools import islice\n\nclass QuerySet:\n    # ...\n\n    def _iterator(self, use_chunked_fetch, chunk_size):\n        # Existing iterable based on the current QuerySet\n        iterable = self._iterable_class(\n            self,\n            chunked_fetch=use_chunked_fetch,\n            chunk_size=chunk_size or 2000,\n        )\n        \n        # If prefetch_related_lookups are present and a chunk_size is provided,\n        # handle prefetching for each chunk.\n        if self._prefetch_related_lookups and chunk_size is not None:\n            iterator = iter(iterable)\n            while True:\n                # Fetch a chunk of results\n                results = list(islice(iterator, chunk_size))\n                if not results:\n                    break\n                \n                # Prefetch related objects for the chunk\n                prefetch_related_objects(results, *self._prefetch_related_lookups)\n                \n                # Yield the results with prefetched objects\n                yield from results\n        else:\n            # If no prefetch_related_lookups, yield from the iterable directly\n            yield from iterable\n\n    def iterator(self, chunk_size=None):\n        # ... existing code ...\n\n        # Call the modified _iterator method with chunked fetch and chunk size\n        return self._iterator(use_chunked_fetch, chunk_size)\n```\n\nThis implementation modifies the `_iterator` method to handle prefetching if `_prefetch_related_lookups` are present and a `chunk_size` is provided. It uses `islice` to get a chunk of results from the iterator and then calls `prefetch_related_objects` to prefetch the related objects for that chunk. After prefetching, it yields the results with the prefetched objects.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions and edge cases as needed, and ensure that the rest of the `QuerySet` class is compatible with these changes. Testing is crucial to ensure that the feature works as expected and does not introduce regressions.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 523 - 587](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L523-L587)\n\n This snippet contains the iterator method which is directly related to the issue, as it raises a ValueError when prefetch_related is used without providing a chunk_size. \n\n\n   - [Lines 454 - 521](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L454-L521)\n\n This snippet includes the _iterator method which is responsible for handling the iteration of QuerySet results and is relevant to the issue as it deals with prefetch_related_lookups and chunk_size. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2336 - 2387](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2336-L2387)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it shows the prefetch_one_level function which is part of the prefetching mechanism and may need to be considered when changing how prefetch_related works with Queryset.iterator(). \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 2518](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1-L2518)\n\n This snippet is relevant because it provides insight into the prefetch_related_objects helper function, which is involved in the prefetching process and may be affected by changes to prefetch_related with Queryset.iterator(). \n\n\n   - [Lines 2272 - 2334](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L2272-L2334)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it shows the process of preparing objects for prefetching and may need to be considered when addressing the issue with prefetch_related and Queryset.iterator(). \n\n\n   - [Lines 372 - 452](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L372-L452)\n\n This snippet is less directly related to the issue but shows the __iter__ method of QuerySet, which could provide context for how iteration is currently handled in Django.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [forms](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/forms)- [Lines 1405 - 1652](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/forms/models.py#L1405-L1652)\n\n This snippet from django/forms/models.py shows the ModelChoiceIterator class where it checks for prefetch_related_lookups before using iterator(), which is relevant to understanding how prefetch_related is currently handled in different parts of Django.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 155 - 199](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L155-L199)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it shows the get_prefetch_queryset method in related descriptors, which could be impacted by changes to how prefetch_related is handled with Queryset.iterator(). \n\n\n   - [Lines 705 - 749](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L705-L749)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it shows another instance of get_prefetch_queryset and the management of the reverse relation cache, which could be related to the issue of prefetch_related with Queryset.iterator().\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [contenttypes](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/contrib/contenttypes)- [Lines 177 - 683](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/contrib/contenttypes/fields.py#L177-L683)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it shows the get_prefetch_queryset method in the context of contenttypes fields, which may need to be reviewed if changes are made to prefetch_related with Queryset.iterator().",
