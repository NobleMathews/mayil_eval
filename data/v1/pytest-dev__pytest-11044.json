    "body": "We should issue a warning (or even an error?) if  `testpaths` does not match any files or folders.\r\n\r\nI think an error is reasonable, even if it might break some incorrectly-configured suite out there.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @nicoddemus in https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11006#issuecomment-1551342447_\r\n\r\nThis is not really a bug, but an intended (albeit questionable) behavior: \r\n\r\nThe values of `testpaths` are actually globs, so globbing for `tests` in the root yields nothing. Given it finds nothing, pytest will behave as if called from the command-line without any parameters, which makes it search recursively from the current directory looking for `python_files` to collect.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/739408b958f8e5a24de81e17e4cc2d4f34d93991/src/_pytest/config/__init__.py#L1382-L1384\r\n\r\nIf you create the `tests` directory, then pytest will correctly search in that directory only.\r\n\r\nI agree those 2 facts are surprising:\r\n\r\n1. The fact that `testpaths` is a glob. This is [documented](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#confval-testpaths) but easy to overlook, probably we should add a glob to the example there.\r\n2. pytest silently not finding anything, and then proceeding as usual.\r\n\r\nI don't think we can do anything more for 1, but for 2 seems like we should at least emit a warning if `testpaths` is defined but does not match anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \n",

    "mayil_response": "To address the issue described, follow these steps:\n\n- Update the `_pytest/config/__init__.py` file to include a check after the `testpaths` are parsed and before the collection starts.\n- Implement a function that checks if the glob patterns in `testpaths` yield any files or directories.\n- If the `testpaths` glob patterns yield no results, emit a warning to inform the user.\n- Update the documentation to include a glob example for `testpaths` and mention the new warning behavior.\n- Ensure that the default behavior of pytest (recursively searching for `python_files`) remains unchanged when `testpaths` is not specified or yields no results.\n\nHere is a hypothetical code snippet that could be added to `_pytest/config/__init__.py`:\n\n```python\ndef warn_if_testpaths_yield_no_results(testpaths, config):\n    if testpaths:\n        matched_files_folders = glob_testpaths(testpaths)\n        if not matched_files_folders:\n            config.issue_warning(PytestConfigWarning(\n                f\"The testpaths option in pytest.ini did not match any files: {testpaths}\"\n            ))\n\n# Call this function after parsing the testpaths and before starting the collection process\nwarn_if_testpaths_yield_no_results(parsed_testpaths, config)\n```\n\nRemember to import any necessary modules and classes, such as `PytestConfigWarning`, and to define the `glob_testpaths` function if it does not already exist.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [src](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.4/tree//src)- [Lines 1 -

It suggests updating the code to include a check for the `testpaths` glob patterns, implementing a function to verify if the patterns yield results, and emitting a warning if they do not. Additionally, the RESPONSE advises updating the documentation to reflect these changes and ensure users are aware of the new warning behavior. The RESPONSE also includes a hypothetical code snippet, which is directly relevant and could be used as a starting point for the actual implementation. The RESPONSE does not address the snippets provided at the end, which are not relevant to the issue, but this does not detract significantly from the overall utility of the RESPONSE.",
