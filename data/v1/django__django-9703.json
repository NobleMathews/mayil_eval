    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature that suggests commands for mistyped management commands in a Django project, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `ManagementUtility` class in `django/core/management/__init__.py` to include a method that suggests similar command names based on the user's input.\n- Use a string similarity algorithm like Levenshtein distance to find the closest matches to the mistyped command.\n- Override the `execute` method of the `ManagementUtility` class to catch `CommandError` exceptions when a command is not found and then call the suggestion method to display possible matches.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes:\n\n1. Add a new method to suggest commands:\n```python\nimport difflib\n\nclass ManagementUtility:\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    def suggest_commands(self, mistyped_command):\n        commands = get_commands().keys()\n        suggestions = difflib.get_close_matches(mistyped_command, commands)\n        return suggestions\n```\n\n2. Override the `execute` method to catch `CommandError` and suggest commands:\n```python\nclass ManagementUtility:\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    def execute(self):\n        try:\n            # ... existing code that executes the command ...\n        except CommandError as e:\n            if 'Unknown command' in str(e):\n                mistyped_command = e.args[1]  # Assuming the mistyped command is the second argument\n                suggestions = self.suggest_commands(mistyped_command)\n                if suggestions:\n                    sys.stderr.write('Did you mean one of these?\\n')\n                    for suggestion in suggestions:\n                        sys.stderr.write('    %s\\n' % suggestion)\n            raise\n```\n\n3. Ensure that the `CommandError` raised when a command is not found includes the mistyped command as an argument so it can be used for suggestions.\n\nIn the `BaseCommand` class or wherever the `CommandError` is raised for unknown commands, make sure to include the mistyped command:\n```python\n# Example of raising CommandError with the mistyped command\nraise CommandError('Unknown command: %r' % command_name, command_name)\n```\n\nThis is a simplified example, and you may need to adjust the code to fit the actual structure of the Django management command framework. The `difflib` module is part of the Python standard library and provides the `get_close_matches` function, which can be used to find similar strings based on the Levenshtein distance algorithm.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/tree//django/core/management)- [Lines 30 - 317](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/blob//django/core/management/__init__.py#L30-L317)\n\n This snippet contains the autocomplete function that is likely to be modified to suggest commands for mistyped commands. \n\n\n   - [Lines 315 - 351](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/blob//django/core/management/__init__.py#L315-L351)\n\n This snippet is part of the autocomplete logic and may need to be reviewed or modified to enhance the command suggestion feature. \n\n\n   - [Lines 197 - 197](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/blob//django/core/management/__init__.py#L197-L197)\n\n This snippet defines the ManagementUtility class which may be involved in handling the command invocation process. \n\n\n   - [Lines 278 - 278](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__2.1/blob//django/core/management/__init__.py#L278-L278)\n\n This snippet shows the definition of the autocomplete method, which is relevant to the issue as it may be the place where the enhancement is implemented.",
