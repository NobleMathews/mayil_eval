    "mayil_response": "- Ensure that the `canonical` method in `sympy/core/relational.py` is idempotent. This means that applying `canonical` multiple times should yield the same result.\n- Check the implementation of the `canonical` method to ensure that it produces a stable result regardless of how many times it is called.\n- If the `canonical` method is not idempotent, modify the implementation to return a consistent canonical form.\n- Since the issue is with the inequality `x**2 > -y/x`, ensure that the `canonical` method handles division and negation correctly and consistently.\n- Review the logic that handles the ordering and sign extraction in the `canonical` method to ensure that it does not produce different results on subsequent calls with the same input.\n- If the `canonical` method relies on any other methods (like `ordered`, `reversed`, `reversedsign`, etc.), ensure that these methods are also idempotent and do not introduce inconsistencies.\n- After making changes, test the `canonical` method with the expression `x**2 > -y/x` and other similar expressions to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 98 - 795](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/core/relational.py#L98-L795)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation of the 'canonical' method for relational objects, which is directly related to the issue reported. The issue states that calling 'canonical' twice does not yield the same result, which suggests a problem in this method. \n\n\n   - [Lines 297 - 310](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/core/relational.py#L297-L310)\n\n This snippet is part of the 'canonical' method's logic and shows the process of simplifying the relational expression before calling 'canonical' again. It may be relevant to understand how the initial expression is being transformed before the canonical method is applied. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 35](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/core/relational.py#L1-L35)\n\n This snippet defines a helper function '_canonical' that applies the 'canonical' method to all relational atoms within a condition. It may be relevant to understand how the canonical method is used in broader contexts within the codebase. \n\n\n   - [Lines 367 - 762](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/core/relational.py#L367-L762)\n\n This snippet shows the use of the 'canonical' method within a conditional check to see if the result of an operation is simplified enough. It may provide insight into how the canonical method affects the simplification process.",

Additionally, the RESPONSE suggests reviewing related logic and methods that could affect the idempotency of the `canonical` method, which is a comprehensive approach to debugging. The inclusion of specific code snippets to check is highly valuable and directly relevant to the issue at hand.
