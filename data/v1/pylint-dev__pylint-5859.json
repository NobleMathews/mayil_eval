    "mayil_response": "- Review the code responsible for handling the `--notes` option and ensure it correctly parses and recognizes note tags with punctuation, such as \"???\".\n- Modify the `register_note_tags` function to include punctuation in the regex pattern used for matching note tags if it is currently using a regex pattern that excludes punctuation.\n- If the `check_fixme_warning` function is responsible for generating W0511 warnings, ensure that it does not discard or misinterpret note tags with punctuation.\n- If the issue is related to command-line argument parsing, check the argument parser configuration to ensure that it correctly handles the `--notes` option with punctuation-inclusive tags.\n- If the issue persists, consider debugging with a breakpoint or print statements in the relevant functions to trace how the \"???\" note tag is processed and why it is not triggering a warning.\n- Ensure that the fix is compatible with the specified versions of pylint (2.12.2), astroid (2.9.0), and Python (3.10.2).\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/checkers) \u2192 [refactoring](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/checkers/refactoring)- [Lines 1 - 84](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/checkers/refactoring/not_checker.py#L1-L84)\n\n This snippet is from a checker file and might contain logic related to how pylint handles note tags and warnings.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/checkers)- [Lines 3 - 902](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/checkers/typecheck.py#L3-L902)\n\n This snippet is from a configuration-related file and could contain settings that affect the handling of note tags.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/checkers) \u2192 [refactoring](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/checkers/refactoring)- [Lines 355 - 2175](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/checkers/refactoring/refactoring_checker.py#L355-L2175)\n\n This snippet is from a refactoring checker file and might contain logic related to how pylint handles note tags and warnings.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/tree//pylint/checkers)- [Lines 431 - 719](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.13/blob//pylint/checkers/stdlib.py#L431-L719)\n\n This snippet is from a standard library checker file and might contain logic related to how pylint handles note tags and warnings.",
