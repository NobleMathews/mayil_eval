    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Tim Graham)\n\t \nWrote a failing test for tests/modeladmin/tests.py to demonstrate - same test/code passes on 1.8\n@isolate_apps('modeladmin')\ndef test_lookup_allowed_foreign_primary(self):\n\tclass Country(models.Model):\n\t\tname = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\tclass Place(models.Model):\n\t\tcountry = models.ForeignKey(Country, models.CASCADE)\n\tclass Restaurant(models.Model):\n\t\tplace = models.OneToOneField(Place, models.CASCADE, primary_key=True)\n\tclass Waiter(models.Model):\n\t\trestaurant = models.ForeignKey(Restaurant, models.CASCADE)\n\tclass WaiterAdmin(ModelAdmin):\n\t\tlist_filter = [\n\t\t\t'restaurant__place__country',\n\t\t]\n\tma = WaiterAdmin(Waiter, self.site)\n\tself.assertIs(ma.lookup_allowed('restaurant__place__country', 'test_value'), True)\nI think this is caused by the admin thinking that having a foreign key field as a primary key is the same as concrete inheritance. So when you try and check lookups for restaurant__place__country it thinks 'place' is the concrete parent of 'restaurant' and shortcuts it to restaurant__country which isn't in 'list_filter'. And you can't add restaurant__country to list_filter because country isn't actually on restaurant.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- The issue is likely related to the `lookup_allowed` method in `ModelAdmin` not handling the case where a foreign key is used as a primary key.\n- The `lookup_allowed` method should be modified to correctly handle lookups that span relations involving foreign keys used as primary keys.\n- The following changes should be made to the `lookup_allowed` method in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`:\n\n```python\ndef lookup_allowed(self, lookup, value, request=None):\n    # ... [existing code before the loop] ...\n\n    for part in lookup.split(LOOKUP_SEP):\n        try:\n            field = model._meta.get_field(part)\n        except FieldDoesNotExist:\n            # ... [existing code in exception handling] ...\n        \n        # Check if the field is a primary key and a relation at the same time\n        if field.primary_key and hasattr(field, 'remote_field'):\n            relation_parts.append(part)\n        # ... [existing code after the primary key check] ...\n\n    # ... [existing code after the loop] ...\n```\n\n- Ensure that the `relation_parts` list is correctly populated with parts of the lookup that correspond to foreign keys used as primary keys.\n- This change should allow the `lookup_allowed` method to correctly identify and permit lookups that involve foreign keys as primary keys, resolving the `DisallowedModelAdminLookup` error.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [admin](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib/admin)- [Lines 448 - 2516](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/contrib/admin/options.py#L448-L2516)\n\n This code snippet contains the implementation of 'lookup_allowed' which is directly related to the issue described. The logic for determining if a lookup is allowed or not is present here, and the issue seems to be with the handling of foreign keys as primary keys within this method. \n\n\n   - [Lines 515 - 2516](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/contrib/admin/options.py#L515-L2516)\n\n This snippet includes the 'to_field_allowed' method, which is related to field lookups in the admin. While not directly mentioned in the issue, it could be relevant for understanding the overall handling of field lookups in the admin interface.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [admin](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib/admin) \u2192 [views](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib/admin/views)- [Lines 176 - 234](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/contrib/admin/views/main.py#L176-L234)\n\n This snippet is relevant because it shows the usage of 'lookup_allowed' within the context of the admin views. It demonstrates how the method is called and how the 'DisallowedModelAdminLookup' exception is raised, which is the behavior reported in the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [admin](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib/admin)- [Lines 1 - 25](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/contrib/admin/exceptions.py#L1-L25)\n\n This snippet defines the 'DisallowedModelAdminLookup' exception that is mentioned in the issue description. Understanding this exception is necessary for resolving the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [admin](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/contrib/admin)- [Lines 1 - 713](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/contrib/admin/filters.py#L1-L713)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it pertains to the 'list_filter' functionality in the Django admin, which is mentioned in the issue description. The issue may be related to how list filters are processed and validated.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 1529 - 1777](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1529-L1777)\n\n This snippet from 'related.py' is relevant because it deals with foreign key relationships, which are central to the issue. It may contain logic that affects how foreign keys are interpreted when used as primary keys.",
