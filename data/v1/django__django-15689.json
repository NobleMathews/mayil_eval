    "title": "APPEND_SLASH adds significant latency to all requests not ending in / (even if successful)",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nOriginally, APPEND_SLASH worked by looking for 404 responses and replacing them with redirects, so as not to unnecessarily impact the performance of successful responses. However, commit 9390da7fb6e251eaa9a785692f987296cb14523f in 1.9.5/1.10 changed this to check should_redirect_with_slash() on every request, resulting in a moderately expensive extra urlconf lookup for every request not ending with /, whether or not it succeeds as written.\nThis performance impact was not considered in the commit message or the corresponding ticket #26293, so I assume it was an oversight. That ticket asserted \u201cThis doesn't really make sense, since the two settings are not interdependent\u201d, which is incorrect\u2014performance was the reason for the interdependence.\nThe overhead was found to be significant enough in Zulip to merit \u200bsubclassing CommonMiddleware to skip it in certain conditions.\nHere\u2019s a \u200bminimal test project with an exaggerated number of routes so the overhead can be easily observed.\n$ ./manage.py runserver\n$ wrk http://127.0.0.1:8000/url9999\nRunning 10s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8000/url9999\n 2 threads and 10 connections\n Thread Stats Avg\t Stdev\t Max +/- Stdev\n\tLatency 232.40ms 73.85ms 570.86ms 69.16%\n\tReq/Sec\t21.70\t 9.47\t40.00\t 63.35%\n 426 requests in 10.01s, 64.90KB read\nRequests/sec:\t 42.56\nTransfer/sec:\t 6.48KB\n$ sed -i 's/# APPEND_SLASH = False/APPEND_SLASH = False/' slash_test_settings.py\n$ wrk http://127.0.0.1:8000/url9999\nRunning 10s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8000/url9999\n 2 threads and 10 connections\n Thread Stats Avg\t Stdev\t Max +/- Stdev\n\tLatency 139.80ms 52.07ms 352.19ms 69.09%\n\tReq/Sec\t36.46\t 12.23\t60.00\t 58.12%\n 714 requests in 10.01s, 108.79KB read\nRequests/sec:\t 71.32\nTransfer/sec:\t 10.87KB\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Review the `CommonMiddleware` implementation in `django/middleware/common.py` to ensure that the `should_redirect_with_slash` method is not causing unnecessary performance overhead when `APPEND_SLASH` is enabled.\n- Optimize the `should_redirect_with_slash` method to reduce the number of URL resolver calls, which can be expensive. Consider caching the results of `is_valid_path` checks.\n- If the performance issue persists, consider subclassing `CommonMiddleware` and overriding the `should_redirect_with_slash` method to introduce a more efficient check or to bypass the check under certain conditions.\n- Test the changes using the provided minimal test project and the `wrk` tool to benchmark the performance with `APPEND_SLASH` enabled and disabled.\n- If the issue is specific to a certain Django version as mentioned (1.9.5/1.10), ensure compatibility with those versions when making changes.\n- If necessary, apply the `no_append_slash` decorator from `django/views/decorators/common.py` to specific views that do not require a trailing slash, to bypass the `APPEND_SLASH` behavior for those views.\n- Ensure that any changes do not affect the expected behavior of the `CommonMiddleware` when handling 404 responses and URL rewriting based on the `APPEND_SLASH` setting.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [middleware](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/middleware)- [Lines 76 - 143](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/middleware/common.py#L76-L143)\n\n This snippet contains the 'process_response' method which is directly related to the issue as it describes the behavior when a 404 status code is encountered and how it decides to append a slash and redirect. \n\n\n   - [Lines 14 - 74](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/middleware/common.py#L14-L74)\n\n This snippet includes the 'should_redirect_with_slash' method which is a key part of the issue, as it determines whether a slash should be appended to the request path, potentially causing the performance overhead.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [views](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/views) \u2192 [decorators](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/views/decorators)- [Lines 1 - 27](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/views/decorators/common.py#L1-L27)\n\n This snippet defines a decorator that can be used to mark views as excluded from the APPEND_SLASH redirection, which is relevant to the issue as it offers a way to bypass the problematic behavior.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [admin](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/contrib/admin)- [Lines 445 - 573](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/contrib/admin/sites.py#L445-L573)\n\n This snippet shows the use of the 'no_append_slash' decorator in the context of the Django admin site, which is relevant as it demonstrates how the decorator from snippet #3 is applied in practice.",

It suggests reviewing and optimizing the `should_redirect_with_slash` method, which is directly related to the problem. The advice to consider caching the results of `is_valid_path` checks is particularly valuable as it could significantly reduce the number of expensive URL resolver calls. The RESPONSE also recommends subclassing `CommonMiddleware` if necessary, which aligns with the workaround mentioned in the PROMPT. Additionally, it advises testing changes with the provided minimal test project and using the `wrk` tool for benchmarking, which is a practical approach to validate the effectiveness of the changes. The RESPONSE also considers version compatibility and provides a fallback solution using the `no_append_slash` decorator for specific views. Lastly, it includes relevant code snippets for review, which adds to the utility of the RESPONSE.",
