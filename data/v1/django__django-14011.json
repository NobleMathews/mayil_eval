    "title": "LiveServerTestCase's ThreadedWSGIServer doesn't close database connections after each thread",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nIn Django 2.2.17, I'm seeing the reappearance of #22414 after it was fixed in 1.11. #22414 is the issue where the following error will occur at the conclusion of a test run when destroy_test_db() is called:\nOperationalError: database \"test_myapp\" is being accessed by other users\nThis error happens when not all of the database connections are closed. In my case today, I'm seeing this when running a single test that is a LiveServerTestCase. I see it in approximately half of my test runs, so it's not wholly deterministic (it's a race condition).\nThere weren't a whole lot of changes in the LiveServerTestCase-related code between 1.11 and 2.2, so I looked at them individually.\nIssue #20238 added threading support to LiveServerTestCase. One of the changes it made \u200bwas changing LiveServerThread to use ThreadedWSGIServer instead of WSGIServer. LiveServerThread is used by LiveServerTestCase.\nWhen I tried modifying LiveServerThread to use the old WSGIServer, I could no longer reproduce the above error. My changes were as follows:\nclass NonThreadedLiveServerThread(LiveServerThread):\n\tdef _create_server(self):\n\t\treturn WSGIServer((self.host, self.port), QuietWSGIRequestHandler, allow_reuse_address=False)\nclass MyTest(LiveServerTestCase):\n\tserver_thread_class = NonThreadedLiveServerThread\nThe CPython docs \u200bdescribe ThreadingMixIn as defining an attribute \"which indicates whether or not the server should wait for thread termination.\"\nConsistent with what I described above, Aymeric said the following on ticket #20238, seeming to foreshadow issues like this one:\nmore threading will certainly create more race conditions on shutdown, especially when it comes to the database connections \u2014 it's taken months to eliminate most from LiveServerTestCase, and I'm sure there are still some left,\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `LiveServerTestCase` not properly closing database connections when using `ThreadedWSGIServer`, leading to an `OperationalError` due to a race condition. Here is a solution to address the issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `ThreadedWSGIServer` class in `django/core/servers/basehttp.py` properly closes database connections after handling each request. Modify the `close_request` method to call `self._close_connections()` before calling `super().close_request(request)`.\n- In the `LiveServerTestCase` teardown process, add a step to explicitly close all database connections before attempting to destroy the test database. This can be done by calling `connections.close_all()` from `django.db` before calling `destroy_test_db()`.\n- If the `ThreadingMixIn` attribute for server thread termination is not properly set, ensure that `daemon_threads` is set to `True` in the `ThreadedWSGIServer` class to make sure that threads terminate when the main thread does.\n- If the issue persists, consider using the `NonThreadedLiveServerThread` as a workaround by setting `server_thread_class` to `NonThreadedLiveServerThread` in your `LiveServerTestCase` subclass, as shown in the provided `MyTest` class example. This will use a non-threaded server which may avoid the race condition.\n- Review any changes made in issue #20238 that might have introduced this regression and ensure that the server shutdown process waits for all threads to finish their work before proceeding with the database destruction.\n\nMake sure to test these changes thoroughly, as concurrency issues can be subtle and environment-specific.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core) \u2192 [servers](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core/servers)- [Lines 86 - 111](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/core/servers/basehttp.py#L86-L111)\n\n This snippet defines the ThreadedWSGIServer class, which is central to the issue as the error occurs when using ThreadedWSGIServer instead of WSGIServer. It includes the process_request_thread and close_request methods, which are likely places to look for ensuring database connections are properly closed.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [backends](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/backends) \u2192 [base](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/backends/base)- [Lines 587 - 663](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/backends/base/base.py#L587-L663)\n\n This snippet contains the close_if_unusable_or_obsolete method, which is relevant to the issue as it deals with closing database connections when they are no longer usable or have outlived their maximum age. This could be part of the solution to ensure connections are closed properly. \n\n\n   - [Lines 524 - 605](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/backends/base/base.py#L524-L605)\n\n This snippet includes the is_usable method, which is used to test if the database connection is usable. It may be relevant to the issue as it could be part of the mechanism to determine when to close a database connection.",

Modify the `close_request` method to call `self._close_connections()` before calling `super().close_request(request)`.\n- In the `LiveServerTestCase` teardown process, add a step to explicitly close all database connections before attempting to destroy the test database. This can be done by calling `connections.close_all()` from `django.db` before calling `destroy_test_db()`.\n- If the `ThreadingMixIn` attribute for server thread termination is not properly set, ensure that `daemon_threads` is set to `True` in the `ThreadedWSGIServer` class to make sure that threads terminate when the main thread does.\n- If the issue persists, consider using the `NonThreadedLiveServerThread` as a workaround by setting `server_thread_class` to `NonThreadedLiveServerThread` in your `LiveServerTestCase` subclass, as shown in the provided `MyTest` class example. This will use a non-threaded server which may avoid the race condition.\n- Review any changes made in issue #20238 that might have introduced this regression and ensure that the server shutdown process waits for all threads to finish their work before proceeding with the database destruction.\n\nMake sure to test these changes thoroughly, as concurrency issues can be subtle and environment-specific.",
