    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of creating geometry objects from an equation, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Define a method `object_from_equation` in both `line.py` and `circle.py` that takes an equation string as input and returns an instance of the respective geometry object.\n- For the `Line` class, parse the equation to extract the coefficients and create a `Line` object using the `linear_coeffs` function from `sympy.solvers.solveset`.\n- For the `Circle` class, parse the equation to extract the center and radius and create a `Circle` object.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the implementation:\n\nIn `line.py`:\n```python\nfrom sympy.parsing.sympy_parser import parse_expr\n\nclass Line(GeometryEntity):\n    # ... existing methods ...\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def object_from_equation(equation_str, x='x', y='y'):\n        equation = parse_expr(equation_str)\n        a, b, c = linear_coeffs(equation, x, y)\n        # Assuming the equation is in the form ax + by + c = 0\n        return Line(Point(-c/a, 0), slope=-a/b)\n```\n\nIn `circle.py`:\n```python\nfrom sympy.parsing.sympy_parser import parse_expr\nfrom sympy.solvers import solve\n\nclass Circle(Ellipse):\n    # ... existing methods ...\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def object_from_equation(equation_str, x='x', y='y'):\n        equation = parse_expr(equation_str)\n        # Assuming the equation is in the form (x - h)**2 + (y - k)**2 = r**2\n        h, k, r = solve(equation, (x, y))\n        return Circle(Point(h, k), r)\n```\n\nNote that the above code assumes that the equations are in a specific form. You may need to add additional parsing logic to handle different forms of equations for lines and circles. The `parse_expr` function from `sympy.parsing.sympy_parser` can be used to convert the equation string into a SymPy expression.\n\nRemember to handle exceptions and edge cases, such as when the equation does not represent a line or circle, or when the equation is not in an expected format.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy) \u2192 [geometry](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy/geometry)- [Lines 1483 - 1765](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/geometry/ellipse.py#L1483-L1765)\n\n This snippet contains the Circle class with its constructor that can be modified to accept an equation as input for creating a Circle object. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1620 - 1721](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/geometry/ellipse.py#L1620-L1721)\n\n This snippet contains the 'equation' method of the Circle class which may be relevant for understanding how equations are currently handled and could be useful for implementing the new feature.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy) \u2192 [geometry](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/tree//sympy/geometry)- [Lines 1 - 41](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.4/blob//sympy/geometry/line.py#L1-L41)\n\n This snippet contains the import section of the 'line.py' file which may need to be modified to include additional functions or classes necessary for implementing the conversion from an equation to a Line object.",
