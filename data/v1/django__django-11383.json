    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided issue summary and code snippets, the solution to the issue where a ForeignKey (FK) relation is saved with a NULL value despite setting a parent object on a child object and saving both should involve ensuring that the parent's primary key (PK) is properly assigned to the child before saving the child object. Here's a concise solution:\n\n- Ensure that the parent object has a PK before assigning it to the child. If the parent object is new and has not been saved yet, it won't have a PK, which can lead to the FK on the child being set to NULL.\n- Modify the `Child` model's `save` method to check if the parent object has a PK. If not, save the parent object first before saving the child.\n- In the `Child` model's `save` method, after saving the parent, set the FK field on the child to the parent's PK explicitly.\n\nHere's a code snippet that demonstrates the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    # other fields and methods for Child\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.parent_id is None and self.parent.pk is not None:\n            self.parent_id = self.parent.pk\n        elif self.parent_id is None:\n            self.parent.save()\n            self.parent_id = self.parent.pk\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the parent is saved and has a PK before the child is saved, preventing the FK from being saved as NULL.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1107 - 2551](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L1107-L2551)\n\n This snippet contains logic for preparing related fields for save, which is directly related to the issue of the ForeignKey relation being saved with a NULL value. It includes checks and raises a ValueError if a related object is unsaved, which might be part of the problem or the solution. \n\n\n   - [Lines 927 - 972](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L927-L972)\n\n This snippet contains logic for saving parent objects, which is relevant to the issue as it might affect the state of the parent_id when the child object is saved.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [forms](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/forms)- [Lines 1080 - 1150](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/forms/models.py#L1080-L1150)\n\n This snippet is from the form handling code that deals with child objects related to a parent, which is relevant to the issue as it involves saving child objects and might affect how the parent_id is set or not set.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 1 - 316](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py#L1-L316)\n\n This snippet deals with setting the related instance through the forward relation, which is relevant to the issue as it involves the assignment of parent to child objects and might be part of the problem when saving the child object.",

Here's a concise solution:\n\n- Ensure that the parent object has a PK before assigning it to the child. If the parent object is new and has not been saved yet, it won't have a PK, which can lead to the FK on the child being set to NULL.\n- Modify the `Child` model's `save` method to check if the parent object has a PK. If not, save the parent object first before saving the child.\n- In the `Child` model's `save` method, after saving the parent, set the FK field on the child to the parent's PK explicitly.\n\nHere's a code snippet that demonstrates the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    # other fields and methods for Child\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.parent_id is None and self.parent.pk is not None:\n            self.parent_id = self.parent.pk\n        elif self.parent_id is None:\n            self.parent.save()\n            self.parent_id = self.parent.pk\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the parent is saved and has a PK before the child is saved, preventing the FK from being saved as NULL.",

        "result": "Based on the provided issue summary and code snippets, the solution to the issue where a ForeignKey (FK) relation is saved with a NULL value despite setting a parent object on a child object and saving both should involve ensuring that the parent's primary key (PK) is properly assigned to the child before saving the child object. Here's a concise solution:\n\n- Ensure that the parent object has a PK before assigning it to the child. If the parent object is new and has not been saved yet, it won't have a PK, which can lead to the FK on the child being set to NULL.\n- Modify the `Child` model's `save` method to check if the parent object has a PK. If not, save the parent object first before saving the child.\n- In the `Child` model's `save` method, after saving the parent, set the FK field on the child to the parent's PK explicitly.\n\nHere's a code snippet that demonstrates the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    # other fields and methods for Child\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if self.parent_id is None and self.parent.pk is not None:\n            self.parent_id = self.parent.pk\n        elif self.parent_id is None:\n            self.parent.save()\n            self.parent_id = self.parent.pk\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the parent is saved and has a PK before the child is saved, preventing the FK from being saved as NULL.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1107 - 2551](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L1107-L2551)\n\n This snippet contains logic for preparing related fields for save, which is directly related to the issue of the ForeignKey relation being saved with a NULL value.
