    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the `sqlmigrate` command not being able to uniquely identify a migration when provided with a prefix that matches more than one migration or when the migration name provided does not exist. To resolve the issue:\n\n- Modify the `sqlmigrate` command to handle squashed migrations correctly by ensuring that it can uniquely identify squashed migrations and their original migrations.\n- Update the `MigrationLoader.get_migration_by_prefix` method in `django/db/migrations/loader.py` to handle cases where a squashed migration is involved.\n- Ensure that the `sqlmigrate` command provides a clear and informative error message when a specific migration cannot be found or when multiple migrations match a given prefix.\n- Implement a check in the `sqlmigrate` command to verify if a migration name provided is part of a squashed migration and, if so, to use the squashed migration's name instead.\n- In the `handle` method of the `sqlmigrate` command in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, add logic to handle the case where the target migration is part of a squashed migration by using the squashed migration's name or the last replacement migration's name if the squashed migration is partially applied.\n- If the `KeyError` is due to a missing migration that is expected to be there, investigate the migration history and the state of the migrations in the database to ensure consistency and correct any issues with missing or misnamed migrations.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 40 - 83](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py#L40-L83)\n\n This snippet from 'sqlmigrate.py' contains the logic for handling migration names and is directly related to the issue where 'sqlmigrate' fails to handle squashed migrations properly.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 85 - 305](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/loader.py#L85-L305)\n\n This snippet from 'loader.py' includes logic for handling missing nodes in the migration graph, which could be relevant when dealing with squashed migrations that are not being recognized correctly.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 154 - 189](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/migrate.py#L154-L189)\n\n This snippet from 'migrate.py' shows how the migration command handles migration names and targets, which could be relevant to the issue of 'sqlmigrate' not recognizing squashed migrations.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 255 - 267](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py#L255-L267)\n\n This snippet from 'squashmigrations.py' includes error handling for ambiguous migration names, which is part of the issue described.",
