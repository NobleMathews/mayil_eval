    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Jonny Fuller)\n\t \nHi friends,\nDuring testing I discovered a strange bug when using a query expression for ordering during multi-table inheritance. You can find the full write up as well as reproducible test repository \u200bhttps://github.com/JonnyWaffles/djangoordermetabug. The bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir. The linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious, but what I don't understand is why it only fails during test db setup, not during repl or script use. I wish I could help more and come up with a real solution. Hopefully, this is enough for someone wiser to find the culprit.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the handling of `OrderBy` objects during test database setup in a Django project with multi-table inheritance. The bug occurs because the field is an `OrderBy` object, not a string, and it fails during test db setup.\n\nTo address the issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `Meta.ordering` in the model definitions is using strings or expressions that are compatible with the test database setup. If `OrderBy` objects are used directly in `Meta.ordering`, replace them with strings representing the field names or with expressions that generate the correct SQL during test setup.\n- In the `get_order_dir` function, add a check to handle `OrderBy` objects correctly. If an `OrderBy` object is passed, extract the field name and direction from the object before proceeding.\n- In the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, where the ordering is processed, ensure that `OrderBy` objects are correctly handled when building the SQL for the test database. This might involve modifying the `for expr, is_ref in self._order_by_pairs():` loop to correctly handle `OrderBy` objects.\n- Review the test database setup code to ensure that it can handle `OrderBy` objects or convert them to a compatible format before the SQL is executed.\n\nSince the stack trace and test repository are not provided, these are general suggestions based on the information available. Specific changes would require analyzing the stack trace and the test repository to pinpoint the exact location and cause of the issue.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 459 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L459-L1596)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' contains the logic for ordering by expressions, which is likely where the issue with OrderBy objects not being handled correctly during test db setup arises. \n\n\n   - [Lines 405 - 1949](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L405-L1949)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' shows how OrderBy objects are created and used, which could be relevant to understanding how the ordering expressions are being handled. \n\n\n   - [Lines 344 - 1464](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L344-L1464)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' includes logic for resolving expressions and handling OrderBy objects, which could be directly related to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 317 - 341](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L317-L341)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/sql/compiler.py' shows how ordering is determined from various sources, including Meta.ordering, which is mentioned in the issue description.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [postgres](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/contrib/postgres) \u2192 [aggregates](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/contrib/postgres/aggregates)- [Lines 1 - 29](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/contrib/postgres/aggregates/mixins.py#L1-L29)\n\n This snippet from 'django/contrib/postgres/aggregates/mixins.py' shows the initialization and resolution of OrderByList, which might be relevant if the issue is related to the way ordering is being set up in aggregates.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1607 - 1607](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L1607-L1607)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/expressions.py' defines the OrderBy class, which is central to the issue as it is not being recognized as a string during get_order_dir. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1606 - 1606](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L1606-L1606)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/models/expressions.py' shows the deconstructible decorator for the OrderBy class, which might be relevant for understanding serialization/deserialization of OrderBy objects.",

If `OrderBy` objects are used directly in `Meta.ordering`, replace them with strings representing the field names or with expressions that generate the correct SQL during test setup.\n- In the `get_order_dir` function, add a check to handle `OrderBy` objects correctly. If an `OrderBy` object is passed, extract the field name and direction from the object before proceeding.\n- In the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file, where the ordering is processed, ensure that `OrderBy` objects are correctly handled when building the SQL for the test database. This might involve modifying the `for expr, is_ref in self._order_by_pairs():` loop to correctly handle `OrderBy` objects.\n- Review the test database setup code to ensure that it can handle `OrderBy` objects or convert them to a compatible format before the SQL is executed.\n\nSince the stack trace and test repository are not provided, these are general suggestions based on the information available.
