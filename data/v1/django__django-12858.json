    "mayil_response": "- Ensure that the `Product` model's `parent` field has the necessary lookups and transforms to support the `isnull` lookup in the `ordering` attribute of the `Stock` model's Meta class.\n- Verify that the `ForeignKey` relationship from `Product` to itself (`'self'`) is correctly defined and that the `null=True` attribute is set, allowing the `isnull` lookup to be valid.\n- If the `isnull` lookup is valid for the `parent` field in queries, but not in the `ordering` attribute, consider overriding the `get_ordering` method in the `Stock` model's manager to handle the ordering manually.\n- If the issue persists, check for any recent changes in Django's handling of the `ordering` attribute that might affect the use of lookups like `isnull`, especially if the issue is related to Django ticket `#29408`.\n- As a last resort, remove the problematic `ordering` attribute from the `Stock` model's Meta class and handle ordering explicitly in the querysets where it is needed.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 2218 - 2553](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L2218-L2553)\n\n This snippet contains the error message for 'models.E015' which is directly related to the issue reported.
