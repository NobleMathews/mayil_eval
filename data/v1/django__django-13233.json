    "title": "The `model` attribute of image fields doesn't point to concrete model.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nIn Django 3.1 and before, one could use the model attribute of image fields to find the concrete model the image field belongs to.\nThis isn't possible in 3.2 anymore, and I bisected the change to the fix of #31701.\nI found this while investigating a CI failure of django-imagefield \u200bhttps://travis-ci.org/github/matthiask/django-imagefield/jobs/710794644\nI'm not sure whether this is a bug or whether it is an intentional change. If it is the later, is there an alternative to find the concrete model an image field belongs to? I'm classifying this as a bug because the change made model and field introspection harder than it was before. Also, since behavior changed #31701 may possibly not be classified as a cleanup/optimization anymore...\n",

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",
