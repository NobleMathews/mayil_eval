    "mayil_response": "- Modify the `Piecewise` constructor in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` to automatically simplify redundant nested `Piecewise` expressions during instantiation.\n- Update the `doit` method of the `Sum` class in `sympy/concrete/summations.py` to handle infinite series and avoid creating nested `Piecewise` expressions when evaluating sums.\n- Ensure that the `doit` method of `Piecewise` in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` simplifies the expression correctly without the need for an explicit call to `piecewise_fold`.\n- Implement logic in the `Piecewise` constructor to recognize and eliminate redundant conditions, such as merging overlapping intervals and simplifying conditions that are always `True` or `False`.\n- In `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, ensure that `simplify` function calls `piecewise_fold` and `piecewise_simplify` appropriately to avoid redundant nested `Piecewise` expressions after simplification.\n- Add tests to verify that the `Piecewise` constructor, `doit` methods for `Piecewise` and `Sum`, and the `simplify` function behave as expected with the changes.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [functions](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/functions) \u2192 [elementary](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/functions/elementary)- [Lines 137 - 1123](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py#L137-L1123)\n\n This snippet contains logic for folding Piecewise expressions when the expression is an Add or Mul and is commutative, which is relevant to the issue of simplifying Piecewise expressions to avoid unnecessary growth. \n\n\n   - [Lines 16 - 1054](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py#L16-L1054)\n\n This snippet defines the piecewise_fold function, which is mentioned in the issue as a potential solution to the problem of Piecewise expression growth. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1191 - 1257](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py#L1191-L1257)\n\n The piecewise_simplify function is relevant as it attempts to simplify Piecewise expressions, which could be part of the solution to the reported issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 16 - 1028](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py#L16-L1028)\n\n This snippet defines the Piecewise class and its instantiation, which is central to the issue since the problem occurs during the instantiation of Piecewise objects.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [simplify](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/simplify)- [Lines 619 - 698](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/simplify/simplify.py#L619-L698)\n\n This snippet from the simplify module deals with Piecewise expressions to avoid recursive growth, which is directly related to the issue described.",

            "criteria": "The RESPONSE provides a series of actionable steps that are relevant to the issue described in the PROMPT. It suggests modifications to the Piecewise constructor, the doit method of the Sum class, and the doit method of Piecewise to prevent unnecessary growth of Piecewise expressions. It also recommends implementing logic to recognize and eliminate redundant conditions and to ensure that the simplify function calls piecewise_fold and piecewise_simplify appropriately. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a call to add tests to verify the changes, which is a good practice in software development. The code snippets provided are relevant and could be useful for someone looking to address the issue.",
            "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE directly addresses the problem of redundant nested Piecewise expressions and provides specific locations in the codebase where changes could be made. It also aligns with the context of the PROMPT, which is about simplifying Piecewise expressions and avoiding unnecessary complexity when using the doit method. The RESPONSE is comprehensive and covers multiple aspects of the problem, including the constructor, doit methods, and simplification functions. The inclusion of code snippets is helpful for guiding the developer to the relevant parts of the code.",
