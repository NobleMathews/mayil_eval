A round is a single\n        imputation of each feature with missing values. The stopping criterion\n        is met once `max(abs(X_t - X_{t-1}))/max(abs(X[known_vals])) < tol`,\n        where `X_t` is `X` at iteration `t`. Note that early stopping is only\n        applied if `sample_posterior=False`.\n\n    tol : float, default=1e-3\n        Tolerance of the stopping condition.\n\n    n_nearest_features : int, default=None\n        Number of other features to use to estimate the missing values of\n        each feature column. Nearness between features is measured using\n        the absolute correlation coefficient between each feature pair (after\n        initial imputation). To ensure coverage of features throughout the\n        imputation process, the neighbor features are not necessarily nearest,\n        but are drawn with probability proportional to correlation for each\n        imputed target feature. Can provide significant speed-up when the\n        number of features is huge. If `None`, all features will be used.\n\n    initial_strategy : {'mean', 'median', 'most_frequent', 'constant'}, \\\n            default='mean'\n        Which strategy to use to initialize the missing values. Same as the\n        `strategy` parameter in :class:`~sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer`.\n\n    fill_value : str or numerical value, default=None\n        When `strategy=\"constant\"`, `fill_value` is used to replace all\n        occurrences of missing_values. For string or object data types,\n        `fill_value` must be a string.\n        If `None`, `fill_value` will be 0 when imputing numerical\n        data and \"missing_value\" for strings or object data types.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 1.3\n\n    imputation_order : {'ascending', 'descending', 'roman', 'arabic', \\",
