    "title": "Warn the user when trees of points or trees of reference frames are not self consistent.",
    "body": "sympy.physics.vector has Point and ReferenceFrame. These can be positioned and oriented relative to objects of their same type, respectively. The user is expected to define relative positions and orientations in a consistent manner and the relationships among the objects should be tree graphs. It would be helpful to warn the user if they set positions and orientations that create incorrect graphs, for example adding a cyclic branch; the graphs should be acyclic. You can also create inconsistencies when it comes to calculating velocities and angular velocities, which is done automatically if possible. Here is a point example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nN = ReferenceFrame('N')\r\nO = Point('O')\r\nP = Point('P')\r\nQ = Point('Q')\r\nP.set_vel(N, N.x)\r\nQ.set_vel(N, N.y)\r\nO.set_pos(P, 5*N.z)\r\nO.set_pos(Q, 6*N.y)\r\nO.vel(N)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe velocities of O in N are different depending on if you calculate based on P or Q. It is also impossible to choose between P or Q. Right now, P or Q will be chosen based on which comes first in `_pos_dict.items()`. We should warn the user that this graph is inconsistent when trying to calculate the velocity of O in N. This same thing can happen with ReferenceFrame.\r\n\r\nI suspect there will be issues when users have kinematic loops and may want to define the loop of point positions that specify the loop. Currently, that is not supported. If you specify a loop through a succession of set_pos() or locate_new() calls, you get an invalid point tree. Kinematic loops have to be dealt with by adding the algebraic equation and forming DAEs instead.\r\n\r\nThese warnings need some careful thought. The first step would be to define precisely what graphs are consistent and non consistent, in terms of physics.vector's capabilities and design. Once that is defined, some methods to check for consistencies can be added. There will be inconsistencies related purely to position and orientation as well as inconsistencies related to the automated calculation of velocities.\r\n\r\nThere is discussion in this PR that is relevant: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/20049\n",

It suggests implementing a method to validate the graph for cycles, which is a core part of the problem. The use of DFS or BFS to detect cycles is a standard approach in graph theory and is applicable here. Modifying the `set_vel` and `set_pos` methods to call this validation and handling the results in the `vel` method are also practical steps that would help address the issue. The suggestion to use a topological sort to handle the order of operations is another relevant solution that could prevent inconsistencies. Additionally, the RESPONSE proposes a mechanism to handle kinematic loops, which is a complex part of the problem mentioned in the PROMPT. The RESPONSE also provides code snippets that could be checked for potential modifications, which adds value to the debugging process. However, the RESPONSE does not fully address the need to define precisely what graphs are consistent and non-consistent, which is an essential first step mentioned in the PROMPT. Therefore, it does not completely resolve the issue but provides substantial guidance towards a solution.",

        "result": "- Implement a method `validate_graph` in the `Point` class to check for cycles in the graph of points and reference frames.\n- Use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to detect cycles.\n- If a cycle is detected, raise an exception or return a value indicating an invalid graph.\n- Modify the `set_vel` and `set_pos` methods in the `Point` class to call `validate_graph` after setting the velocity or position.\n- Ensure that the `vel` method in the `Point` class accounts for the possibility of cycles and handles them appropriately, possibly by using the results from `validate_graph`.\n- Add a user warning system to notify users when an inconsistency in velocity calculations due to cycles is detected.\n- Consider using a topological sort algorithm to handle the order of operations in `_pos_dict.items()` to ensure a valid point tree is formed.\n- Implement a mechanism to handle kinematic loops without forming invalid point trees, possibly by introducing additional methods to handle differential algebraic equations (DAEs) when necessary.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy) \u2192 [physics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/physics) \u2192 [vector](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/physics/vector)- [Lines 1 - 76](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/blob//sympy/physics/vector/frame.py#L1-L76)\n\n This snippet defines the CoordinateSym class and its equality checks, which are relevant to ensuring the consistency of the graph of points and reference frames. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1054 - 1057](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/blob//sympy/physics/vector/frame.py#L1054-L1057)\n\n This snippet contains a method to check if an object is a ReferenceFrame, which is relevant to the issue of ensuring that only objects of the same type are positioned or oriented relative to each other.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy) \u2192 [physics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/physics) \u2192 [mechanics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/physics/mechanics)- [Lines 1 - 8](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/blob//sympy/physics/mechanics/rigidbody.py#L1-L8)\n\n This snippet imports the Point and ReferenceFrame classes from sympy.physics.vector, which are central to the issue of maintaining consistency in their relative positioning and orientation.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy) \u2192 [physics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/physics) \u2192 [mechanics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/physics/mechanics)- [Lines 1 - 9](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/blob//sympy/physics/mechanics/body.py#L1-L9)\n\n This snippet is from the Body class which might be involved in the issue since it deals with points and reference frames.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy) \u2192 [parsing](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/parsing) \u2192 [autolev](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/tree//sympy/parsing/autolev)- [Lines 405 - 473](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.7/blob//sympy/parsing/autolev/_listener_autolev_antlr.py#L405-L473)\n\n This snippet shows the use of ordered dictionaries for symbol tables, which could be relevant when considering the order of operations and definitions in the context of the issue."
