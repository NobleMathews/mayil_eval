    "title": "Delete nonexistent migrations from django_migrations table",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nDjango adds a django_migrations table to the database which list all of the migrations that have been applied (and when).\nWith the introduction of squashmigrations, it is possible for this table to contain a lot of old migrations that no longer exist. This can be problematic if naming duplication occurs:\nExample:\nI have an app with:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial.py\n0002_blah.py\n0003_blah.py\nI squash and delete replaced migrations:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\nI create a new migration and use poor naming:\nmy_app/migrations/\n0001_initial_squashed_0003_blah.py\n0002_blah.py\nMy new migration never runs because the django_migrations table thinks it has already been applied.\nI propose truncation of the django_migrations table so that it includes only migrations that actually exist in the django project. This could be done automatically (when executor runs, or inside the migrate mcommand). Or have its own mcommand that requires it be run manually. I prefer the automatic approach though.\nPros:\nCleans up old data that just bloats the database.\nProtects users from the trap mentioned above where a new migration is created with the same name as one that was applied in the past.\nCons:\nA loss of historical information.\nNote:\nNeed to be careful with implementation to avoid a possible new trap if a user squashes migrations and then proceeds to delete the replaced migrations before running the squashed migrations on their database -> django will think squashed migrations haven't been applied and will attempt to reapply them. This can be remedied simply by not removing migrations mentioned in replaces lists of other migrations from django_migrations (ie. we'd consider replaced migrations as still existing, even if their actual files have already been removed).\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of deleting nonexistent migrations from the `django_migrations` table, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Create a new management command in Django that will be responsible for cleaning up the `django_migrations` table.\n- In the new command, compare the list of migrations in the `django_migrations` table with the actual migration files present in the migrations directories of each app.\n- Exclude any migrations that are mentioned in the `replaces` attribute of existing squashed migrations to avoid the trap described in the ticket.\n- Delete records from the `django_migrations` table that do not have a corresponding migration file and are not part of a `replaces` list.\n- Ensure that this command is idempotent and can be run safely multiple times.\n\nHere is a high-level overview of the implementation in pseudo-code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.management.base import BaseCommand\nfrom django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder\nfrom django.conf import settings\nimport os\n\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    help = \"Deletes nonexistent migrations from the django_migrations table.\"\n\n    def handle(self, *args, **options):\n        # Get the migration recorder instance\n        recorder = MigrationRecorder(None)\n        \n        # Get all migrations from the django_migrations table\n        applied_migrations = recorder.migration_qs.all()\n        \n        # Get all migration files from the disk\n        disk_migrations = self.get_all_migration_files()\n        \n        # Get all migrations that are replaced by squashed migrations\n        replaced_migrations = self.get_replaced_migrations()\n        \n        # Determine which migrations to delete\n        migrations_to_delete = [\n            migration for migration in applied_migrations\n            if (migration.app, migration.name) not in disk_migrations\n            and (migration.app, migration.name) not in replaced_migrations\n        ]\n        \n        # Delete the migrations\n        for migration in migrations_to_delete:\n            migration.delete()\n            if options['verbosity'] > 0:\n                self.stdout.write(f\"Deleted migration {migration.app}.{migration.name} from django_migrations table.\")\n\n    def get_all_migration_files(self):\n        # Logic to collect all migration files from the disk\n        pass\n\n    def get_replaced_migrations(self):\n        # Logic to collect migrations that are replaced by squashed migrations\n        pass\n```\n\nTo implement the `get_all_migration_files` and `get_replaced_migrations` methods, you would need to:\n\n- Traverse the migration directories of each installed app and collect the names of migration files.\n- Check for squashed migrations and collect the migrations they replace.\n\nThis command can then be run manually by the user or integrated into the `migrate` command to run automatically after migrations are applied.\n\nRemember to test this feature thoroughly, especially in cases where squashed migrations are involved, to ensure that no necessary migration records are deleted.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 10 - 82](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/migrations/recorder.py#L10-L82)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/migrations/recorder.py' defines the Migration model which interacts with the 'django_migrations' table.
