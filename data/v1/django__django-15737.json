    "title": "Avoid unnecessary clear of cached reference",
    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Barry Johnson)\n\t \nConsider this case of ORM models \"Parent\" and \"Child\", where Child has a foreign key reference to Parent (and the database can return generated IDs following insert operations):\nparent = Parent(name='parent_object')\nchild = Child(parent=parent)\nparent.save()\nchild.save()\nprint(child.parent.name)\nThe print statement will cause an unnecessary lazy read of the parent object.\nIn the application where this behavior was first observed, the application was creating thousands of parent and child objects using bulk_create(). The subsequent lazy reads occurred when creating log entries to record the action, and added thousands of unwanted SELECT queries.\nClosed ticket #29497 solved a problem with potential data loss in this situation by essentially executing child.parent_id = child.parent.pk while preparing the child object to be saved. However, when the child's ForeignKeyDeferredAttrbute \"parent_id\" changes value from None to the parent's ID, the child's internal cache containing the reference to \"parent\" is cleared. The subsequent reference to child.parent then must do a lazy read and reload parent from the database.\nA workaround to avoid this lazy read is to explicitly update both the \"parent_id\" and \"parent\" cache entry by adding this non-intuitive statement:\nchild.parent = child.parent\nafter executing parent.save()\nBut it appears that a simple change could avoid clearing the cache in this narrow case.\nWithin Model._prepare_related_fields_for_save(), replace\nsetattr(self, field.attname, obj.pk)\nwith\nsetattr(self, field.name, obj)\nThis suggested code has -not- been tested.\nThis change would set the associated \"parent_id\" attribute while ensuring that the currently referenced object remains referenced.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to unnecessary database reads when accessing a related object's fields. The unnecessary reads are likely due to the ORM not utilizing the cached value of a ForeignKey relationship properly. To address this issue:\n\n- Modify the `django/db/models/base.py` `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method to ensure that when setting the related object, it uses the cached value if available and only falls back to setting the `field.attname` if the object's primary key (`obj.pk`) has been set.\n- In the `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` file, ensure that the related object's cache is properly set after assignment and that the cache is used when accessing the related object to avoid unnecessary database queries.\n- Review the logic in `ForeignKeyDeferredAttribute` and `DeferredAttribute` to ensure that they properly check for cached values before triggering a database read.\n- Ensure that the `bulk_create` method properly handles the caching of related objects when creating multiple instances to avoid unnecessary database reads after bulk insert operations.\n\nThe specific code changes would involve:\n\n- In `django/db/models/base.py`, within the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method, adjust the logic to check for a cached value before setting the `field.attname` attribute.\n- In `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, ensure that the `set_cached_value` method is called after setting a ForeignKey field to cache the related object.\n- In the same file, when accessing a ForeignKey field, check if the value is cached using `is_cached` before accessing the database.\n- Review the `bulk_create` method to ensure that it respects the caching mechanism for related fields.\n\nThese changes should be made carefully to ensure that they do not introduce any regressions or new issues, especially considering that the issue mentions that the suggested code change has not been tested.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1107 - 2551](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L1107-L2551)\n\n This snippet contains the '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' method where the issue of clearing the cache is described. The suggested fix is to modify this method to prevent unnecessary lazy reads.",

        "result": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to unnecessary database reads when accessing a related object's fields. The unnecessary reads are likely due to the ORM not utilizing the cached value of a ForeignKey relationship properly. To address this issue:\n\n- Modify the `django/db/models/base.py` `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method to ensure that when setting the related object, it uses the cached value if available and only falls back to setting the `field.attname` if the object's primary key (`obj.pk`) has been set.\n- In the `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` file, ensure that the related object's cache is properly set after assignment and that the cache is used when accessing the related object to avoid unnecessary database queries.\n- Review the logic in `ForeignKeyDeferredAttribute` and `DeferredAttribute` to ensure that they properly check for cached values before triggering a database read.\n- Ensure that the `bulk_create` method properly handles the caching of related objects when creating multiple instances to avoid unnecessary database reads after bulk insert operations.\n\nThe specific code changes would involve:\n\n- In `django/db/models/base.py`, within the `_prepare_related_fields_for_save` method, adjust the logic to check for a cached value before setting the `field.attname` attribute.\n- In `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`, ensure that the `set_cached_value` method is called after setting a ForeignKey field to cache the related object.\n- In the same file, when accessing a ForeignKey field, check if the value is cached using `is_cached` before accessing the database.\n- Review the `bulk_create` method to ensure that it respects the caching mechanism for related fields.\n\nThese changes should be made carefully to ensure that they do not introduce any regressions or new issues, especially considering that the issue mentions that the suggested code change has not been tested.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1107 - 2551](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.2/blob//django/db/models/base.py#L1107-L2551)\n\n This snippet contains the '_prepare_related_fields_for_save' method where the issue of clearing the cache is described. The suggested fix is to modify this method to prevent unnecessary lazy reads."
