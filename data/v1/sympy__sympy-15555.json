The following trailing 10 digits were also\nchecked to be accurate (and the times were slightly faster with\nsome of the constant modifications that were made):\n\n    >> from time import time\n    >> t=time();pi_hex_digits(10**2-10 + 1, 10), time()-t\n    ('e90c6cc0ac', 0.0)\n    >> t=time();pi_hex_digits(10**4-10 + 1, 10), time()-t\n    ('26aab49ec6', 0.17100000381469727)\n    >> t=time();pi_hex_digits(10**5-10 + 1, 10), time()-t\n    ('a22673c1a5', 4.7109999656677246)\n    >> t=time();pi_hex_digits(10**6-10 + 1, 10), time()-t\n    ('9ffd342362', 59.985999822616577)\n    >> t=time();pi_hex_digits(10**7-10 + 1, 10), time()-t\n    ('c1a42e06a1', 689.51800012588501)\n\n2.
