But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The issue is with the `TfidfVectorizer` class not respecting the `dtype` argument in its `fit_transform` method.\n- The relevant code snippet is not provided in the given excerpts.\n- To solve the issue, ensure that the `fit_transform` method of the `TfidfVectorizer` class uses the `dtype` specified during the initialization of the object when returning the transformed data.\n- The solution should look something like this:\n\n```python\nclass TfidfVectorizer(CountVectorizer):\n    def __init__(self, ..., dtype=np.float64, ...):\n        ...\n        self.dtype = dtype\n        ...\n\n    def fit_transform(self, raw_documents, ...):\n        ...\n        # Perform the transformation and return the result with the specified dtype\n        return some_array.astype(self.dtype)\n```\n\n- Make sure that the transformation process within `fit_transform` (e.g., the creation of the term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix) uses the `self.dtype` attribute when creating the output array.\n- If the issue persists after these changes, it may be necessary to check if there are any hardcoded `np.float64` types within the `fit_transform` method or any methods it calls and replace them with `self.dtype`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [feature_extraction](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn/feature_extraction)- [Lines 1752 - 1752](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/blob//sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py#L1752-L1752)\n\n This snippet indicates the class where the issue is likely to be found, as TfidfVectorizer is the class in question.\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [utils](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn/utils)- [Lines 181 - 4630](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/blob//sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py#L181-L4630)\n\n This snippet contains tests that check if estimators preserve dtypes, which is relevant to the issue of TfidfVectorizer not preserving the specified dtype.\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn)- [Lines 411 - 570](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/blob//sklearn/kernel_approximation.py#L411-L570)\n\n This snippet shows a method that specifies which dtypes are preserved by an estimator, which could be relevant to understanding how TfidfVectorizer handles dtypes.\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [neighbors](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/tree//sklearn/neighbors)- [Lines 513 - 516](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.20/blob//sklearn/neighbors/_lof.py#L513-L516)\n\n Similar to snippet #5, this snippet shows dtype preservation in another estimator, which could provide insight into how dtype should be handled in TfidfVectorizer.",

For instance,\n    a feature \"f\" that can take on the values \"ham\" and \"spam\" will become two\n    features in the output, one signifying \"f=ham\", the other \"f=spam\".\n\n    If a feature value is a sequence or set of strings, this transformer\n    will iterate over the values and will count the occurrences of each string\n    value.\n\n    However, note that this transformer will only do a binary one-hot encoding\n    when feature values are of type string. If categorical features are\n    represented as numeric values such as int or iterables of strings, the\n    DictVectorizer can be followed by\n    :class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` to complete\n    binary one-hot encoding.\n\n    Features that do not occur in a sample (mapping) will have a zero value\n    in the resulting array/matrix.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <dict_feature_extraction>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    dtype : dtype, default=np.float64\n        The type of feature values.
