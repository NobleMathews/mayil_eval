When the actual body of the request is being constructed, python attempts to coerce the entire request into unicode resulting in the decode error.\n\nAfter tracing it, the cause is the following lines:\n\nrequests/models.py: \n\n```\nself.prepare_content_length(body)\n# -------\nl = super_len(body)\nself.headers['Content-Length'] = str(l)\n```\n\nwhere `str = unicode` is declared in compat.py\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Remove the `str = unicode` declaration in `compat.py` to prevent forcing a unicode conversion where it's not applicable.\n- Ensure that the `Content-Length` header is set to a string representation of the content length, not a unicode object. Modify the `prepare_content_length` function in `requests/models.py` to cast the length to a string using `str()` instead of `builtin_str()` if that's causing the issue.\n- Check the `super_len` function in `requests/utils.py` to ensure it returns an integer value for the length, as this value is used to set the `Content-Length` header.\n- If the `Content-Length` header is being set elsewhere in the code, ensure it is being set as a string, not a unicode object.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/tree//requests)- [Lines 573 - 638](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/models.py#L573-L638)\n\n This snippet contains the code where the 'Content-Length' header is set, which is directly related to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/tree//requests)- [Lines 133 - 196](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/utils.py#L133-L196)\n\n This snippet defines the 'super_len' function used to calculate the content length, which is part of the problem.\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/tree//requests)- [Lines 1 - 79](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/compat.py#L1-L79)\n\n This snippet from 'compat.py' shows where 'str' is defined, which is relevant to the issue since 'str' is being used to set the 'Content-Length' header.",
