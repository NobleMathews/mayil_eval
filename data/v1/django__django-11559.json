    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Jonny Fuller)\n\t \nHi friends,\nDuring testing I discovered a strange bug when using a query expression for ordering during multi-table inheritance. You can find the full write up as well as reproducible test repository \u200bhttps://github.com/JonnyWaffles/djangoordermetabug. The bug occurs because the field is an OrderBy object, not a string, during get_order_dir. The linked stacktrace should make the issue obvious, but what I don't understand is why it only fails during test db setup, not during repl or script use. I wish I could help more and come up with a real solution. Hopefully, this is enough for someone wiser to find the culprit.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information and code snippets, the issue seems to be related to the ordering of query results using expressions in a multi-table inheritance scenario during test database setup. The `OrderBy` object is not being handled as expected by the `get_order_dir` function. To address this issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `OrderBy` object is properly deconstructed to be used in migrations, as indicated by the `@deconstructible` decorator in `expressions.py`.\n- Verify that the `OrderableAggMixin` in `mixins.py` correctly handles the `OrderByList` object, especially in the `resolve_expression` and `as_sql` methods.\n- In `sql/compiler.py`, check the logic within the loop `for expr, is_ref in self._order_by_pairs():` to ensure that the `OrderBy` object is correctly resolved and compiled, especially when dealing with multi-table inheritance.\n- Confirm that the `OrderBy` class in `expressions.py` is correctly implemented and can handle expressions involving fields from inherited tables.\n- Review the `sql/compiler.py` code that handles the ordering, particularly the sections that parse the `field` variable and create `OrderBy` objects. Ensure that the logic correctly supports multi-table inheritance and does not raise a `DatabaseError` when combining queries.\n- Check the `sql/compiler.py` code that determines the `ordering` variable, ensuring that it correctly falls back to `Meta.ordering` when appropriate and handles the default ordering correctly.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you may need to:\n\n- Modify the `OrderBy` class to handle expressions involving fields from inherited tables correctly.\n- Adjust the `OrderableAggMixin` to ensure that `OrderByList` objects are properly resolved and compiled.\n- Update the logic in `sql/compiler.py` that creates `OrderBy` objects from the parsed `field` variable to support multi-table inheritance without errors.\n- Ensure that the `ordering` variable in `sql/compiler.py` is set correctly based on the context (e.g., `extra_order_by`, `default_ordering`, `query.order_by`, `Meta.ordering`).\n\nSince the issue occurs during test database setup but not in other environments, it's also important to consider differences in database backends or configurations between test and production environments that might affect the ordering behavior.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 459 - 1596](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L459-L1596)\n\n This snippet contains logic for ordering in SQL compiler, which is likely where the issue with OrderBy object not being a string is occurring. \n\n\n   - [Lines 317 - 341](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L317-L341)\n\n This snippet deals with the determination of ordering in the SQL compiler, which could be relevant to the issue if the Meta.ordering expressions are being handled here. \n\n\n   - [Lines 344 - 1464](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L344-L1464)\n\n This snippet includes logic for resolving expressions related to ordering, which could be relevant to the issue if the OrderBy object is not being handled correctly. \n\n\n   - [Lines 405 - 1949](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L405-L1949)\n\n This snippet is part of the logic that handles ordering in SQL compiler and could be relevant if the issue arises from how OrderBy objects are created from strings.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1607 - 1607](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L1607-L1607)\n\n This snippet defines the OrderBy class, which is central to the issue as the OrderBy object is not being treated as a string. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1606 - 1606](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/db/models/expressions.py#L1606-L1606)\n\n This snippet shows the deconstructible decorator for the OrderBy class, which might be relevant if the issue is related to serialization or deconstruction of OrderBy objects.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django) \u2192 [contrib](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/contrib) \u2192 [postgres](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/contrib/postgres) \u2192 [aggregates](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/tree//django/contrib/postgres/aggregates)- [Lines 1 - 29](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.0/blob//django/contrib/postgres/aggregates/mixins.py#L1-L29)\n\n This snippet is from the OrderableAggMixin class which uses OrderByList, and could be relevant if the issue is related to how ordering is being initialized or resolved.",
