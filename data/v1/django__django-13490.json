    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the use of `get()` after `difference()` on a Django `QuerySet`. The `MultipleObjectsReturned` exception is raised unexpectedly, which indicates that the `get()` method is returning more than one object when it should only return one.\n\nTo address this issue:\n\n- Ensure that the `get()` method is used with a filter that uniquely identifies a single object. The `get()` method should only be used when you expect to return exactly one object. If there's a possibility of returning multiple objects, use `filter()` and handle the resulting QuerySet accordingly.\n- If the `difference()` operation is expected to return a unique set of objects, but `get()` is still raising `MultipleObjectsReturned`, it might be a bug in Django's ORM when chaining these methods. As a workaround, evaluate the QuerySet before calling `get()` by converting it to a list or using `first()` if you expect a single object:\n  ```python\n  qs3 = list(qs1.difference(qs2))\n  obj = next((x for x in qs3 if x.id == 2), None)\n  ```\n  or\n  ```python\n  obj = qs1.difference(qs2).filter(id=2).first()\n  ```\n- If the issue persists, consider checking the Django project's issue tracker to see if this is a known bug with the `difference()` method in the version of Django you are using (3.1.2). If it is a bug and there's no existing solution, you may need to update to a newer version of Django where the bug is fixed, or avoid chaining `difference()` with `get()` and use an alternative approach to achieve the desired result.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1468 - 1528](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1468-L1528)\n\n This snippet contains the difference method which is directly related to the issue described.
