    "mayil_response": "- Update the `Permutation` class constructor in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` to accept a `Tuple` instead of a `list` for the `args` parameter.\n- Replace any explicit type checks or conversions from `list` to `Tuple` within the `Permutation` class methods.\n- Ensure that all calls to the `Permutation` constructor throughout the codebase pass a `Tuple` instead of a `list`.\n- Modify the `_mk_Tuple` function in `sympy/codegen/ast.py` if it is used to create `Tuple` objects that are passed to the `Permutation` constructor, ensuring compatibility with the updated type expectations.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [combinatorics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/combinatorics)- [Lines 907 - 953](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py#L907-L953)\n\n This snippet contains the constructor logic for the Permutation class, where the type of the arguments is checked and processed. Since the issue mentions changing the subtype of args from 'list' to 'Tuple', this snippet is directly relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 20 - 906](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py#L20-L906)\n\n This snippet includes the docstring for the Permutation constructor, which provides examples and explanations of how to use the constructor. It is relevant because the documentation may need to be updated to reflect the change from 'list' to 'Tuple'. \n\n\n   - [Lines 466 - 466](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py#L466-L466)\n\n This snippet shows the class definition of Permutation. It is relevant because any change to the constructor or the handling of arguments may require a review of the class definition.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [combinatorics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/combinatorics)- [Lines 1 - 8](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/polyhedron.py#L1-L8)\n\n This snippet imports the Permutation class and uses it. Changes to the Permutation class constructor could potentially affect how it is used in this file.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 19 - 19](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/core/containers.py#L19-L19)\n\n This snippet shows the class definition of Tuple in sympy.core.containers. Since the issue involves changing the subtype of args to 'Tuple', it is relevant to understand how Tuple is defined and used in SymPy.",

        "result": "- Update the `Permutation` class constructor in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` to accept a `Tuple` instead of a `list` for the `args` parameter.\n- Replace any explicit type checks or conversions from `list` to `Tuple` within the `Permutation` class methods.\n- Ensure that all calls to the `Permutation` constructor throughout the codebase pass a `Tuple` instead of a `list`.\n- Modify the `_mk_Tuple` function in `sympy/codegen/ast.py` if it is used to create `Tuple` objects that are passed to the `Permutation` constructor, ensuring compatibility with the updated type expectations.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [combinatorics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/combinatorics)- [Lines 907 - 953](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py#L907-L953)\n\n This snippet contains the constructor logic for the Permutation class, where the type of the arguments is checked and processed. Since the issue mentions changing the subtype of args from 'list' to 'Tuple', this snippet is directly relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 20 - 906](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py#L20-L906)\n\n This snippet includes the docstring for the Permutation constructor, which provides examples and explanations of how to use the constructor. It is relevant because the documentation may need to be updated to reflect the change from 'list' to 'Tuple'. \n\n\n   - [Lines 466 - 466](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py#L466-L466)\n\n This snippet shows the class definition of Permutation. It is relevant because any change to the constructor or the handling of arguments may require a review of the class definition.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [combinatorics](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/combinatorics)- [Lines 1 - 8](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/combinatorics/polyhedron.py#L1-L8)\n\n This snippet imports the Permutation class and uses it. Changes to the Permutation class constructor could potentially affect how it is used in this file.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 19 - 19](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.5/blob//sympy/core/containers.py#L19-L19)\n\n This snippet shows the class definition of Tuple in sympy.core.containers. Since the issue involves changing the subtype of args to 'Tuple', it is relevant to understand how Tuple is defined and used in SymPy."
