    "title": "Allow makemigrations to skip database consistency checks",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nCurrently makemigrations always requires an active database connection, due to it executing loader.check_consistent_history() here: \u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/290d8471bba35980f3e228f9c171afc40f2550fa/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L93-L101\nSometimes you are making a change on a machine that doesn't have a database set up or is configured to use a database on a host that isn't resolvable (i.e a postgres host that's only resolvable within docker-compose). If you run makemigrations on such a machine it will fail while attempting to check the migrations consistency, which is quite annoying. The solution seems to either add a django.db.backends.dummy backend for such cases or start a database server locally.\nI'd like to add a flag to skip the consistency check in these situations, or fail gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature of allowing `makemigrations` to skip database consistency checks, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Add a new command-line argument to the `makemigrations` command to allow skipping the consistency check.\n- Modify the `makemigrations` command to conditionally skip the call to `loader.check_consistent_history()` based on the new argument.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes needed in the `makemigrations.py` file:\n\n1. Add a new argument to the `add_arguments` method of the `MakemigrationsCommand` class:\n\n```python\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    # ...\n\n    def add_arguments(self, parser):\n        # Existing arguments\n        # ...\n        parser.add_argument(\n            '--skip-checks', action='store_true',\n            help='Skip the database consistency checks.'\n        )\n```\n\n2. Modify the `handle` method to use the new `--skip-checks` argument:\n\n```python\nclass Command(BaseCommand):\n    # ...\n\n    def handle(self, *app_labels, **options):\n        # ...\n        skip_checks = options['skip_checks']\n        # ...\n\n        # Before the existing call to check_consistent_history\n        if not skip_checks:\n            executor.loader.check_consistent_history(connection)\n        # ...\n```\n\n3. Update the documentation to include the new `--skip-checks` flag.\n\n4. Write tests to ensure that the new flag works as expected.\n\nRemember to follow the contribution guidelines of the Django project if you plan to submit this as a patch. This includes writing tests, updating documentation, and following the coding style of the project.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 11 - 355](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/migrations/executor.py#L11-L355)\n\n This snippet from 'django/db/migrations/executor.py' contains the logic for detecting if a migration should be applied and interacts with the database. It is relevant because the issue is about skipping database consistency checks during makemigrations, and changes here might be necessary to implement the new flag to skip consistency checks.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 98 - 152](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/core/management/commands/migrate.py#L98-L152)\n\n This snippet from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' shows the use of 'check_consistent_history' in the migrate command. It is relevant because the issue mentions 'loader.check_consistent_history()' and this snippet could provide insight into how the check is currently being used in a similar context.",

It suggests adding a new command-line argument, modifying the `makemigrations` command to conditionally skip the check, updating documentation, and writing tests. The RESPONSE also includes code snippets to illustrate the changes needed, which is highly relevant and useful for developers. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not address the part of the prompt about failing gracefully if the connection to the database isn't available, which was also a part of the feature request.",

It is relevant because the issue is about skipping database consistency checks during makemigrations, and changes here might be necessary to implement the new flag to skip consistency checks.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 98 - 152](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/core/management/commands/migrate.py#L98-L152)\n\n This snippet from 'django/core/management/commands/migrate.py' shows the use of 'check_consistent_history' in the migrate command. It is relevant because the issue mentions 'loader.check_consistent_history()' and this snippet could provide insight into how the check is currently being used in a similar context."
