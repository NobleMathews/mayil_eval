    "mayil_response": "- The issue is with the `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` not correctly passing `sample_weight` to the `fit` method of the initial estimator when it is a pipeline.\n- The solution is to modify the `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` to correctly pass `sample_weight` to the pipeline's `fit` method.\n\nTo resolve the issue, update the `fit` method in `sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py` for the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class:\n\n```python\ndef fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):\n    # ... [other code] ...\n    if self.init_ is not None:\n        self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight=sample_weight)\n    # ... [other code] ...\n```\n\nEnsure that the `fit` method of the `init` estimator (which is a pipeline in this case) can accept and correctly handle the `sample_weight` parameter. If the `init` estimator's `fit` method does not accept `sample_weight`, you may need to modify the pipeline or the estimators within it to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/ensemble)- [Lines 835 - 1077](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py#L835-L1077)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of the GradientBoostingRegressor class, which is relevant to the issue as the problem is with the 'init' parameter of this class. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1398 - 1824](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py#L1398-L1824)\n\n This snippet contains the detailed implementation of the GradientBoostingRegressor class, including the 'fit' method where the issue is likely to be located.",

In\n    each stage ``n_classes_`` regression trees are fit on the negative gradient\n    of the loss function, e.g. binary or multiclass log loss. Binary\n    classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is\n    induced.\n\n    :class:`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is a much faster\n    variant of this algorithm for intermediate datasets (`n_samples >= 10_000`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    loss : {'log_loss', 'exponential'}, default='log_loss'\n        The loss function to be optimized. 'log_loss' refers to binomial and\n        multinomial deviance, the same as used in logistic regression.\n        It is a good choice for classification with probabilistic outputs.\n        For loss 'exponential', gradient boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.\n\n    learning_rate : float, default=0.1\n        Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.\n        There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.\n        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.\n\n    n_estimators : int, default=100\n        The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting\n        is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually\n        results in better performance.\n        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.\n\n    subsample : float, default=1.0\n        The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base\n        learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient\n        Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.\n        Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance\n        and an increase in bias.\n        Values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`.\n\n    criterion : {'friedman_mse', 'squared_error'}, default='friedman_mse'\n        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are\n        'friedman_mse' for the mean squared error with improvement score by\n        Friedman, 'squared_error' for mean squared error. The default value of\n        'friedman_mse' is generally the best as it can provide a better\n        approximation in some cases.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.18\n\n    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2\n        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:\n\n        - If int, values must be in the range `[2, inf)`.\n        - If float, values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]` and `min_samples_split`\n          will be `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)`.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.18\n           Added float values for fractions.\n\n    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1\n        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at\n        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and\n        right branches.

Samples have\n        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.\n        Values must be in the range `[0.0, 0.5]`.\n\n    max_depth : int or None, default=3\n        Maximum depth of the individual regression estimators. The maximum\n        depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter\n        for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction\n        of the input variables. If None, then nodes are expanded until\n        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than\n        min_samples_split samples.\n        If int, values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.\n\n    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0\n        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity\n        greater than or equal to this value.\n        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.\n\n        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::\n\n            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity\n                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)\n\n        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of\n        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the\n        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.\n\n        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,\n        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.19\n\n    init : estimator or 'zero', default=None\n        An estimator object that is used to compute the initial predictions.\n        ``init`` has to provide :term:`fit` and :term:`predict_proba`. If\n        'zero', the initial raw predictions are set to zero. By default, a\n        ``DummyEstimator`` predicting the classes priors is used.\n\n    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None\n        Controls the random seed given to each Tree estimator at each\n        boosting iteration.\n        In addition, it controls the random permutation of the features at\n        each split (see Notes for more details).\n        It also controls the random splitting of the training data to obtain a\n        validation set if `n_iter_no_change` is not None.\n        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.\n        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.\n\n    max_features : {'sqrt', 'log2'}, int or float, default=None\n        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:\n\n        - If int, values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.\n        - If float, values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]` and the features\n          considered at each split will be `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))`.\n        - If 'sqrt', then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.\n        - If 'log2', then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.\n        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.\n\n        Choosing `max_features < n_features` leads to a reduction of variance\n        and an increase in bias.\n\n        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one\n        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to\n        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.\n\n    verbose : int, default=0\n        Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints progress and performance\n        once in a while (the more trees the lower the frequency). If greater\n        than 1 then it prints progress and performance for every tree.\n        Values must be in the range `[0, inf)`.\n\n    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None\n        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.\n        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.\n        Values must be in the range `[2, inf)`.\n        If `None`, then unlimited number of leaf nodes.\n\n    warm_start : bool, default=False\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just erase the\n        previous solution.

By\n        default it is set to None to disable early stopping. If set to a\n        number, it will set aside ``validation_fraction`` size of the training\n        data as validation and terminate training when validation score is not\n        improving in all of the previous ``n_iter_no_change`` numbers of\n        iterations.

In\n    each stage ``n_classes_`` regression trees are fit on the negative gradient\n    of the loss function, e.g. binary or multiclass log loss. Binary\n    classification is a special case where only a single regression tree is\n    induced.\n\n    :class:`sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` is a much faster\n    variant of this algorithm for intermediate datasets (`n_samples >= 10_000`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <gradient_boosting>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    loss : {'log_loss', 'exponential'}, default='log_loss'\n        The loss function to be optimized. 'log_loss' refers to binomial and\n        multinomial deviance, the same as used in logistic regression.\n        It is a good choice for classification with probabilistic outputs.\n        For loss 'exponential', gradient boosting recovers the AdaBoost algorithm.\n\n    learning_rate : float, default=0.1\n        Learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by `learning_rate`.\n        There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.\n        Values must be in the range `[0.0, inf)`.\n\n    n_estimators : int, default=100\n        The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting\n        is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually\n        results in better performance.\n        Values must be in the range `[1, inf)`.\n\n    subsample : float, default=1.0\n        The fraction of samples to be used for fitting the individual base\n        learners. If smaller than 1.0 this results in Stochastic Gradient\n        Boosting. `subsample` interacts with the parameter `n_estimators`.\n        Choosing `subsample < 1.0` leads to a reduction of variance\n        and an increase in bias.\n        Values must be in the range `(0.0, 1.0]`.\n\n    criterion : {'friedman_mse', 'squared_error'}, default='friedman_mse'\n        The function to measure the quality of a split.

        "result": "- The issue is with the `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` not correctly passing `sample_weight` to the `fit` method of the initial estimator when it is a pipeline.\n- The solution is to modify the `fit` method of `GradientBoostingRegressor` to correctly pass `sample_weight` to the pipeline's `fit` method.\n\nTo resolve the issue, update the `fit` method in `sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py` for the `GradientBoostingRegressor` class:\n\n```python\ndef fit(self, X, y, sample_weight=None):\n    # ... [other code] ...\n    if self.init_ is not None:\n        self.init_.fit(X, y, sample_weight=sample_weight)\n    # ... [other code] ...\n```\n\nEnsure that the `fit` method of the `init` estimator (which is a pipeline in this case) can accept and correctly handle the `sample_weight` parameter. If the `init` estimator's `fit` method does not accept `sample_weight`, you may need to modify the pipeline or the estimators within it to ensure compatibility.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/ensemble)- [Lines 835 - 1077](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py#L835-L1077)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of the GradientBoostingRegressor class, which is relevant to the issue as the problem is with the 'init' parameter of this class. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1398 - 1824](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py#L1398-L1824)\n\n This snippet contains the detailed implementation of the GradientBoostingRegressor class, including the 'fit' method where the issue is likely to be located."
