    "title": "Deprecate passing unsaved objects to related filters.",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nConsider this filter:\nFoo.objects.filter(related_obj=bar)\nWhere 'bar' is an unsaved object instance. In Django 1.11, this would always return an empty QuerySet (since no Foo object is related to unsaved 'bar'). In Django 2.0 through 2.2, this is equivalent to doing (which can return a non-empty QuerySet):\nFoo.objects.filter(related_obj=None)\nI found a somewhat related issue that touches on this subject: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/27985\nMy questions:\nWhat is the intended behaviour? In the aforementioned issue Simon Charette suggests that unsaved objects should be prevented from being used in related filters. I agree with that.\nIs this documented anywhere? I couldn't find anything. At the very least this should be documented somewhere.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Intended behavior: The intended behavior, as suggested by Simon Charette in the related issue, is to prevent unsaved objects from being used in related filters. This is to avoid silent data loss or unexpected behavior when filtering with an unsaved object instance.\n\n- Documentation: As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, there is no specific documentation that explicitly states the behavior when filtering with unsaved objects. However, the Django documentation generally assumes that objects used in queries are saved and have a primary key.\n\n- Code changes: To enforce this behavior, you would need to modify the Django ORM to raise an error when an unsaved object is used in a filter. This could be done by checking if the object has a primary key before allowing it to be used in a filter.\n\nHere is a pseudo code snippet that could be added to the `check_related_objects` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to enforce this behavior:\n\n```python\ndef check_related_objects(self, field, value, opts):\n    # ... existing checks ...\n\n    # Check for unsaved object instances in related filters\n    if hasattr(value, 'pk') and value.pk is None:\n        raise ValueError(\n            \"Cannot filter using an unsaved object instance.\"\n        )\n\n    # ... rest of the method ...\n```\n\nThis change would raise a `ValueError` whenever an attempt is made to filter using an unsaved object instance, thus enforcing the intended behavior.",

This module defines the descriptor classes.\n\nForward accessors follow foreign keys. Reverse accessors trace them back. For\nexample, with the following models::\n\n    class Parent(Model):\n        pass\n\n    class Child(Model):\n        parent = ForeignKey(Parent, related_name='children')\n\n ``child.parent`` is a forward many-to-one relation. ``parent.children`` is a\nreverse many-to-one relation.\n\nThere are three types of relations (many-to-one, one-to-one, and many-to-many)\nand two directions (forward and reverse) for a total of six combinations.\n\n1. Related instance on the forward side of a many-to-one relation:\n   ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Uniqueness of foreign key values is irrelevant to accessing the related\n   instance, making the many-to-one and one-to-one cases identical as far as\n   the descriptor is concerned. The constraint is checked upstream (unicity\n   validation in forms) or downstream (unique indexes in the database).\n\n2. Related instance on the forward side of a one-to-one\n   relation: ``ForwardOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   It avoids querying the database when accessing the parent link field in\n   a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n\n3. Related instance on the reverse side of a one-to-one relation:\n   ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   One-to-one relations are asymmetrical, despite the apparent symmetry of the\n   name, because they're implemented in the database with a foreign key from\n   one table to another. As a consequence ``ReverseOneToOneDescriptor`` is\n   slightly different from ``ForwardManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n4. Related objects manager for related instances on the reverse side of a\n   many-to-one relation: ``ReverseManyToOneDescriptor``.\n\n   Unlike the previous two classes, this one provides access to a collection\n   of objects. It returns a manager rather than an instance.\n\n5. Related objects manager for related instances on the forward or reverse\n   sides of a many-to-many relation: ``ManyToManyDescriptor``.\n\n   Many-to-many relations are symmetrical. The syntax of Django models\n   requires declaring them on one side but that's an implementation detail.\n   They could be declared on the other side without any change in behavior.\n   Therefore the forward and reverse descriptors can be the same.\n\n   If you're looking for ``ForwardManyToManyDescriptor`` or\n   ``ReverseManyToManyDescriptor``, use ``ManyToManyDescriptor`` instead.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom asgiref.sync import sync_to_async\n\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldError\nfrom django.db import (\n    DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS,\n    NotSupportedError,\n    connections,\n    router,\n    transaction,\n)\nfrom django.db.models import Q, Window, signals",
