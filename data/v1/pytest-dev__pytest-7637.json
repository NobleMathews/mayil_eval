    "mayil_response": "To reintroduce the warnings that were postponed in the 6.0 release of pytest, follow these steps:\n\n- Identify the warnings that were suppressed in the 6.0 release by reviewing the pull request at https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/7362.\n- Locate the code where these warnings were suppressed. This might involve searching for `warnings.filterwarnings` calls or any other mechanism used to suppress warnings.\n- Revert the changes made in the pull request that suppressed the warnings. This could involve removing lines of code that suppress the warnings or reverting the entire commit.\n- Ensure that the warnings are now displayed by running the test suite and checking for the presence of the warnings.\n- Update the documentation and changelog to inform users that these warnings have been reintroduced.\n- If necessary, adjust the warning messages to provide guidance on how to address the warnings.\n- Create a pull request for the reintroduction of the warnings, targeting the 6.1 release branch.\n- Ensure that all continuous integration checks pass and that the reintroduction of the warnings does not cause any unintended side effects.\n- Request a review from other maintainers to ensure that the reintroduction of the warnings is appropriate and does not conflict with other changes.\n\nHere is a pseudo-code example of how to revert a warning suppression:\n\n```python\n# Example of code that might have been added to suppress a warning\nimport warnings\n\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=DeprecationWarning, message=\"some deprecation message\")\n\n# To reintroduce the warning, simply remove the above lines or adjust the filter\n# For example, change \"ignore\" to \"default\" to show the warning again\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"default\", category=DeprecationWarning, message=\"some deprecation message\")\n```\n\nRemember to test the changes thoroughly and update any tests that may have been expecting the warnings to be suppressed.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n- - [Lines 73 - 108](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__6.0/blob//.pre-commit-config.yaml#L73-L108)\n\n This snippet contains pre-commit hook configurations that include deprecated warnings for the 'py' library, which are relevant to reintroducing warnings.",
