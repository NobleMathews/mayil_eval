    "title": "fps should print as a formal power series",
    "body": "When I first used `fps`, I didn't realize it really was a formal power series as it claims to be, because it prints like a normal series (same as `series`)\n\n```\nIn [21]: fps(sin(x))\nOut[21]:\n     3     5\n    x     x     \u239b 6\u239e\nx - \u2500\u2500 + \u2500\u2500\u2500 + O\u239dx \u23a0\n    6    120\n```\n\nBut if you look at the string form, you see\n\n```\nIn [22]: print(fps(sin(x)))\nFormalPowerSeries(sin(x), x, 0, 1, (SeqFormula(Piecewise(((-1/4)**(_k/2 - 1/2)/(RisingFactorial(3/2, _k/2 - 1/2)*factorial(_k/2 - 1/2)), Eq(Mod(_k, 2), 1)), (0, True)), (_k, 2, oo)), SeqFormula(x**_k, (_k, 0, oo)), x))\n```\n\nThat is, it really does represent it as the formula `Sum((-1)**n/factorial(2*n + 1)*x**n, (n, 0, oo))` (albiet, not simplified). It out to print it like this, so you can see that that's what it's working with.\n\nSide question: if you enter something it can't compute, it just returns the function\n\n```\nIn [25]: fps(tan(x))\nOut[25]: tan(x)\n```\n\nIs that intentional? It seems like it ought to raise an exception in that case. \n\n@leosartaj \n\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Modify the `FormalPowerSeries` class to include a custom string representation method that formats the output as a formal power series representation.\n- Implement a `__str__` or `__repr__` method in the `FormalPowerSeries` class to return the string form of the formal power series, such as `Sum((-1)**n/factorial(2*n + 1)*x**n, (n, 0, oo))`.\n- For handling cases where `fps` cannot compute the series, such as `tan(x)`, raise a specific exception within the `fps` function when the computation is not possible.\n- Add an error handling mechanism in the `fps` function to catch the case when the series cannot be computed and raise a descriptive exception, such as `NotImplementedError` with a message indicating that the series cannot be computed for the given function.\n- Ensure that the `FormalPowerSeries` class and the `fps` function are consistent in their error handling and representation logic.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/tree//sympy) \u2192 [series](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/tree//sympy/series)- [Lines 1714 - 1792](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/blob//sympy/series/formal.py#L1714-L1792)\n\n This snippet contains the 'fps' function which is the main focus of the issue.

There can be two types of constant terms in the series:\n\n        + A constant value or symbol.\n        + A term of a multivariate series not involving the generator, with\n          respect to which the series is to expanded.\n\n      Strictly speaking, a generator of a ring should not be considered a\n      constant. However, for series expansion both the cases need similar\n      treatment (as the user doesn't care about inner details), i.e, use an\n      addition formula to separate the constant part and the variable part (see\n      rs_sin for reference).\n\n    - All the algorithms used here are primarily designed to work for Taylor\n      series (number of iterations in the algo equals the required order).\n      Hence, it becomes tricky to get the series of the right order if a\n      Puiseux series is input. Use rs_puiseux? in your function if your\n      algorithm is not designed to handle fractional powers.\n\nExtending rs_series\n-------------------\n\nTo make a function work with rs_series you need to do two things::\n\n    - Many sure it works with a constant term (as explained above).\n    - If the series contains constant terms, you might need to extend its ring.\n      You do so by adding the new terms to the rings as generators.\n      ``PolyRing.compose`` and ``PolyRing.add_gens`` are two functions that do\n      so and need to be called every time you expand a series containing a\n      constant term.\n\nLook at rs_sin and rs_series for further reference.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom sympy.polys.domains import QQ, EX\nfrom sympy.polys.rings import PolyElement, ring, sring\nfrom sympy.polys.polyerrors import DomainError\nfrom sympy.polys.monomials import (monomial_min, monomial_mul, monomial_div,\n                                   monomial_ldiv)\nfrom mpmath.libmp.libintmath import ifac\nfrom sympy.core import PoleError, Function, Expr\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import Rational, igcd\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import as_int\nfrom sympy.functions import sin, cos, tan, atan, exp, atanh, tanh, log, ceiling\nfrom mpmath.libmp.libintmath import giant_steps\nimport math",
