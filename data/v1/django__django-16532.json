The vault Incident model has an M2M involving the incidents Incident model.

    "mayil_response": "- Update the `vault/models.py` to explicitly define the `through` model for the `ManyToManyField` relationship between `vault.Incident` and `incidents.Incident` before renaming the `Incident` model to `Folder`.\n- Create a new migration file before `vault.0002_rename_incident_folder` that creates the explicit `through` model for the M2M relationship.\n- In the new migration file, use `migrations.CreateModel` to create the `through` model and `migrations.AddField` to add the `ManyToManyField` with the `through` argument.\n- Update the `related_incidents` field in `vault/models.py` to use the new `through` model:\n  ```python\n  related_incidents = models.ManyToManyField(\n      'incidents.Incident',\n      related_name='vault_incidents',\n      through='VaultIncidentRelation',  # Replace with your through model name\n      # other field options\n  )\n  ```\n- Create a migration for the changes made to `vault/models.py`.\n- Ensure the new `through` model has two `ForeignKey` fields pointing to `vault.Incident` and `incidents.Incident` respectively, and define a `Meta` class with the `db_table` attribute set to the name of the table that Django would have automatically created for the M2M relationship.\n- After creating the explicit `through` model and updating the `related_incidents` field, run the `RenameModel` operation in `vault.0002_rename_incident_folder` to rename `Incident` to `Folder`.\n- Make sure to update any references to the old `Incident` model in the `through` model to point to the new `Folder` model after the rename operation.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 921 - 977](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L921-L977)\n\n This snippet is relevant because it deals with the detection of field renames during migrations, which is related to the issue of renaming a model that is part of an M2M relationship with another model of the same name. \n\n\n   - [Lines 237 - 1683](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L237-L1683)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it handles the renaming of fields and models, including the handling of remote fields, which is directly related to the issue of renaming models in M2M relationships. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1122 - 1216](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L1122-L1216)\n\n This snippet is relevant because it includes logic for handling changes to fields, including many-to-many fields, which is pertinent to the issue of renaming models involved in M2M relationships. \n\n\n   - [Lines 522 - 977](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/migrations/autodetector.py#L522-L977)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it includes logic for detecting and handling model renames, which is part of the issue when renaming a model that is involved in an M2M relationship.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 98 - 525](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/models.py#L98-L525)\n\n This snippet is relevant because it contains the implementation of the RenameModel operation, which is failing according to the issue description.",

            "supporting_evidence": "The RESPONSE provides a detailed, step-by-step solution to the problem of renaming a model that is part of a ManyToMany (M2M) relationship with another model of the same name. It suggests creating an explicit 'through' model for the M2M relationship, which is a valid approach to resolving the ambiguity caused by having two models with the same name. The RESPONSE also includes instructions for creating the necessary migrations, updating the 'related_incidents' field, and ensuring that references to the old model are updated after the rename operation. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides relevant code snippets from the Django source code that could help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of migrations and model renaming. The RESPONSE is comprehensive and addresses the issue in a manner that is likely to resolve the bug.",
