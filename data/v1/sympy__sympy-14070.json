    "mayil_response": "- Review the implementation of `logcombine` in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to ensure it correctly simplifies expressions like `log(3) - log(2)` to `log(3/2)`.\n- Ensure that the `logcombine` function checks for the conditions under which logarithms can be combined, such as when the arguments are positive or when `force=True` is specified.\n- Verify that the `logcombine` function is correctly identifying and combining terms with logarithms that have oppositely signed coefficients, as seen in the code snippet from `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` (Lines: 1058 to 1079).\n- If the issue persists, consider adding a special case in the `logcombine` function to handle the subtraction of logarithms directly, ensuring that `log(a) - log(b)` simplifies to `log(a/b)` when appropriate.\n- Test the `logcombine` function with the expression `log(3) - log(2)` to confirm that it now simplifies to `log(3/2)`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy) \u2192 [simplify](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/simplify)- [Lines 940 - 940](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/simplify/simplify.py#L940-L940)\n\n This is the definition of the logcombine function, which is directly related to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1058 - 1079](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/simplify/simplify.py#L1058-L1079)\n\n This snippet contains the implementation details of the logcombine function, which is where the bug likely resides. \n\n\n   - [Lines 41 - 2063](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/simplify/simplify.py#L41-L2063)\n\n This snippet provides the documentation for the logcombine function, which includes examples of expected behavior that are relevant to the issue.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy) \u2192 [simplify](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/simplify)- [Lines 680 - 695](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/simplify/powsimp.py#L680-L695)\n\n This snippet shows another part of the code where logcombine is used, which might be relevant for understanding how logcombine is expected to work in different contexts.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy) \u2192 [solvers](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/solvers) \u2192 [ode](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/tree//sympy/solvers/ode)- [Lines 1197 - 8043](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.1/blob//sympy/solvers/ode/ode.py#L1197-L8043)\n\n This snippet shows usage of logcombine in the context of solving ordinary differential equations, which might be affected by changes to the logcombine function.",
