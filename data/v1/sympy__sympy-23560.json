But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- Replace the use of `dsolve` with `_solve_linear` in the `sympy/solvers/pde.py` file where the PDE reduces to a linear ODE in `x` or `y`.\n- Ensure that `_solve_linear` is used in a way that is consistent with its expected input and output format.\n- Optimize the `_solve_linear` function if necessary to improve performance when solving for `dxdy`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy) \u2192 [solvers](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy/solvers) \u2192 [ode](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy/solvers/ode)- [Lines 276 - 695](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/blob//sympy/solvers/ode/single.py#L276-L695)\n\n This snippet defines the 'almost_linear' method which is relevant to solving linear differential equations and could be adapted or used as a reference for implementing a solution using 'solve_linear' or a low-level linear solver as suggested in the issue.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy) \u2192 [solvers](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy/solvers)- [Lines 769 - 807](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/blob//sympy/solvers/pde.py#L769-L807)\n\n This snippet deals with solving linear ODEs in the context of PDEs and could provide insight into how to handle linear cases, which is relevant to the issue of using a more efficient method for solving linear equations.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy) \u2192 [solvers](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy/solvers) \u2192 [ode](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy/solvers/ode)- [Lines 629 - 6482](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/blob//sympy/solvers/ode/ode.py#L629-L6482)\n\n This snippet includes logic for converting non-exact differential equations into exact ones, which may be relevant if the issue requires understanding or modifying the process of solving differential equations in Sympy. \n\n\n   - [Lines 3093 - 8043](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/blob//sympy/solvers/ode/ode.py#L3093-L8043)\n\n This snippet is part of the ODE module and shows the solution of a linear ODE, which might be relevant for understanding how the 'solve_linear' function could be integrated or used in the context of the 'idiff' function.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy) \u2192 [integrals](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/tree//sympy/integrals)- [Lines 701 - 786](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.11/blob//sympy/integrals/integrals.py#L701-L786)\n\n This snippet discusses differentiation under the integral sign, which might be relevant if the issue requires understanding or modifying the integration process in the context of solving differential equations."
