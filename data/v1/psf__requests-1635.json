    "mayil_response": "- The issue is related to cookies not being persisted on redirects within a `Session`.\n- The `KeyError` occurs when trying to access the `'Cookie'` header in the request headers, which suggests that the cookie header is not being set correctly after a redirect.\n- The relevant code handling redirects and cookie persistence is found in `requests/sessions.py`.\n\nTo resolve the issue:\n- Ensure that the `Cookie` header is correctly set in the `prepared_request` headers after a redirect.\n- Modify the `extract_cookies_to_jar` function call to use the correct request object that contains the updated headers.\n- Ensure that the `Cookie` header is not being incorrectly removed or overwritten during the redirect handling process.\n\nHere is a potential solution:\n- In `requests/sessions.py`, locate the block of code that handles redirection.\n- After the `extract_cookies_to_jar(prepared_request._cookies, req, resp.raw)` call, ensure that the `Cookie` header is being correctly set in the `prepared_request` object.\n- If the `Cookie` header is being removed or not set, update the code to correctly include the `Cookie` header based on the cookies stored in `prepared_request._cookies`.\n- The `extract_cookies_to_jar` function should be called with the correct request object that has the updated headers, which might be `prepared_request` instead of `req`.\n- Ensure that the `Cookie` header is preserved when the `prepared_request` object is updated with the new URL and method during the redirect process.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/tree//requests)- [Lines 178 - 245](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/sessions.py#L178-L245)\n\n This snippet includes the logic for handling redirects and cookie extraction, which is directly related to the issue of cookies not being persisted on redirects. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 103](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/sessions.py#L1-L103)\n\n This snippet contains the merge_setting function which might be involved in merging session settings and request settings, including cookies.\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/tree//requests)- [Lines 103 - 548](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/cookies.py#L103-L548)\n\n This snippet defines functions related to cookie handling, such as extract_cookies_to_jar, which could be relevant to the issue if cookies are not being correctly extracted or set. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1 - 100](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/cookies.py#L1-L100)\n\n This snippet includes the MockRequest class which is used to wrap a requests.Request object for cookie handling, and could be part of the issue if cookies are not being correctly handled.",

The RESPONSE also provides a potential solution, including steps to locate and modify the relevant code in `requests/sessions.py`. Additionally, it points to specific code snippets that could be related to the issue, which is helpful for debugging.
