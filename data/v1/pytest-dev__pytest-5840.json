Additionally, it addresses the potential operating system-specific nature of the problem by mentioning compatibility with the file system's case sensitivity. The inclusion of a code snippet to check is a valuable addition, as it directs the user to a specific part of the code that could be responsible for the import mechanism issues. However, the RESPONSE does not directly address the fact that the issue started after upgrading to pytest 5.1.2, nor does it provide a specific solution to the lowercasing of the path, which is a central point of the PROMPT.
