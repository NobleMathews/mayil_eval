The RESPONSE also includes references to the relevant code snippets in the Sympy repository, which is helpful for locating the parts of the code that need to be modified. However, the RESPONSE does not address the fact that the TypeError is raised because the sum function is not overridden and does not handle the addition of a zero vector correctly. Instead, it focuses on modifying the Vector class to handle zero as a special case. While this is a valid approach, it might not be the only or the most efficient solution, as overriding the sum function or ensuring that the zero vector is an instance of the Vector class could also resolve the issue.
