    "title": "squashmigrations optimizer crashes when fields' names are swapped using a temporary name",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nIf you rename fields using a pattern like a->c; b->a; c->b (such as if previously DateTimeFields using auto_now and auto_now_add had been mixed-up) and then attempt to squashmigrations with an optimization barrier between the CreateModel and RenameFields, the migration optimizer will attempt to create a CreateModel operation object with two fields using the same name and fail. I'll attach a migration file that triggers the failure.\nI believe the root cause of this issue is that django.db.migrations.operations.fields.RenameField allows itself to optimize through (i.e be moved to the right of, I may have gotten this terminology wrong) other RenameField operations that reference old_name.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Review the `RenameField` optimization logic in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` and ensure that it correctly handles the case where fields are renamed in a circular pattern (a->c; b->a; c->b).\n- Modify the `MigrationOptimizer` class in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py` to handle the optimization barrier correctly, ensuring that it does not attempt to optimize across the barrier when squashing migrations.\n- Ensure that the `RenameField` operation's `optimize_through` method in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` correctly updates field references in `unique_together` and `index_together` options after a rename.\n- In `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py`, verify that the logic for detecting field renames (`self.renamed_operations.append(...)`) correctly handles the case where multiple fields are renamed in a way that could lead to conflicts.\n- Add a check in the `MigrationOptimizer` to prevent the creation of a `CreateModel` operation with duplicate field names as a result of field renames.\n- If necessary, introduce an intermediate state in the migration squashing process that reflects the correct field names after each individual `RenameField` operation, before proceeding to the next operation.\n- Ensure that the `squashmigrations` command in `django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py` correctly applies the `MigrationOptimizer` and respects the optimization barrier when creating the new squashed migration.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 135 - 267](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/core/management/commands/squashmigrations.py#L135-L267)\n\n This snippet is from the squashmigrations command and shows where the optimization process is called, which is relevant to the issue of the optimizer crashing.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations) \u2192 [operations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/tree//django/db/migrations/operations)- [Lines 279 - 370](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.0/blob//django/db/migrations/operations/models.py#L279-L370)\n\n This snippet is from the CreateModel operation, which is mentioned in the issue as failing when two fields use the same name.

It suggests reviewing and modifying the optimization logic of the `RenameField` operation and the `MigrationOptimizer` class to handle circular renaming patterns and optimization barriers. It also recommends ensuring that field references in `unique_together` and `index_together` are updated after renames, and that the logic for detecting field renames in `autodetector.py` is verified. Additionally, it advises adding a check to prevent the creation of a `CreateModel` operation with duplicate field names and considering an intermediate state in the migration squashing process. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to ensure that the `squashmigrations` command applies the `MigrationOptimizer` respecting the optimization barrier. The provided code snippets are relevant and can guide the developer to the specific parts of the codebase that need attention.
