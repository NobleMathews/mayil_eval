It should not attempt to evaluate the truth value of the array directly.\n- Modify the representation method to check if `Cs` is an array and handle it appropriately, possibly by converting it to a list or using a string representation that does not require evaluating its truth value.\n- If the `Cs` parameter is being compared to its default value to determine if it has been changed, make sure the comparison is done in a way that is compatible with numpy arrays (e.g., using `np.array_equal` instead of `==`).\n- Test the changes with `print_changed_only=True` and passing a numpy array to the `Cs` parameter to ensure the `ValueError` is no longer raised.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [linear_model](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/linear_model)- [Lines 1435 - 1642](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/linear_model/_logistic.py#L1435-L1642)\n\n This snippet defines the LogisticRegressionCV class and its parameters, which is directly related to the issue reported.

The newton-cg, sag and lbfgs solvers support only L2\n    regularization with primal formulation. The liblinear solver supports both\n    L1 and L2 regularization, with a dual formulation only for the L2 penalty.\n    Elastic-Net penalty is only supported by the saga solver.\n\n    For the grid of `Cs` values and `l1_ratios` values, the best hyperparameter\n    is selected by the cross-validator\n    :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold`, but it can be changed\n    using the :term:`cv` parameter. The 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and 'lbfgs'\n    solvers can warm-start the coefficients (see :term:`Glossary<warm_start>`).\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <logistic_regression>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    Cs : int or list of floats, default=10\n        Each of the values in Cs describes the inverse of regularization\n        strength. If Cs is as an int, then a grid of Cs values are chosen\n        in a logarithmic scale between 1e-4 and 1e4.\n        Like in support vector machines, smaller values specify stronger\n        regularization.\n\n    fit_intercept : bool, default=True\n        Specifies if a constant (a.k.a. bias or intercept) should be\n        added to the decision function.\n\n    cv : int or cross-validation generator, default=None\n        The default cross-validation generator used is Stratified K-Folds.\n        If an integer is provided, then it is the number of folds used.\n        See the module :mod:`sklearn.model_selection` module for the\n        list of possible cross-validation objects.\n\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n            ``cv`` default value if None changed from 3-fold to 5-fold.\n\n    dual : bool, default=False\n        Dual or primal formulation. Dual formulation is only implemented for\n        l2 penalty with liblinear solver. Prefer dual=False when\n        n_samples > n_features.\n\n    penalty : {'l1', 'l2', 'elasticnet'}, default='l2'\n        Specify the norm of the penalty:\n\n        - `'l2'`: add a L2 penalty term (used by default);\n        - `'l1'`: add a L1 penalty term;\n        - `'elasticnet'`: both L1 and L2 penalty terms are added.\n\n        .. warning::\n           Some penalties may not work with some solvers. See the parameter\n           `solver` below, to know the compatibility between the penalty and\n           solver.\n\n    scoring : str or callable, default=None\n        A string (see model evaluation documentation) or\n        a scorer callable object / function with signature\n        ``scorer(estimator, X, y)``. For a list of scoring functions\n        that can be used, look at :mod:`sklearn.metrics`. The\n        default scoring option used is 'accuracy'.\n\n    solver : {'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'newton-cholesky', 'sag', 'saga'}, \\\n            default='lbfgs'\n\n        Algorithm to use in the optimization problem. Default is 'lbfgs'.\n        To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:\n\n            - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'\n              and 'saga' are faster for large ones;\n            - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and\n              'lbfgs' handle multinomial loss;\n            - 'liblinear' might be slower in :class:`LogisticRegressionCV`\n              because it does not handle warm-starting. 'liblinear' is\n              limited to one-versus-rest schemes.\n            - 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for `n_samples` >> `n_features`,\n              especially with one-hot encoded categorical features with rare\n              categories. Note that it is limited to binary classification and the\n              one-versus-rest reduction for multiclass classification. Be aware that\n              the memory usage of this solver has a quadratic dependency on\n              `n_features` because it explicitly computes the Hessian matrix.\n\n        .. warning::\n           The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen.\n           Supported penalties by solver:\n\n           - 'lbfgs'           -   ['l2']\n           - 'liblinear'       -   ['l1', 'l2']\n           - 'newton-cg'       -   ['l2']\n           - 'newton-cholesky' -   ['l2']\n           - 'sag'             -   ['l2']\n           - 'saga'            -   ['elasticnet', 'l1', 'l2']\n\n        .. note::\n           'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features\n           with approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with\n           a scaler from :mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.17\n           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver.\n        .. versionadded:: 0.19\n           SAGA solver.\n        .. versionadded:: 1.2\n           newton-cholesky solver.\n\n    tol : float, default=1e-4\n        Tolerance for stopping criteria.\n\n    max_iter : int, default=100\n        Maximum number of iterations of the optimization algorithm.\n\n    class_weight : dict or 'balanced', default=None\n        Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.\n        If not given, all classes are supposed to have weight one.\n\n        The \"balanced\" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust\n        weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data\n        as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``.\n\n        Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed\n        through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.17\n           class_weight == 'balanced'\n\n    n_jobs : int, default=None\n        Number of CPU cores used during the cross-validation loop.\n        ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.\n        ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    verbose : int, default=0\n        For the 'liblinear', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers set verbose to any\n        positive number for verbosity.\n\n    refit : bool, default=True\n        If set to True, the scores are averaged across all folds, and the\n        coefs and the C that corresponds to the best score is taken, and a\n        final refit is done using these parameters.\n        Otherwise the coefs, intercepts and C that correspond to the\n        best scores across folds are averaged.\n\n    intercept_scaling : float, default=1\n        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used\n        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes\n        [x, self.intercept_scaling],\n        i.e. a \"synthetic\" feature with constant value equal to\n        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.\n        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.\n\n        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization\n        as all other features.\n        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight\n        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.\n\n    multi_class : {'auto, 'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default='auto'\n        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each\n        label. For 'multinomial' the loss minimised is the multinomial loss fit\n        across the entire probability distribution, *even when the data is\n        binary*. 'multinomial' is unavailable when solver='liblinear'.\n        'auto' selects 'ovr' if the data is binary, or if solver='liblinear',\n        and otherwise selects 'multinomial'.\n\n        .. versionadded:: 0.18\n           Stochastic Average Gradient descent solver for 'multinomial' case.\n        .. versionchanged:: 0.22\n            Default changed from 'ovr' to 'auto' in 0.22.\n\n    random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None\n        Used when `solver='sag'`, 'saga' or 'liblinear' to shuffle the data.\n        Note that this only applies to the solver and not the cross-validation\n        generator. See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.\n\n    l1_ratios : list of float, default=None\n        The list of Elastic-Net mixing parameter, with ``0 <= l1_ratio <= 1``.\n        Only used if ``penalty='elasticnet'``. A value of 0 is equivalent to\n        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using\n        ``penalty='l1'``. For ``0 < l1_ratio <1``, the penalty is a combination\n        of L1 and L2.\n\n    Attributes\n    ----------\n    classes_ : ndarray of shape (n_classes, )\n        A list of class labels known to the classifier.\n\n    coef_ : ndarray of shape (1, n_features) or (n_classes, n_features)\n        Coefficient of the features in the decision function.\n\n        `coef_` is of shape (1, n_features) when the given problem\n        is binary.\n\n    intercept_ : ndarray of shape (1,) or (n_classes,)\n        Intercept (a.k.a. bias) added to the decision function.\n\n        If `fit_intercept` is set to False, the intercept is set to zero.\n        `intercept_` is of shape(1,) when the problem is binary.\n\n    Cs_ : ndarray of shape (n_cs)\n        Array of C i.e. inverse of regularization parameter values used\n        for cross-validation.\n\n    l1_ratios_ : ndarray of shape (n_l1_ratios)\n        Array of l1_ratios used for cross-validation. If no l1_ratio is used\n        (i.e. penalty is not 'elasticnet'), this is set to ``[None]``\n\n    coefs_paths_ : ndarray of shape (n_folds, n_cs, n_features) or \\",

We can see\nthat large values of C give more freedom to the model.  Conversely, smaller\nvalues of C constrain the model more. In the L1 penalty case, this leads to\nsparser solutions. As expected, the Elastic-Net penalty sparsity is between\nthat of L1 and L2.\n\nWe classify 8x8 images of digits into two classes: 0-4 against 5-9.\nThe visualization shows coefficients of the models for varying C.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Authors: Alexandre Gramfort <alexandre.gramfort@inria.fr>\n#          Mathieu Blondel <mathieu@mblondel.org>\n#          Andreas Mueller <amueller@ais.uni-bonn.de>\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\nX, y = datasets.load_digits(return_X_y=True)\n\nX = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)\n\n# classify small against large digits\ny = (y > 4).astype(int)\n\nl1_ratio = 0.5  # L1 weight in the Elastic-Net regularization\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 3)\n\n# Set regularization parameter",

Default is 'lbfgs'.\n        To choose a solver, you might want to consider the following aspects:\n\n            - For small datasets, 'liblinear' is a good choice, whereas 'sag'\n              and 'saga' are faster for large ones;\n            - For multiclass problems, only 'newton-cg', 'sag', 'saga' and\n              'lbfgs' handle multinomial loss;\n            - 'liblinear' might be slower in :class:`LogisticRegressionCV`\n              because it does not handle warm-starting. 'liblinear' is\n              limited to one-versus-rest schemes.\n            - 'newton-cholesky' is a good choice for `n_samples` >> `n_features`,\n              especially with one-hot encoded categorical features with rare\n              categories. Note that it is limited to binary classification and the\n              one-versus-rest reduction for multiclass classification. Be aware that\n              the memory usage of this solver has a quadratic dependency on\n              `n_features` because it explicitly computes the Hessian matrix.\n\n        .. warning::\n           The choice of the algorithm depends on the penalty chosen.\n           Supported penalties by solver:\n\n           - 'lbfgs'           -   ['l2']\n           - 'liblinear'       -   ['l1', 'l2']\n           - 'newton-cg'       -   ['l2']\n           - 'newton-cholesky' -   ['l2']\n           - 'sag'             -   ['l2']\n           - 'saga'            -   ['elasticnet', 'l1', 'l2']\n\n        .. note::\n           'sag' and 'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features\n           with approximately the same scale.

See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`\n        for more details.\n\n    verbose : int, default=0\n        For the 'liblinear', 'sag' and 'lbfgs' solvers set verbose to any\n        positive number for verbosity.\n\n    refit : bool, default=True\n        If set to True, the scores are averaged across all folds, and the\n        coefs and the C that corresponds to the best score is taken, and a\n        final refit is done using these parameters.\n        Otherwise the coefs, intercepts and C that correspond to the\n        best scores across folds are averaged.\n\n    intercept_scaling : float, default=1\n        Useful only when the solver 'liblinear' is used\n        and self.fit_intercept is set to True. In this case, x becomes\n        [x, self.intercept_scaling],\n        i.e. a \"synthetic\" feature with constant value equal to\n        intercept_scaling is appended to the instance vector.\n        The intercept becomes ``intercept_scaling * synthetic_feature_weight``.\n\n        Note! the synthetic feature weight is subject to l1/l2 regularization\n        as all other features.\n        To lessen the effect of regularization on synthetic feature weight\n        (and therefore on the intercept) intercept_scaling has to be increased.\n\n    multi_class : {'auto, 'ovr', 'multinomial'}, default='auto'\n        If the option chosen is 'ovr', then a binary problem is fit for each\n        label.

A value of 0 is equivalent to\n        using ``penalty='l2'``, while 1 is equivalent to using\n        ``penalty='l1'``.
