But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- The error message `django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: column reference \"status\" is ambiguous` suggests that the \"status\" column is present in more than one table involved in the query, and Django is unable to determine which one to use.\n- To resolve the ambiguity, you should specify the table alias along with the column name in the query where the \"status\" column is referenced.\n- Modify the annotation in the query that is causing the issue to use the table alias for the \"status\" column. For example, if \"status\" is a column in the \"AB\" model, you should change `.annotate(status=Subquery(ab_query.values(\"status\")))` to `.annotate(status=Subquery(ab_query.values(\"ab__status\")))`, where \"ab\" is the related name or table alias for the \"AB\" model.\n- Ensure that all occurrences of the \"status\" column in the query are prefixed with the correct table alias to avoid ambiguity.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 79 - 154](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L79-L154)\n\n This snippet discusses the logic behind the GROUP BY clause in Django's SQL compiler, which is directly related to the issue of the ambiguous 'status' column reference in the GROUP BY clause. \n\n\n   - [Lines 867 - 881](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/compiler.py#L867-L881)\n\n This snippet contains the actual code that appends the GROUP BY clause to the SQL query, which is relevant to the issue since the error is in the GROUP BY clause.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 467 - 508](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L467-L508)\n\n This snippet deals with the creation of an AggregateQuery and the handling of group_by, which is relevant to the issue as it may contain logic that leads to the ambiguous column reference. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2234 - 2281](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L2234-L2281)\n\n This snippet contains the set_group_by method, which is responsible for expanding the GROUP BY clause required by the query.
