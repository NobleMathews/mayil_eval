But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\nTo address the `IndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 1 with size 1` issue when using `GridSearchCV` with `GMM` and `scoring='roc_auc'`, consider the following solution:\n\n- Ensure that the `GMM` model is being used for clustering, not classification. The ROC AUC score is not applicable to clustering models directly as they do not provide class probabilities for a binary or multiclass classification problem.\n- If you are trying to use `GMM` as a classifier, you need to implement a custom scoring function that handles the output of `GMM` and computes a score that can be interpreted as a classification score.\n- If `GMM` is mistakenly being used as a classifier, consider switching to a classification algorithm that is compatible with ROC AUC scoring, such as `LogisticRegression`, `SVC` with `probability=True`, or any other classifier that provides a `predict_proba` method.\n- If you must use `GMM` for some form of classification, you might need to convert the clustering output to class probabilities or labels and then compute the ROC AUC score manually outside of `GridSearchCV`.\n- If the dataset indeed has only one class or the model predicts only one class, ROC AUC scoring is not meaningful. Ensure that the dataset contains at least two classes and that the model is capable of predicting multiple classes.\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement a custom scorer for a `GMM` used as a classifier, assuming that you have a strategy to convert `GMM` clustering output to class probabilities:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, make_scorer\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n\ndef gmm_scoring_function(estimator, X, y_true):\n    # Assuming `estimator` is a fitted GMM object\n    # and you have a way to convert GMM clustering output to class probabilities\n    y_proba = convert_gmm_output_to_proba(estimator, X)\n    return roc_auc_score(y_true, y_proba)\n\n# Create a custom scorer\ngmm_scorer = make_scorer(gmm_scoring_function, needs_proba=True)\n\n# Define the parameter grid\nparam_grid = {\n    'n_components': [1, 2, 3],\n    'covariance_type': ['full', 'tied', 'diag', 'spherical']\n}\n\n# Initialize the GMM\ngmm_model = GaussianMixture()\n\n# Initialize GridSearchCV with the custom scorer\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=gmm_model, param_grid=param_grid, scoring=gmm_scorer)\n\n# Fit the GridSearchCV object to the data\ngrid_search.fit(X, y)\n```\n\nRemember to replace `convert_gmm_output_to_proba` with your actual conversion function that takes the output of the `GMM` and returns class probabilities.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [utils](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/utils)- [Lines 181 - 4639](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py#L181-L4639)\n\n This snippet contains checks for classifiers with one label, which is directly related to the issue of ensuring that a classifier is not used with a dataset that has only one class. \n\n\n   - [Lines 181 - 2203](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/utils/estimator_checks.py#L181-L2203)\n\n This snippet includes checks for classifier behavior on multioutput data, which may be relevant to ensure that the classifier can handle multiclass scenarios as expected.\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [model_selection](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/tree//sklearn/model_selection)- [Lines 900 - 908](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.21/blob//sklearn/model_selection/_search.py#L900-L908)\n\n This snippet is from the _search.py file and deals with multimetric evaluation in GridSearchCV, which is relevant to the issue since the error occurs when using GridSearchCV with a scoring parameter.",

This means that the top left corner of the\nplot is the \"ideal\" point - a FPR of zero, and a TPR of one. This is not very\nrealistic, but it does mean that a larger area under the curve (AUC) is usually\nbetter. The \"steepness\" of ROC curves is also important, since it is ideal to\nmaximize the TPR while minimizing the FPR.\n\nROC curves are typically used in binary classification, where the TPR and FPR\ncan be defined unambiguously. In the case of multiclass classification, a notion\nof TPR or FPR is obtained only after binarizing the output. This can be done in\n2 different ways:\n\n- the One-vs-Rest scheme compares each class against all the others (assumed as\n  one);\n- the One-vs-One scheme compares every unique pairwise combination of classes.\n\nIn this example we explore both schemes and demo the concepts of micro and macro\naveraging as different ways of summarizing the information of the multiclass ROC\ncurves.\n\n.. note::\n\n    See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_roc_crossval.py` for\n    an extension of the present example estimating the variance of the ROC\n    curves and their respective AUC.\n\"\"\"\n\n# %%\n# Load and prepare data\n# =====================\n#\n# We import the :ref:`iris_dataset` which contains 3 classes, each one\n# corresponding to a type of iris plant.
