    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Daniel Schaffer)\n\t \nWhen using the Coalesce function as part of the condition of a FilteredRelation, the query fails with an \"Unknown column\" error if any of the fields referenced by Coalesce requires a JOIN. This appears to be due to the JOIN not actually getting added to the query.\n\t\t\tjob_worker_preference=FilteredRelation(\n\t\t\t\trelation_name=\"company__worker_preferences\",\n\t\t\t\tcondition=Q(\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany__worker_preferences__worker=Coalesce(F(\"worker\"), F(\"worker_substitutions__worker\")),\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany__worker_preferences__company=F(\"company\"),\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tis_allowed=Case(When(job_worker_preference__allow_assignments=True, then=1), default=0, output_field=BooleanField())\nThis can be worked around by creating a separate annotation for the result of the Coalesce function:\n\t\t\tactual_worker=Coalesce(F(\"worker\"), F(\"worker_substitutions__worker\")),\n\t\t\tjob_worker_preference=FilteredRelation(\n\t\t\t\trelation_name=\"company__worker_preferences\",\n\t\t\t\tcondition=Q(\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany__worker_preferences__worker=F(\"actual_worker\"),\n\t\t\t\t\tcompany__worker_preferences__company=F(\"company\"),\n\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t),\n\t\t\tis_allowed=Case(When(job_worker_preference__allow_assignments=True, then=1), default=0, output_field=BooleanField())\nHowever, I suspect there may be an underlying issue with how JOINs are detected and added to a query when there are nested field references like this.\nI've reproduced the issue in this repro: \u200bhttps://github.com/DanielSchaffer/django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro.\ndjango_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro/test/test_job_manager.py contains a failing test that reproduces the issue, and a passing test that demonstrates the workaround.\nHere's the stringified representation of the query - note the missing JOIN to django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_workersubstitution, even though it's referenced in the COALESCE expression:\nSELECT\n `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`.`id`,\n `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`.`company_id`,\n `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`.`worker_id`,\n CASE WHEN job_worker_preference.`allow_assignments` THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS `is_allowed`\nFROM `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`\nINNER JOIN `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_company`\nON (`django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`.`company_id` = `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_company`.`id`)\nLEFT OUTER JOIN `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_workerpreference` job_worker_preference\nON (`django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_company`.`id` = job_worker_preference.`company_id` AND\n\t((job_worker_preference.`company_id` = `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`.`company_id` AND\n\t job_worker_preference.`worker_id` = COALESCE(`django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_job`.`worker_id`,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro_workersubstitution`.`worker_id`))))\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the use of `FilteredRelation` with `Coalesce` in a condition that requires a JOIN, but the JOIN is not being added to the generated SQL query. This results in an \"Unknown column\" error because the column from the related table is not available in the query.\n\nTo resolve the issue, ensure that the JOIN is correctly added when `FilteredRelation` is used with `Coalesce`. Here is a potential solution:\n\n- Modify the `resolve_expression` method in the `FilteredRelation` class to ensure that the JOIN is added when necessary. This method is responsible for resolving the condition into an SQL expression that can be included in the query.\n- In the `resolve_expression` method, check if the `condition` contains a `Coalesce` function that references fields from a related model.\n- If such a `Coalesce` function is found, ensure that the necessary JOINs are added to the query to make the related fields available.\n- This might involve modifying the `build_filter` method call within `resolve_expression` to correctly handle the `Coalesce` function and its arguments.\n- Ensure that the `allow_joins` parameter is set to `True` when resolving the `Coalesce` function within the `FilteredRelation` condition.\n- After making the necessary changes, test the solution using the reproduction steps and tests available at the GitHub repository `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro/test/test_job_manager.py`.\n\nHere is a code snippet that might be modified:\n\n```python\nclass FilteredRelation:\n    # ...\n\n    def resolve_expression(self, query, reuse, *args, **kwargs):\n        clone = self.clone()\n        clone.resolved_condition = query.build_filter(\n            self.condition,\n            can_reuse=reuse,\n            allow_joins=True,  # Ensure joins are allowed\n            split_subq=False,\n            update_join_types=False,\n        )[0]\n        return clone\n```\n\nMake sure to test the changes thoroughly to confirm that the JOIN is added correctly and that the \"Unknown column\" error is resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 396 - 446](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/query_utils.py#L396-L446)\n\n This snippet defines the FilteredRelation class and its resolve_expression method, which is likely where the JOIN logic needs to be adjusted to handle the Coalesce function properly.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 1614 - 1648](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1614-L1648)\n\n This snippet shows the add_filtered_relation method of the Query class, which is responsible for adding filtered relations to a query. It may need to be modified to ensure that JOINs are correctly added when using Coalesce in conditions. \n\n\n   - [Lines 509 - 2560](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L509-L2560)\n\n This snippet is part of the Query class and deals with the handling of annotations and aggregations, which may be relevant since the issue involves the use of annotations with Coalesce. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1935 - 1983](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1935-L1983)\n\n This snippet includes the resolve_ref method, which resolves references to fields and annotations in a query.

This results in an \"Unknown column\" error because the column from the related table is not available in the query.\n\nTo resolve the issue, ensure that the JOIN is correctly added when `FilteredRelation` is used with `Coalesce`. Here is a potential solution:\n\n- Modify the `resolve_expression` method in the `FilteredRelation` class to ensure that the JOIN is added when necessary. This method is responsible for resolving the condition into an SQL expression that can be included in the query.\n- In the `resolve_expression` method, check if the `condition` contains a `Coalesce` function that references fields from a related model.\n- If such a `Coalesce` function is found, ensure that the necessary JOINs are added to the query to make the related fields available.\n- This might involve modifying the `build_filter` method call within `resolve_expression` to correctly handle the `Coalesce` function and its arguments.\n- Ensure that the `allow_joins` parameter is set to `True` when resolving the `Coalesce` function within the `FilteredRelation` condition.\n- After making the necessary changes, test the solution using the reproduction steps and tests available at the GitHub repository `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro/test/test_job_manager.py`.\n\nHere is a code snippet that might be modified:\n\n```python\nclass FilteredRelation:\n    # ...\n\n    def resolve_expression(self, query, reuse, *args, **kwargs):\n        clone = self.clone()\n        clone.resolved_condition = query.build_filter(\n            self.condition,\n            can_reuse=reuse,\n            allow_joins=True,  # Ensure joins are allowed\n            split_subq=False,\n            update_join_types=False,\n        )[0]\n        return clone\n```\n\nMake sure to test the changes thoroughly to confirm that the JOIN is added correctly and that the \"Unknown column\" error is resolved.",

        "result": "Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be related to the use of `FilteredRelation` with `Coalesce` in a condition that requires a JOIN, but the JOIN is not being added to the generated SQL query. This results in an \"Unknown column\" error because the column from the related table is not available in the query.\n\nTo resolve the issue, ensure that the JOIN is correctly added when `FilteredRelation` is used with `Coalesce`. Here is a potential solution:\n\n- Modify the `resolve_expression` method in the `FilteredRelation` class to ensure that the JOIN is added when necessary. This method is responsible for resolving the condition into an SQL expression that can be included in the query.\n- In the `resolve_expression` method, check if the `condition` contains a `Coalesce` function that references fields from a related model.\n- If such a `Coalesce` function is found, ensure that the necessary JOINs are added to the query to make the related fields available.\n- This might involve modifying the `build_filter` method call within `resolve_expression` to correctly handle the `Coalesce` function and its arguments.\n- Ensure that the `allow_joins` parameter is set to `True` when resolving the `Coalesce` function within the `FilteredRelation` condition.\n- After making the necessary changes, test the solution using the reproduction steps and tests available at the GitHub repository `django_filtered_relation_coalesce_repro/test/test_job_manager.py`.\n\nHere is a code snippet that might be modified:\n\n```python\nclass FilteredRelation:\n    # ...\n\n    def resolve_expression(self, query, reuse, *args, **kwargs):\n        clone = self.clone()\n        clone.resolved_condition = query.build_filter(\n            self.condition,\n            can_reuse=reuse,\n            allow_joins=True,  # Ensure joins are allowed\n            split_subq=False,\n            update_join_types=False,\n        )[0]\n        return clone\n```\n\nMake sure to test the changes thoroughly to confirm that the JOIN is added correctly and that the \"Unknown column\" error is resolved.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 396 - 446](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/query_utils.py#L396-L446)\n\n This snippet defines the FilteredRelation class and its resolve_expression method, which is likely where the JOIN logic needs to be adjusted to handle the Coalesce function properly.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 1614 - 1648](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__5.0/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L1614-L1648)\n\n This snippet shows the add_filtered_relation method of the Query class, which is responsible for adding filtered relations to a query.
