Use caching or memoization if necessary to avoid recomputing the same results.\n- If the `atoms()` method does not exist in the `Expression` class, create it with the above specifications.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 1832 - 1914](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/core/basic.py#L1832-L1914)\n\n This snippet defines the Atom class, which is directly related to the issue as it involves the behavior of atoms() method and the definition of leaf nodes.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 3768 - 3881](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/core/expr.py#L3768-L3881)\n\n This snippet includes the AtomicExpr class, which inherits from Atom and is mentioned in the issue as an example of objects that should be returned by expr.atoms().\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 557 - 557](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/core/numbers.py#L557-L557)\n\n This snippet shows the Number class inheriting from AtomicExpr, which is relevant to the issue as it is an example of a subclass of Atom.\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/tree//sympy/core)- [Lines 140 - 140](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.6/blob//sympy/core/symbol.py#L140-L140)\n\n This snippet shows the Symbol class inheriting from AtomicExpr, which is relevant to the issue as it is an example of a subclass of Atom.",
