    "title": "Can't disable bad-option-value",
    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Write code on a computer with a somewhat new pylint (2.4.3 in my example). Get a warning like `useless-object-inheritance` that I want to ignore, as I'm writing code compatible with python2 and python3.\r\n2. Disable said warning with `# pylint: disable=useless-object-inheritance`.\r\n3. Get a \"Bad option value\" when other people run their pylint version (example: 2.3.1; and by people, sometimes I mean docker instances ran from Jenkins that I would rather not rebuild or that depend on other people and I can't modify)\r\n4. Try to disable said error with a global `# pylint: disable=bad-option-value`\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n`# pylint: disable=bad-option-value` is ignored\r\n`# pylint: disable=E0012` is ignored\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nTo be able to write code that works on several versions of pylint and not having to make sure every computer in the company and every docker container has the same pylint version.\r\n\r\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Update the `is_valid_warning_or_error` function in `pylint_suppression.py` to handle version-specific warning and error codes.\n- In the `suppress_warning` function, check if the warning code is valid for the given Pylint version before suppressing it.\n- If the warning code is not valid for the Pylint version, do not attempt to suppress it to avoid the \"Bad option value\" error.\n- Ensure that the `parse_pylint_directives` function in `pylint_config_parser.py` correctly parses and applies the directives based on the Pylint version.\n- Add a mechanism to handle deprecated or version-specific directives gracefully, providing a fallback or alternative directive if possible.\n- Update the `W0012` entry in `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` to reflect the correct handling of unknown option values and ensure backward compatibility with older versions of Pylint.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.14/tree//pylint) \u2192 [lint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.14/tree//pylint/lint)- [Lines 190 - 1141](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.14/blob//pylint/lint/pylinter.py#L190-L1141)\n\n This snippet contains the definition of the 'bad-option-value' and 'useless-option-value' messages, which are directly related to the issue reported. It is necessary to understand how these messages are triggered and potentially modify the behavior to allow disabling them across different pylint versions.\n-  \u2192 [pylint](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.14/tree//pylint) \u2192 [checkers](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.14/tree//pylint/checkers)- [Lines 3 - 902](https://github.com/testbed/pylint-dev__pylint__2.14/blob//pylint/checkers/typecheck.py#L3-L902)\n\n This snippet from 'typecheck.py' shows the configuration options for pylint, which may need to be reviewed to understand how options are handled and to potentially add a way to ignore the 'bad-option-value' error.",
