Beams are characterized by\n    their cross sectional profile(Second moment of area), their length\n    and their material.\n\n    .. note::\n       While solving a beam bending problem, a user should choose its\n       own sign convention and should stick to it. The results will\n       automatically follow the chosen sign convention.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n    There is a beam of length 4 meters. A constant distributed load of 6 N/m\n    is applied from half of the beam till the end. There are two simple supports\n    below the beam, one at the starting point and another at the ending point\n    of the beam. The deflection of the beam at the end is restricted.\n\n    Using the sign convention of downwards forces being positive.\n\n    >>> from sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.beam import Beam\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, Piecewise\n    >>> E, I = symbols('E, I')\n    >>> R1, R2 = symbols('R1, R2')\n    >>> b = Beam(4, E, I)\n    >>> b.apply_load(R1, 0, -1)\n    >>> b.apply_load(6, 2, 0)\n    >>> b.apply_load(R2, 4, -1)\n    >>> b.bc_deflection = [(0, 0), (4, 0)]\n    >>> b.boundary_conditions\n    {'deflection': [(0, 0), (4, 0)], 'slope': []}\n    >>> b.load\n    R1*SingularityFunction(x, 0, -1) + R2*SingularityFunction(x, 4, -1) + 6*SingularityFunction(x, 2, 0)\n    >>> b.solve_for_reaction_loads(R1, R2)\n    >>> b.load\n    -3*SingularityFunction(x, 0, -1) + 6*SingularityFunction(x, 2, 0) - 9*SingularityFunction(x, 4, -1)\n    >>> b.shear_force()\n    -3*SingularityFunction(x, 0, 0) + 6*SingularityFunction(x, 2, 1) - 9*SingularityFunction(x, 4, 0)\n    >>> b.bending_moment()\n    -3*SingularityFunction(x, 0, 1) + 3*SingularityFunction(x, 2, 2) - 9*SingularityFunction(x, 4, 1)\n    >>> b.slope()\n    (-3*SingularityFunction(x, 0, 2)/2 + SingularityFunction(x, 2, 3) - 9*SingularityFunction(x, 4, 2)/2 + 7)/(E*I)\n    >>> b.deflection()\n    (7*x - SingularityFunction(x, 0, 3)/2 + SingularityFunction(x, 2, 4)/4 - 3*SingularityFunction(x, 4, 3)/2)/(E*I)\n    >>> b.deflection().rewrite(Piecewise)\n    (7*x - Piecewise((x**3, x > 0), (0, True))/2\n         - 3*Piecewise(((x - 4)**3, x - 4 > 0), (0, True))/2\n         + Piecewise(((x - 2)**4, x - 2 > 0), (0, True))/4)/(E*I)\n    \"\"\"",

It suggests reviewing methods within the Beam class that are likely to be involved in the incorrect calculation of the reaction R, such as `apply_load`, `solve_for_reaction_loads`, `shear_force`, and `bending_moment`. The RESPONSE also correctly identifies the need to check the representation of the load equation and the integration process for higher order forces. Additionally, it provides guidance on ensuring that the calculation of R is not incorrectly tied to the beam length and suggests a workaround if the problem persists. The inclusion of specific code snippets from the Sympy library's Beam class is highly valuable, as it directs the user to the exact locations in the code that may contain the bug. The RESPONSE is comprehensive and addresses multiple aspects of the described bug, making it highly useful for debugging the issue.",
