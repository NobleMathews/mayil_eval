    "title": "gamma='scale' in SVC",
    "body": "I believe that setting `gamma='scale'` in `SVC` is not meeting its intended purpose of being invariant to the scale of `X`. Currently, `gamma` is set to `1 / (n_features * X.std())`. However, I believe it should be `1 / (n_features * X.var())`. \r\n\r\nRationale: if you scale `X` by 10 you need to scale `gamma` by 1/100, not 1/10, to achieve the same results. See the definition of the RBF kernel [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.rbf_kernel.html): the \"units\" of `gamma` are 1/x^2, not 1/x. \r\n\r\nI also tested this empirically: scaling `X` by 10 and scaling `gamma` by 1/100 gives the same result as the original, whereas scaling `X` by 10 and scaling `gamma` by 1/10 gives a different result. Here is some code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\r\n\r\nX = np.random.rand(100,10)\r\ny = np.random.choice(2,size=100)\r\n\r\nsvm = SVC(gamma=1)\r\nsvm.fit(X,y)\r\nprint(svm.decision_function(X[:5]))\r\n\r\n# scale X by 10, gamma by 1/100\r\nsvm = SVC(gamma=0.01)\r\nsvm.fit(10*X,y)\r\nprint(svm.decision_function(10*X[:5])) # prints same result\r\n\r\n# scale X by 10, gamma by 1/10\r\nsvm = SVC(gamma=0.1)\r\nsvm.fit(10*X,y)\r\nprint(svm.decision_function(10*X[:5])) # prints different result\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `gamma='scale'` will become the default setting for `gamma` in version 0.22.\r\n\r\nRelated: #8361, #10331 \n",

The ``gamma`` parameters can be seen as the inverse of the radius of\ninfluence of samples selected by the model as support vectors.\n\nThe ``C`` parameter trades off correct classification of training examples\nagainst maximization of the decision function's margin. For larger values of\n``C``, a smaller margin will be accepted if the decision function is better at\nclassifying all training points correctly. A lower ``C`` will encourage a\nlarger margin, therefore a simpler decision function, at the cost of training\naccuracy. In other words ``C`` behaves as a regularization parameter in the\nSVM.\n\nThe first plot is a visualization of the decision function for a variety of\nparameter values on a simplified classification problem involving only 2 input\nfeatures and 2 possible target classes (binary classification). Note that this\nkind of plot is not possible to do for problems with more features or target\nclasses.\n\nThe second plot is a heatmap of the classifier's cross-validation accuracy as a\nfunction of ``C`` and ``gamma``. For this example we explore a relatively large\ngrid for illustration purposes. In practice, a logarithmic grid from\n:math:`10^{-3}` to :math:`10^3` is usually sufficient. If the best parameters\nlie on the boundaries of the grid, it can be extended in that direction in a\nsubsequent search.\n\nNote that the heat map plot has a special colorbar with a midpoint value close\nto the score values of the best performing models so as to make it easy to tell\nthem apart in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe behavior of the model is very sensitive to the ``gamma`` parameter. If\n``gamma`` is too large, the radius of the area of influence of the support\nvectors only includes the support vector itself and no amount of\nregularization with ``C`` will be able to prevent overfitting.\n\nWhen ``gamma`` is very small, the model is too constrained and cannot capture\nthe complexity or \"shape\" of the data. The region of influence of any selected\nsupport vector would include the whole training set. The resulting model will\nbehave similarly to a linear model with a set of hyperplanes that separate the\ncenters of high density of any pair of two classes.\n\nFor intermediate values, we can see on the second plot that good models can\nbe found on a diagonal of ``C`` and ``gamma``. Smooth models (lower ``gamma``\nvalues) can be made more complex by increasing the importance of classifying\neach point correctly (larger ``C`` values) hence the diagonal of good\nperforming models.\n\nFinally, one can also observe that for some intermediate values of ``gamma`` we\nget equally performing models when ``C`` becomes very large. This suggests that\nthe set of support vectors does not change anymore. The radius of the RBF\nkernel alone acts as a good structural regularizer. Increasing ``C`` further\ndoesn't help, likely because there are no more training points in violation\n(inside the margin or wrongly classified), or at least no better solution can\nbe found. Scores being equal, it may make sense to use the smaller ``C``\nvalues, since very high ``C`` values typically increase fitting time.\n\nOn the other hand, lower ``C`` values generally lead to more support vectors,\nwhich may increase prediction time. Therefore, lowering the value of ``C``\ninvolves a trade-off between fitting time and prediction time.\n\nWe should also note that small differences in scores results from the random\nsplits of the cross-validation procedure. Those spurious variations can be\nsmoothed out by increasing the number of CV iterations ``n_splits`` at the\nexpense of compute time. Increasing the value number of ``C_range`` and\n``gamma_range`` steps will increase the resolution of the hyper-parameter heat\nmap.\n\n\"\"\"",

The penalization term, however, will not\nincrease.\n\nWhen using, for example, :ref:`cross validation <cross_validation>`, to\nset the amount of regularization with `C`, there will be a\ndifferent amount of samples between the main problem and the smaller problems\nwithin the folds of the cross validation.\n\nSince our loss function is dependent on the amount of samples, the latter\nwill influence the selected value of `C`.\nThe question that arises is \"How do we optimally adjust C to\naccount for the different amount of training samples?\"\n\nIn the remainder of this example, we will investigate the effect of scaling\nthe value of the regularization parameter `C` in regards to the number of\nsamples for both L1 and L2 penalty.

It\ninvolves rescaling each feature such that it has a standard deviation of 1 and a\nmean of 0.\n\nEven if tree based models are (almost) not affected by scaling, many other\nalgorithms require features to be normalized, often for different reasons: to\nease the convergence (such as a non-penalized logistic regression), to create a\ncompletely different model fit compared to the fit with unscaled data (such as\nKNeighbors models). The latter is demoed on the first part of the present\nexample.\n\nOn the second part of the example we show how Principle Component Analysis (PCA)\nis impacted by normalization of features. To illustrate this, we compare the\nprincipal components found using :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` on unscaled\ndata with those obatined when using a\n:class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` to scale data first.\n\nIn the last part of the example we show the effect of the normalization on the\naccuracy of a model trained on PCA-reduced data.\n\n\"\"\"\n\n# Author: Tyler Lanigan <tylerlanigan@gmail.com>\n#         Sebastian Raschka <mail@sebastianraschka.com>\n#         Arturo Amor <david-arturo.amor-quiroz@inria.fr>\n# License: BSD 3 clause\n\n# %%\n# Load and prepare data\n# =====================\n#\n# The dataset used is the :ref:`wine_dataset` available at UCI.

The strength of the regularization is\n        inversely proportional to C. Must be strictly positive.

If a callable is given it is\n        used to pre-compute the kernel matrix from data matrices; that matrix\n        should be an array of shape ``(n_samples, n_samples)``.\n\n    degree : int, default=3\n        Degree of the polynomial kernel function ('poly').\n        Must be non-negative.
