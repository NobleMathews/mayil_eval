    "mayil_response": "- The issue is caused by a case sensitivity mismatch between Django's migration system and the MySQL database configuration.\n- The `--fake-initial` flag is used to mark initial migrations as applied without actually running them, but it seems to be failing due to the case sensitivity issue.\n- The `django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1050, \"Table 'city' already exists\")` error indicates that the migration system is trying to create a table that already exists, likely because it's not correctly detecting the existing table due to case sensitivity.\n\nSolution:\n- Ensure that the database configuration in Django matches the case sensitivity settings of the MySQL database.\n- If the MySQL database is set to be case-sensitive (`--lower-case-table-names=0`), then Django's migration system should also treat table and column names as case-sensitive.\n- Modify the `django/db/migrations/executor.py` file to correctly handle case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables and columns.\n- Specifically, in the `executor.py` file, adjust the logic that compares the table and column names to account for case sensitivity based on the database's settings.\n- If the database is case-insensitive, use the `.casefold()` method on both Django's and the database's table and column names before comparison.\n- If the database is case-sensitive, ensure that the comparison is made with the original case of the table and column names.\n- After making changes to the migration system, re-run the migrations without the `--fake-initial` flag to apply them correctly. If the tables and columns already exist and are in the correct state, consider using `--fake` to mark them as applied.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 356 - 410](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/executor.py#L356-L410)\n\n This snippet contains the code that performs the case-sensitive comparison when checking if a column is already present in a database, which is directly related to the issue described. \n\n\n   - [Lines 11 - 355](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/migrations/executor.py#L11-L355)\n\n This snippet includes the context for the code where the case-sensitive comparison is made and may need to be reviewed to fully understand the issue and how to implement a case-insensitive check.",

It provides actionable advice on ensuring that Django's database configuration matches the MySQL settings and suggests modifying the `executor.py` file to handle case sensitivity correctly. The RESPONSE also recommends using the `.casefold()` method for case-insensitive comparisons or maintaining the original case for case-sensitive databases. Additionally, it advises re-running the migrations without the `--fake-initial` flag or using `--fake` if appropriate. The inclusion of code snippets from the Django repository adds value by pointing to the relevant sections of code that may need to be reviewed or modified. However, the RESPONSE does not provide a step-by-step guide or specific code changes to resolve the issue, which would be necessary to score higher. It also does not address the potential impact of changing core Django files on future updates or migrations.",
