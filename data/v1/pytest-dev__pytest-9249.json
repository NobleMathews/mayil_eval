    "title": "test ids with `/`s cannot be selected with `-k`",
    "body": "By default pytest 6.2.2 parametrize does user arguments to generate IDs, but some of these ids cannot be used with `-k` option because you endup with errors like  `unexpected character \"/\"` when trying to do so.\r\n\r\nThe solution for this bug is to assure that auto-generated IDs are sanitized so they can be used with -k option.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\r\n    ('path', 'kind'),\r\n    (\r\n        (\"foo/playbook.yml\", \"playbook\"),\r\n    ),\r\n)\r\ndef test_auto_detect(path: str, kind: FileType) -> None:\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the first parameter includes a slash, and for good reasons. It is far from practical to have to add custom \"ids\" for all of these, as you can have LOTS of them.\r\n\r\nThere is another annoyance related to the -k selecting for parameterized tests, is the fact that square braces `[]` have special meanings for some shells and in order to use it you must remember to quote the strings. It would be much easier if the display and selecting of parametrized tests would use only shell-safe format, so we can easily copy/paste a failed test in run it. For example I think that using colon would be safe and arguably even easier to read: `test_name:param1:param2`.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Implement the `sanitize_test_id` function to replace or remove special characters that are not compatible with pytest's `-k` option and shell usage.\n- Update the `pytest_generate_tests` hook to use the `sanitize_test_id` function when generating test IDs.\n- Ensure that the sanitization logic replaces or encodes characters such as `/` and `[]` to avoid shell and pytest parsing issues.\n- Consider using a character like `:` or a simple underscore `_` as a replacement for special characters in the test IDs.\n- Test the updated logic with parameterized tests to ensure that the `-k` option works as expected with the new sanitized IDs.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 14](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__7.0/blob//bench/manyparam.py#L1-L14)\n\n This snippet contains a parametrized test which could be affected by the issue with auto-generated IDs containing slashes.

It suggests implementing a `sanitize_test_id` function to handle the sanitization of IDs, updating the `pytest_generate_tests` hook to use this function, and ensuring that characters like `/` and `[]` are replaced or encoded. The suggestion to use a character like `:` or an underscore `_` as a replacement is practical and addresses the issue of shell compatibility. Additionally, the RESPONSE includes a recommendation to test the updated logic with parameterized tests, which is a crucial step in verifying the solution. The provided code snippets are relevant for understanding the context of the issue and how IDs are generated and used in practice. The RESPONSE does not address every single detail of the PROMPT, such as the specific implementation of the `sanitize_test_id` function or the exact changes needed in the `pytest_generate_tests` hook, which prevents it from scoring a 10.",
