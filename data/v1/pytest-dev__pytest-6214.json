    "mayil_response": "Doesn't seem like we have fully grasped all the specifics of this ticket \ud83d\ude15.                   But we've outlined some ideas that might help you get started:\n\n- Verify that the `@pytest.fixture(scope='module')` is used correctly in the fixture definitions.\n- Ensure that the `yield` statement in the fixture is followed by the teardown code, which should only execute after all the tests using the fixture have run.\n- Check that the `print` statements for setup and teardown are placed correctly before and after the `yield` in the fixture functions.\n- Confirm that the `test_1`, `test_2`, and `test_3` functions are using the fixtures `fixture1` and `fixture2` correctly.\n- If the discrepancy between `--setup-plan` and `--setup-show` outputs persists, consider reporting this as a potential bug in pytest's command-line interface handling or fixture lifecycle management.\n- If the issue is with the custom command-line options, ensure that the custom command-line option parsing in pytest is correctly implemented and does not interfere with fixture setup/teardown.\n- If the issue is with the pytest version or a plugin, try updating pytest to the latest version or disabling plugins one by one to identify if a plugin is causing the issue.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [bench](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__5.2/tree//bench)- [Lines 1 - 14](https://github.com/testbed/pytest-dev__pytest__5.2/blob//bench/manyparam.py#L1-L14)\n\n This code snippet is relevant because it contains a similar setup of fixtures with module scope, which could be used to reproduce the issue or to understand the fixture lifecycle in pytest.",

The RESPONSE suggests reporting a potential bug if the discrepancy persists, which is somewhat actionable but does not offer a direct solution or explanation for the observed behavior.
