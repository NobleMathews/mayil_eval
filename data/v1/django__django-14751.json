    "body": "Description\n\t\nCurrently, the makemigrations management command doesn't lend itself well to scripting. For example, it writes its progress output to stdout rather than stderr. Also, there doesn't appear to be a structured / programmatic way to figure out what files it has created.\nMy use case is that in my development environment, I'd like to be able to run makemigrations in a Docker container, find out what files were added (e.g. from makemigrations's output), and then copy those files from the Docker container to my development machine so they can be added to source control.\nCurrently, there doesn't seem to be an easy way to do this. One way, for example, is to manually read makemigrations's output to find out what apps were affected, and then inspect the directories yourself for the new files.\nBetter, for example, would be if makemigrations could write the paths to the created files to stdout.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature request for making the `makemigrations` command script-friendly, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `makemigrations` command to separate progress output and the paths of created migration files.\n- Ensure that progress output is written to `stderr` and the paths of created migration files are written to `stdout`.\n- Add a command-line option to enable this script-friendly mode.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes to be made in `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`:\n\n- Add a new command-line option `--scriptable` to the `add_arguments` method if it's not already present.\n- In the `handle` method, check if the `--scriptable` option is set and adjust the output streams accordingly.\n- When the `--scriptable` option is enabled, write the paths of the created migration files to `stdout` and all other output to `stderr`.\n- Ensure that the `written_files` list is populated with the paths of the created migration files.\n- At the end of the `handle` method, if `--scriptable` is enabled, iterate over `self.written_files` and print each path to `stdout`.\n\nHere's a code snippet to illustrate the changes:\n\n```python\n# In the add_arguments method\nparser.add_argument(\n    \"--scriptable\",\n    action=\"store_true\",\n    dest=\"scriptable\",\n    help=(\n        \"Divert log output and input prompts to stderr, writing only \"\n        \"paths of generated migration files to stdout.\"\n    ),\n)\n\n# In the handle method\nif self.scriptable:\n    self.stderr = self.stdout\n    self.stdout = sys.stdout\n\n# At the end of the handle method\nif self.scriptable:\n    for file_path in self.written_files:\n        self.stdout.write(file_path + '\\n')\n```\n\nRemember to handle the case where no migrations are created (i.e., `self.written_files` is empty) appropriately, perhaps by printing a specific message or nothing at all, depending on the desired behavior in a scripting context.\n\nThis implementation will allow users to run `makemigrations` in a script-friendly way, capturing the paths of the created migration files from `stdout` for further processing, such as copying them out of a Docker container.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 342 - 513](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L342-L513)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for writing migration progress to stdout and handling the migration files. It is directly relevant to the issue as it needs to be modified to make the command script-friendly by potentially writing to stderr and providing a structured way to output created file paths. \n\n\n   - [Lines 106 - 168](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L106-L168)\n\n This snippet includes the initialization of the 'makemigrations' command options, including the 'scriptable' option which is relevant to the issue. Changes here could ensure that the output is more script-friendly as requested in the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 27 - 102](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L27-L102)\n\n This snippet is where the 'makemigrations' command-line arguments are defined. Modifications here could introduce new arguments to make the command more script-friendly, such as an option to output file paths in a structured format.",

        "result": "To implement the feature request for making the `makemigrations` command script-friendly, you can follow these steps:\n\n- Modify the `makemigrations` command to separate progress output and the paths of created migration files.\n- Ensure that progress output is written to `stderr` and the paths of created migration files are written to `stdout`.\n- Add a command-line option to enable this script-friendly mode.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the changes to be made in `django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py`:\n\n- Add a new command-line option `--scriptable` to the `add_arguments` method if it's not already present.\n- In the `handle` method, check if the `--scriptable` option is set and adjust the output streams accordingly.\n- When the `--scriptable` option is enabled, write the paths of the created migration files to `stdout` and all other output to `stderr`.\n- Ensure that the `written_files` list is populated with the paths of the created migration files.\n- At the end of the `handle` method, if `--scriptable` is enabled, iterate over `self.written_files` and print each path to `stdout`.\n\nHere's a code snippet to illustrate the changes:\n\n```python\n# In the add_arguments method\nparser.add_argument(\n    \"--scriptable\",\n    action=\"store_true\",\n    dest=\"scriptable\",\n    help=(\n        \"Divert log output and input prompts to stderr, writing only \"\n        \"paths of generated migration files to stdout.\"\n    ),\n)\n\n# In the handle method\nif self.scriptable:\n    self.stderr = self.stdout\n    self.stdout = sys.stdout\n\n# At the end of the handle method\nif self.scriptable:\n    for file_path in self.written_files:\n        self.stdout.write(file_path + '\\n')\n```\n\nRemember to handle the case where no migrations are created (i.e., `self.written_files` is empty) appropriately, perhaps by printing a specific message or nothing at all, depending on the desired behavior in a scripting context.\n\nThis implementation will allow users to run `makemigrations` in a script-friendly way, capturing the paths of the created migration files from `stdout` for further processing, such as copying them out of a Docker container.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 342 - 513](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L342-L513)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for writing migration progress to stdout and handling the migration files. It is directly relevant to the issue as it needs to be modified to make the command script-friendly by potentially writing to stderr and providing a structured way to output created file paths. \n\n\n   - [Lines 106 - 168](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L106-L168)\n\n This snippet includes the initialization of the 'makemigrations' command options, including the 'scriptable' option which is relevant to the issue. Changes here could ensure that the output is more script-friendly as requested in the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 27 - 102](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L27-L102)\n\n This snippet is where the 'makemigrations' command-line arguments are defined. Modifications here could introduce new arguments to make the command more script-friendly, such as an option to output file paths in a structured format."
