This code generator can be extended to support\n  .pyf files for f2py.\n\n- SymPy functions are not concerned with programming-technical issues, such\n  as input, output and input-output arguments. Other examples are contiguous\n  or non-contiguous arrays, including headers of other libraries such as gsl\n  or others.\n\n- It is highly interesting to evaluate several sympy functions in one C\n  routine, eventually sharing common intermediate results with the help\n  of the cse routine. This is more than just printing.\n\n- From the programming perspective, expressions with constants should be\n  evaluated in the code generator as much as possible. This is different\n  for printing.\n\n--- Basic assumptions ---\n\n* A generic Routine data structure describes the routine that must be\n  translated into C/Fortran/... code. This data structure covers all\n  features present in one or more of the supported languages.\n\n* Descendants from the CodeGen class transform multiple Routine instances\n  into compilable code. Each derived class translates into a specific\n  language.\n\n* In many cases, one wants a simple workflow. The friendly functions in the\n  last part are a simple api on top of the Routine/CodeGen stuff. They are\n  easier to use, but are less powerful.\n\n--- Milestones ---\n\n+ First working version with scalar input arguments, generating C code,\n  tests\n+ Friendly functions that are easier to use than the rigorous\n  Routine/CodeGen workflow.\n+ Integer and Real numbers as input and output\n+ Output arguments\n+ InputOutput arguments\n+ Sort input/output arguments properly\n+ Contiguous array arguments (numpy matrices)\n+ Also generate .pyf code for f2py (in autowrap module)\n+ Isolate constants and evaluate them beforehand in double precision\n+ Fortran 90\n+ Octave/Matlab\n\n- Common Subexpression Elimination\n- User defined comments in the generated code\n- Optional extra include lines for libraries/objects that can eval special\n  functions\n- Test other C compilers and libraries: gcc, tcc, libtcc, gcc+gsl, ...\n- Contiguous array arguments (sympy matrices)\n- Non-contiguous array arguments (sympy matrices)\n- ccode must raise an error when it encounters something that can not be\n  translated into c. ccode(integrate(sin(x)/x, x)) does not make sense.\n- Complex numbers as input and output\n- A default complex datatype\n- Include extra information in the header: date, user, hostname, sha1\n  hash, ...\n- Fortran 77\n- C++\n- Python\n- Julia\n- Rust\n- ...\n\n\"\"\"",

It suggests checking out the specific commit that caused the regression, reviewing the relevant classes and methods, ensuring correct mapping and error handling, and verifying the presence and correctness of regression tests. The RESPONSE also includes direct links to the code snippets that are likely to contain the source of the regression, which is highly valuable for a developer looking to fix the issue. The only reason it does not score a 10 is that it does not explicitly mention the need to run the code generation for Octave with the `assoc_laguerre` function to confirm that it now correctly raises an error, which would be the final step in verifying the fix.",
