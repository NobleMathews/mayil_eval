    "title": "Wrong hint about recursive relationship.",
    "body": "Description\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)\n\t \nWhen there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:\nhint=(\n\t'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n\t'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\nBut 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.\nThis was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Update the error message hints in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` to correctly suggest the use of `ManyToManyField` with the `through` argument and `through_fields` when necessary.\n- Ensure that the hints do not suggest using `symmetrical=False` as an argument for `ForeignKey` since it is not a valid argument for `ForeignKey` and is only relevant for `ManyToManyField` in self-referential cases.\n- Correct the hints to provide accurate guidance for defining recursive relationships using `ManyToManyField` with the appropriate `through` model and `through_fields` tuple.\n- Modify the error message for checks with IDs \"fields.E334\" and \"fields.E335\" to include the correct hint:\n  ```python\n  hint=(\n      \"If you want to create a recursive relationship, \"\n      'use ManyToManyField(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\", through_fields=(\"field1\", \"field2\")).'\n  )\n  ```\n  Replace `\"field1\"` and `\"field2\"` with the actual field names from the intermediary model that should be used for the relationship.\n- Ensure that the `ManyToManyField` initialization in `django/db/models/fields/related.py` correctly handles the `symmetrical` argument when the `to` argument is equal to `RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT`.\n- Review the `ManyToManyField`'s `_check_unique`, `_check_relationship_model`, `_check_ignored_options`, and `_check_table_uniqueness` methods to ensure they are consistent with the expected behavior for many-to-many relationships with an intermediary model.\n- Verify that the `contribute_to_class` method in `ManyToManyField` correctly sets up the `related_name` for symmetrical self-referential fields and does not allow for an accidental clash of related names.\n- Ensure that the `ManyToManyField`'s `through` model is correctly resolved and that the `ManyToManyDescriptor` is properly set on the class.\n- Remove any incorrect suggestions or validations that imply `symmetrical=False` and `through` are valid arguments for `ForeignKey`.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [fields](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/tree//django/db/models/fields)- [Lines 1529 - 1777](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.1/blob//django/db/models/fields/related.py#L1529-L1777)\n\n This snippet contains the error message and hint that are incorrect as per the issue description. It needs to be updated to correct the hint regarding the use of 'ForeignKey' instead of 'ManyToManyField' and remove the outdated 'symmetrical=False' requirement.",
