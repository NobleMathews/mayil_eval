    "body": "Hi again, well, i'm little confuse of the conditions to take or not `oo` in some sets:\n\n``` python\n>>> Interval(-oo, oo)\n(-oo, oo)\n```\n\nFirst the means the interval is created excluding `oo` and `-oo`, and interval interpret it in that way, but now:\n\n``` python\n>>> Interval(oo, oo)\n{oo}\n```\n\nHere is a little conflict, in first place Interval show don't take `oo` but now it is there? in some way is fine to have a way to can represent the `oo` from Interval.\n\nNow from this point we have some points:\nHow they will interpret the limit concept? basically two options, limit is:\n\n``` python\n[x, oo]\n```\n\nor\n\n``` python\n[x, oo)\n```\n\n?\nThis point is very important, because define the behavior for sets, and affects directly like this issue: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11174\n\nso, for now only to match the math in all sets we can say the limit is calculated via\n\n``` python\n[x, oo)\n```\n\nnow, what is the effect of this in Sympy?, first this enable the limit concept in every unbounded set, for now i found this two issues:\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11688\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/11640\n\nfor example, actually we have this:\n\n``` python\n>>> solveset(y/x, x)\nEmptySet()\n```\n\nthis return should be something like... `nan`? because in the limit we don't know what is the proportion of `y` and `x`, so we can't calc it.\n\nactually this concept is applied in some way like:\n\n``` python\n>>> solveset(y*x, x)\n{0} \n```\n\nNow the next question, `oo` will represent the infinite, as a integer, real or what?\ni know this question don't have sense, but let me try explain it:\n\n``` python\n>>> Interval(-oo, oo) in S.Reals\nFalse\n>>> Interval(-oo, oo) in S.Naturals\n#can't be calculated for now\n```\n\nif the oo represent the infinite without form, it can exist in S.Naturals, and S.Reals, but if you represent the infinite like the interval between it, `Interval(x, oo)` where is the limit of x to infinite while always `x < oo`, in other way `Interval(A, B)` where A go to `oo` and B do to `oo`, but it need always will respect this condition `A < B` so between `A` and `B` can exist any type of numbers, so `oo` can't exist in `S.Naturals` because `Interval(A, B)` can contains a real number for example, but the extension of that concept says `oo` can't exist in any set, because always will exist a bigger set, in sympy you have an approximation of it, is `UniversalSet`, but don't will be true completely, because, why is it the limit set?, `UniversalSet` can represent two things, the limit of the actually human knowledge (or applied to Sympy), or the 'master' set, thinking its like the perfection of the sets knowledge.\nObvs, to `oo` make some sense in the actual system the option is interpret `oo` without limit or form, and take the second interpretation of `UniversalSet` (if you take the first. `oo` can't exist in any place).\nIf you disagree you always can discuss and change the behavior.\n\nObjetives of this issue:\n\nGet a clear definitions in Sympy of:\n- Infinite\n- Limit\n- UniversalSet\n\nThen, clear the behavior of this concepts in Sympy, and to finish, set the behavior in Sympy.\n\nThx. Cya.\n\n",

    "mayil_response": "The ticket raises a conceptual question about the representation and behavior of infinity (`oo`) in intervals within the SymPy library. The user is confused about how infinity is handled in different scenarios and how it affects set operations and limits.\n\nHere are the key points to address the user's concerns:\n\n- In SymPy, `Interval(-oo, oo)` represents the entire real number line, excluding infinity itself. The parentheses indicate that the endpoints are not included.\n- `Interval(oo, oo)` is a special case that represents the set containing only the point at infinity. This is an edge case in the representation of intervals.\n- The limit concept in SymPy can be represented as `[x, oo)` to indicate that the interval includes `x` and goes up to but does not include infinity.\n- The behavior of `solveset` with respect to infinity needs to be consistent with the mathematical definition of limits and should be addressed if it currently isn't.\n- Infinity (`oo`) in SymPy is not an integer, real, or any other specific type of number; it is a concept representing an unbounded quantity. It is used in extended real number systems.\n- `oo` should be considered as part of the real numbers (`S.Reals`) in SymPy, but it does not belong to the natural numbers (`S.Naturals`) because it is not a finite quantity.\n- The `UniversalSet` in SymPy is an approximation of the concept of a set that contains everything, but it does not have a strict mathematical definition within the library.\n\nObjectives for resolving the issue:\n\n- Define \"Infinite,\" \"Limit,\" and \"UniversalSet\" clearly within the context of SymPy.\n- Clarify the behavior of these concepts in SymPy.\n- Set the behavior in SymPy to be consistent with these definitions.\n\nThe provided code snippets from `sympy/sets/handlers/add.py`, `sympy/calculus/util.py`, `sympy/core/numbers.py`, `sympy/sets/handlers/power.py`, `sympy/series/order.py`, and `sympy/sets/fancysets.py` are implementations of various set operations, interval arithmetic, and handling of infinity within the SymPy library. These snippets are relevant to understanding how infinity and intervals are currently handled in the codebase.",

This is forced, since we have,\n    for example, `1/AccumBounds(0, 1) = AccumBounds(1, oo)`, and the limit at\n    `0` is not one-sided. As x tends to `0-`, then `1/x -> -oo`, so `-oo`\n    should be interpreted as belonging to `AccumBounds(1, oo)` though it need\n    not appear explicitly.\n\n    In many cases it suffices to know that the limit set is bounded.\n    However, in some other cases more exact information could be useful.\n    For example, all accumulation values of cos(x) + 1 are non-negative.\n    (AccumBounds(-1, 1) + 1 = AccumBounds(0, 2))\n\n    A AccumulationBounds object is defined to be real AccumulationBounds,\n    if its end points are finite reals.\n\n    Let `X`, `Y` be real AccumulationBounds, then their sum, difference,\n    product are defined to be the following sets:\n\n    `X + Y = \\{ x+y \\mid x \\in X \\cap y \\in Y\\}`\n\n    `X - Y = \\{ x-y \\mid x \\in X \\cap y \\in Y\\}`\n\n    `X * Y = \\{ x*y \\mid x \\in X \\cap y \\in Y\\}`\n\n    There is, however, no consensus on Interval division.\n\n    `X / Y = \\{ z \\mid \\exists x \\in X, y \\in Y \\mid y \\neq 0, z = x/y\\}`\n\n    Note: According to this definition the quotient of two AccumulationBounds\n    may not be a AccumulationBounds object but rather a union of\n    AccumulationBounds.\n\n    Note\n    ====\n\n    The main focus in the interval arithmetic is on the simplest way to\n    calculate upper and lower endpoints for the range of values of a\n    function in one or more variables.

This is equivalent to `\\lim_{x \\rightarrow a}\n    \\sup |g(x)/f(x)| < \\infty`.\n\n    Let's illustrate it on the following example by taking the expansion of\n    `\\sin(x)` about 0:\n\n    .. math ::\n        \\sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + O(x^5)\n\n    where in this case `O(x^5) = x^5/5! - x^7/7! + \\cdots`. By the definition\n    of `O`, for any `\\delta > 0` there is an `M` such that:\n\n    .. math ::\n        |x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ....| <= M|x^5| \\text{ for } |x| < \\delta\n\n    or by the alternate definition:\n\n    .. math ::\n        \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} | (x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ....) / x^5| < \\infty\n\n    which surely is true, because\n\n    .. math ::\n        \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} | (x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ....) / x^5| = 1/5!\n\n\n    As it is usually used, the order of a function can be intuitively thought\n    of representing all terms of powers greater than the one specified. For\n    example, `O(x^3)` corresponds to any terms proportional to `x^3,\n    x^4,\\ldots` and any higher power. For a polynomial, this leaves terms\n    proportional to `x^2`, `x` and constants.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import O, oo, cos, pi\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n\n    >>> O(x + x**2)\n    O(x)\n    >>> O(x + x**2, (x, 0))\n    O(x)\n    >>> O(x + x**2, (x, oo))\n    O(x**2, (x, oo))\n\n    >>> O(1 + x*y)\n    O(1, x, y)\n    >>> O(1 + x*y, (x, 0), (y, 0))\n    O(1, x, y)\n    >>> O(1 + x*y, (x, oo), (y, oo))\n    O(x*y, (x, oo), (y, oo))\n\n    >>> O(1) in O(1, x)\n    True\n    >>> O(1, x) in O(1)\n    False\n    >>> O(x) in O(1, x)\n    True\n    >>> O(x**2) in O(x)\n    True\n\n    >>> O(x)*x\n    O(x**2)\n    >>> O(x) - O(x)\n    O(x)\n    >>> O(cos(x))\n    O(1)\n    >>> O(cos(x), (x, pi/2))\n    O(x - pi/2, (x, pi/2))\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..
