    "title": "Naming an incompletely applied squashed migration as a migration target fails with bare NodeNotFoundError",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nIn Line 205-208 in django/db/migrations/loader.py replacement migrations (created with squash) are checked if they can be applied. If any of the to be replaced migrations isn't already applied the replacement migration is not added to the nodes list.\nThis leads to the fact that if some of the migrations are removed or not completely applied before the squash is added and there is a dependency on the replacement migration, the user gets a 'NodeNotFoundError' where the replacement migration that is not being applied because of line 206 is the missing one.\nThis is very confusing to the user, raising a warning in line 208 would inform the user that the squashed migration can not be applied because not all the 'child' migrations are applied. \nHad to debug into that to figure that out.\n",

    "mayil_response": "Based on the provided information, the issue is that a `NodeNotFoundError` is raised when a squashed migration is named as a migration target but some of its 'child' migrations have not been applied. To resolve this issue:\n\n- Modify the exception handling in `django/db/migrations/loader.py` to provide a clear warning message when a `NodeNotFoundError` is encountered due to unapplied 'child' migrations of a squashed migration.\n- Update the `NodeNotFoundError` exception message to include instructions or information on how to resolve the issue, such as applying the missing 'child' migrations before proceeding.\n\nHere is a potential solution:\n\n```python\n# django/db/migrations/loader.py\n\ntry:\n    self.graph.validate_consistency()\nexcept NodeNotFoundError as exc:\n    reverse_replacements = {}\n    for key, migration in self.replacements.items():\n        for replaced in migration.replaces:\n            reverse_replacements.setdefault(replaced, set()).add(key)\n    if exc.node in reverse_replacements:\n        candidates = reverse_replacements.get(exc.node, set())\n        is_replaced = any(\n            candidate in self.graph.nodes for candidate in candidates\n        )\n        if not is_replaced:\n            tries = \", \".join(\"%s.%s\" % c for c in candidates)\n            raise NodeNotFoundError(\n                \"Migration {0} depends on nonexistent node ('{1}', '{2}'). \"\n                \"Django tried to replace migration {1}.{2} with any of [{3}] \"\n                \"but wasn't able to because some of the replaced migrations \"\n                \"are not applied.

It suggests modifying the exception handling in the specified file to provide a clear warning message when a NodeNotFoundError occurs due to unapplied 'child' migrations of a squashed migration. The RESPONSE also includes a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement the proposed solution, which is directly relevant to the issue at hand. Additionally, the RESPONSE provides links to the relevant code sections in the Django repository, which could be useful for further investigation and implementation of the fix. The reason for not giving a score of 10 is that the RESPONSE does not address the suggestion from the PROMPT to raise a warning in line 208, instead, it focuses on modifying the exception message, which is a slightly different approach.",
