    "body": "Description\n\t\nCurrently, merge migrations filenames are created with a timestamp. For example:\n0003_merge_20160102_0304.py\nThis name is more opaque than necessary. When one reads it, it isn't immediately clear which migrations were merged. One must inspect the file to find that information.\nInstead, I suggest the default filename should be created by combining the files being merged. This way, it includes the information without requiring one to inspect the file. This information is also useful in the migrate command's output. As it is most likely to merge two migrations files, this should remain a reasonable length.\nFor example:\n0003_merge_0002_conflicting_second_0002_second.py\nIf preferable, we could decide to join the names in other ways too. For example, separate names by __ (two underscores) or exclude prefix numbers. To start, I'll go with the easiest approach unless there is strong preference for a different naming scheme.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the feature request to improve the default name of merge migrations, you will need to modify the logic that generates the filename for a new merge migration. This logic is found in the `makemigrations.py` file, specifically in the section where the merge migrations are handled.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of the steps to implement the feature:\n\n- Modify the `makemigrations.py` file to change the way the merge migration filename is generated.\n- Instead of using a timestamp, use the names of the migrations being merged.\n- Ensure that the resulting filename is not excessively long, as this could cause issues with filesystems that have path length limitations.\n\nHere's a more detailed implementation:\n\n1. Locate the section in `makemigrations.py` where the merge migration filename is created.\n2. Replace the logic that appends the timestamp with logic that combines the names of the migrations being merged.\n3. Ensure that the combined name is truncated or otherwise modified to prevent it from becoming too long.\n\nHere's a pseudo-code snippet to illustrate the changes:\n\n```python\n# In makemigrations.py, locate the section that generates the merge migration filename\n# ...\n\n# Replace the timestamp logic with a combination of migration names\nleaf_names = \"__\".join(  # Use double underscores as separators\n    sorted(migration.name.split(\"_\", 1)[1] for migration in merge_migrations)  # Exclude prefix numbers\n)\nif len(leaf_names) > 47:  # Check if the combined name is too long\n    leaf_names = leaf_names[:47] + \"...\"  # Truncate and append ellipsis\n\n# Continue with the existing logic to create the migration name\nparts = [\"%04i\" % (biggest_number + 1), \"merge\", leaf_names]\nmigration_name = \"_\".join(parts)\n# ...\n```\n\nThis pseudo-code snippet modifies the existing logic to create a filename that includes the names of the migrations being merged, separated by double underscores, and ensures that the filename does not exceed a reasonable length.\n\nRemember to test the changes thoroughly, including scenarios with a large number of migrations being merged, to ensure that the new naming scheme works as expected and does not introduce new issues.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [core](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core) \u2192 [management](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management) \u2192 [commands](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/core/management/commands)- [Lines 458 - 513](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py#L458-L513)\n\n This snippet contains the logic for generating merge migration filenames, which is directly related to the issue of improving the default name of merge migrations.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db) \u2192 [migrations](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db/migrations)- [Lines 200 - 222](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/migrations/migration.py#L200-L222)\n\n This snippet suggests names for migrations and may need to be reviewed or modified to ensure consistency with the new naming scheme for merge migrations.",
