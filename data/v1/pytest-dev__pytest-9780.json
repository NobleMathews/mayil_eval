From the deprecation and removal list we couldn't see which item might have caused it. \r\n\r\nOne speculation we might generate is that our `slow` mark is not registered in our `pytest.ini` file explicitly and maybe registrations are now obligatory. \r\n\r\nHere is a complete SciPy test suite example with all installation steps provided. \r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/scipy-org/SciPy/_build/results?buildId=16988&view=logs&jobId=7d84eb14-5b07-5555-8e62-838a7038a2b0&j=ede89041-5e8e-5201-ce5c-f68c2cbf02dd&t=141d9d53-a127-58b4-0262-4b9693c8e91f\r\n\r\nAnd our pytest.ini file lives here \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/main/pytest.ini\r\n\r\nThank you for all the efforts.\n",

These are actionable and relevant steps that can help in resolving the issue. The response also provides code snippets to check, which could potentially lead to identifying the problem if it is related to changes in the 'py' library or its deprecation.
