It shows how dimensions are normalized and how the distance is calculated, which is relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1076 - 1192](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/blob//sympy/geometry/point.py#L1076-L1192)\n\n This snippet is from the 'Point3D' class and includes the '__new__' method which may be involved in the creation of Point3D objects. Since the issue is with 3D points, this snippet is relevant. \n\n\n   - [Lines 178 - 286](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/blob//sympy/geometry/point.py#L178-L286)\n\n This snippet includes the '__abs__' method which calculates the distance to the origin.
