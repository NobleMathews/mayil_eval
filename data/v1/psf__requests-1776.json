    "mayil_response": "To address the issue of cookies being incorrectly persisted to the session when they should not be, you should modify the `Session` class's request handling to ensure that cookies provided in the `kwargs` of a request are not being saved to the session's cookie jar unless explicitly intended. Here's a solution:\n\n- In `requests/sessions.py`, locate the `Session` class's `request` method.\n- Within the `request` method, after cookies are processed, ensure that only cookies from the server's response are stored in the session's cookie jar.\n- Prevent any cookies passed as part of the request from being added to the session's cookie jar unless they are set in the response.\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates how to modify the `Session.request` method:\n\n```python\nclass Session:\n    # ... other parts of the Session class ...\n\n    def request(self, method, url, **kwargs):\n        # ... existing code ...\n\n        # Prepare the request, including any cookies provided in the kwargs\n        req = self.prepare_request(Request(method=method.upper(), url=url, **kwargs))\n\n        # Send the request\n        resp = self.send(req, **kwargs)\n\n        # Extract cookies from the response and store them in the session's cookie jar\n        # This should be the only place where cookies are added to the session's cookie jar\n        extract_cookies_to_jar(self.cookies, req, resp.raw)\n\n        # ... existing code ...\n\n        return resp\n```\n\nMake sure that the `extract_cookies_to_jar` function is called only with the response object, and not with the request object containing the `kwargs` cookies. This will ensure that only cookies set by the server in the response are added to the session's cookie jar, and any cookies passed in the request are used only for that specific request and not persisted in the session.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [requests](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/tree//requests)- [Lines 1 - 103](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/sessions.py#L1-L103)\n\n This snippet from 'requests/sessions.py' contains the 'merge_setting' function which might be involved in merging settings across requests, including cookies. Since the issue is related to cookies being persisted to the session, this function could be relevant for the fix. \n\n\n   - [Lines 178 - 245](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/sessions.py#L178-L245)\n\n This snippet from 'requests/sessions.py' shows the handling of redirects and the extraction of cookies to the jar. It is relevant because the issue is about cookies being incorrectly persisted, and this code is directly involved in that process. \n\n\n   - [Lines 246 - 281](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/sessions.py#L246-L281)\n\n This snippet from 'requests/sessions.py' continues from the previous snippet and includes the extraction of cookies to the session's cookie jar after a redirect. It is relevant for the same reasons as snippet #6. \n\n\n   - [Lines 283 - 332](https://github.com/testbed/psf__requests__2.0/blob//requests/sessions.py#L283-L332)\n\n This snippet from 'requests/sessions.py' includes the 'rebuild_auth' method which might be relevant if the issue involves authentication headers being affected by the cookie persistence problem.",
