    "title": "Add a 'durable' flag to transaction.atomic()",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nAs discussed \u200bon Twitter following \u200bDavid Seddon's blog post.\ntransaction.atomic() guarantees the wrapped database operations is *atomic* - at the end of its wrapped block, operations within that block will all be applied, or all rolled back. In some situations it's also useful to guarantee that the wrapped operations are *durable* - at the end of the wrapped block, all operations have definitely been committed. atomic() doesn't guarantee this at the moment since its use may be wrapped by *another* atomic() higher in the stack, delaying the commit.\nDavid Seddon's technique to guarantee durability is to wrap atomic() to first check if an atomic() is already active for the current connection (in other words, connection.get_autocommit() returns False), and raise an error if so.\nOn Twitter, Ian Foote suggested adding a durable flag to atomic() to add this behaviour to Django, to which Aymeric Augustin said it sounds like a good idea.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the requested feature, you will need to modify the `Atomic` class and the `atomic` function in the `django/db/transaction.py` file to support the `durable` flag. Here's how you can do it:\n\n- Modify the `Atomic` class's `__init__` method to accept a `durable` parameter and store it as an instance attribute.\n- In the `Atomic` class's `__enter__` method, add a check to raise a `RuntimeError` if the `durable` flag is set and the current connection is already inside an atomic block.\n- Update the `atomic` function to accept a `durable` parameter and pass it to the `Atomic` class constructor.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\n# In django/db/transaction.py\n\nclass Atomic:\n    def __init__(self, using, savepoint, durable=False):\n        # ... existing code ...\n        self.durable = durable\n        # ... existing code ...\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        connection = get_connection(self.using)\n\n        # Check for durability requirement\n        if self.durable and connection.in_atomic_block:\n            raise RuntimeError(\n                \"A durable atomic block cannot be nested within another atomic block.\"\n            )\n\n        # ... existing code ...\n\n# Modify the atomic function to accept the durable parameter\ndef atomic(using=None, savepoint=True, durable=False):\n    # ... existing code ...\n    if callable(using):\n        return Atomic(DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS, savepoint, durable)(using)\n    else:\n        return Atomic(using, savepoint, durable)\n```\n\nMake sure to add appropriate unit tests to verify that the `durable` flag behaves as expected:\n\n- When `durable=True`, a `RuntimeError` should be raised if the block is nested within another atomic block.\n- When `durable=False`, the behavior should remain unchanged.\n\nRemember to update the documentation to reflect the new `durable` parameter for the `atomic` function and the `Atomic` class.\n\nThis implementation assumes that the `durable` flag's purpose is to prevent nested atomic blocks and ensure that the database operations within the block are committed immediately upon successful completion of the block. If there are additional requirements for durability that are not covered by this implementation, those would need to be addressed separately.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/tree//django/db)- [Lines 13 - 180](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L13-L180)\n\n This snippet defines the Atomic class and its __init__ method, which is where the 'durable' flag would be added as a parameter, making it directly relevant to the issue. \n\n\n   - [Lines 182 - 222](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L182-L222)\n\n This snippet contains the __enter__ method of the Atomic class, which is where the logic to check for an existing atomic block and raise an error if the 'durable' flag is set would be implemented. \n\n\n   - [Lines 316 - 340](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__3.2/blob//django/db/transaction.py#L316-L340)\n\n This snippet defines the atomic function, which is the public API that will be modified to accept the new 'durable' flag as an argument, making it directly relevant to the issue.",

None denotes the absence of a savepoint.\n\n    This allows reentrancy even if the same AtomicWrapper is reused. For\n    example, it's possible to define `oa = atomic('other')` and use `@oa` or\n    `with oa:` multiple times.\n\n    Since database connections are thread-local, this is thread-safe.\n\n    An atomic block can be tagged as durable. In this case, raise a\n    RuntimeError if it's nested within another atomic block.
