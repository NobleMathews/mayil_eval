    "title": "clear select fields for `.exists()` of distinct, non-sliced querysets",
    "body": "Description\n\t\nThe fix (93cc6dcdac6fc3e506640fa38dd1798c3cd61cff) for bug #18414 introduced an inefficiency in .exists() on distinct querysets in that now all distinct querysets are selecting all their fields. I propose the fields should be left on the queryset only if (q.distinct and (q.high_mark is not None or q.low_mark is not None)).\nAs I started writing the test for this, I realized I would have to inspect the query itself, which seems... like a bad idea for a test. Would this be reasonable to submit the (one-line-change) patch without a test, or does someone have a suggestion for a way to make the test that's less brittle?\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Review the `exists()` method in `django/db/models/query.py` to ensure it handles `distinct` querysets efficiently.\n- Modify the `exists()` method to check for `q.distinct` and whether `q.high_mark` or `q.low_mark` is set, and adjust the query accordingly to avoid inefficiency.\n- Ensure that the `distinct` fields are not left on the queryset when `exists()` is called if `q.high_mark` or `q.low_mark` is present, as this could lead to inefficiency.\n- The one-line change could be in the `exists()` method, where you conditionally modify the queryset before checking for results based on the presence of `q.distinct` and slice marks (`q.high_mark` and `q.low_mark`).\n- Avoid making changes that would make tests brittle by inspecting the query itself; focus on the behavior of the `exists()` method.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models) \u2192 [sql](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models/sql)- [Lines 2054 - 2134](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L2054-L2134)\n\n This snippet contains the 'set_limits' method which is relevant to the issue as it deals with setting the high_mark and low_mark, which are mentioned in the issue description. \n\n\n   - [Lines 2392 - 2452](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/sql/query.py#L2392-L2452)\n\n This snippet contains the 'set_values' method which is relevant to the issue as it deals with the selection of fields, which is a core part of the problem described in the issue.\n-  \u2192 [django](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django) \u2192 [db](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db) \u2192 [models](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/tree//django/db/models)- [Lines 1673 - 2061](https://github.com/testbed/django__django__4.1/blob//django/db/models/query.py#L1673-L2061)\n\n This snippet contains the 'distinct' method which is relevant to the issue as it directly relates to the distinct querysets mentioned in the issue description.",
