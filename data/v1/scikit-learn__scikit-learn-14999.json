    "body": "(This is about the non-histogram-based version of GBDTs)\r\n\r\nX is split into train and validation data with `train_test_split(random_state=self.random_state)`.\r\n\r\nAs @johannfaouzi noted, in a warm starting context, this will produce a leak if If `self.random_state` is a `RandomState` instance: some samples that were used for training in a previous `fit` might be used for validation now.\r\n\r\n~~I think the right fix would be to raise a `ValueError` if the provided random state isn't a number and early-stopping is activated~~\n",

    "mayil_response": "- Verify that `self.random_state` is a number before using it in `train_test_split` when early stopping is enabled.\n- In the `GBDT` class, modify the `fit` method to check if `self.random_state` is an instance of `RandomState` and if `self.early_stopping` is `True`. If both conditions are met, raise a `ValueError`.\n- Ensure that `self.random_state` is set to an integer or `None` when initializing the `GBDT` class or before calling `train_test_split`.\n- If `self.random_state` is an instance of `RandomState`, extract the random seed using `self.random_state.get_state()[1][0]` and use that as the seed for `train_test_split`.\n- Update the `train_test_split` calls within the `fit` method to use the extracted random seed if `self.random_state` is not a number.\n- If warm starting is used, ensure that the random state is consistent across multiple calls to `fit`. This may involve setting the random state to a fixed number or saving and reusing the state of the random number generator.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/ensemble)- [Lines 434 - 456](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_gb.py#L434-L456)\n\n This snippet contains the train_test_split function with random_state=self.random_state, which is directly related to the issue of data leak in GBDT due to warm start.\n-  \u2192 [sklearn](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn) \u2192 [ensemble](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/ensemble) \u2192 [_hist_gradient_boosting](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/tree//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting)- [Lines 416 - 484](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting/gradient_boosting.py#L416-L484)\n\n This snippet includes the logic for early stopping and validation data creation, which is relevant to the issue since the data leak occurs when early stopping is activated and warm starting is used. \n\n\n   - [Lines 485 - 502](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting/gradient_boosting.py#L485-L502)\n\n This snippet shows the binning of validation data, which is relevant because the issue occurs when previously trained data might be used for validation in a warm start scenario. \n\n\n   - [Lines 533 - 591](https://github.com/testbed/scikit-learn__scikit-learn__0.22/blob//sklearn/ensemble/_hist_gradient_boosting/gradient_boosting.py#L533-L591)\n\n This snippet is relevant as it deals with early stopping and validation score calculations, which are part of the context where the data leak might happen.",
