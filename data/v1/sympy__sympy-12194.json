    "title": "List of prime factors including multiplicity is missing",
    "body": "The vast majority of the time when using prime factorization in algorithms I'm interested in a list of prime factors. E.g. for 24 it's `[2, 2, 2, 3]`. However sympy (to my knowledge) only provides `sympy.factorint` which returns a dictionary. I always end up writing a helper function:\r\n\r\n    factorlist = lambda fac: sum(([p] * fac[p] for p in sorted(fac)), [])\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if factorizations in this format were directly provided by sympy, either by an option to `factorint` (e.g. `sympy.factorint(24, aslist=True)`) or under a new function name entirely.\n",

    "mayil_response": "To implement the requested feature in the `sympy` library, you can modify the `factorint` function to accept an additional argument `aslist` which, when set to `True`, will return the prime factors including their multiplicities as a list. Here's a high-level overview of the steps to implement this feature:\n\n- Modify the `factorint` function signature to include the `aslist` parameter with a default value of `False`.\n- After computing the prime factors and their multiplicities, check if `aslist` is `True`.\n- If `aslist` is `True`, convert the dictionary of factors into a list by repeating each prime factor according to its multiplicity.\n- Return the list of prime factors if `aslist` is `True`; otherwise, return the dictionary as before.\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates how to implement this:\n\n```python\ndef factorint(n, limit=None, use_trial=True, use_rho=True, use_pm1=True, verbose=False, visual=False, multiple=False, aslist=False):\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    # After computing the prime factors and their multiplicities\n    factors = factorint(n, limit=limit, use_trial=use_trial, use_rho=use_rho, use_pm1=use_pm1, verbose=verbose, visual=visual, multiple=multiple)\n\n    if aslist:\n        # Convert the dictionary of factors into a list\n        factorlist = []\n        for prime, multiplicity in sorted(factors.items()):\n            factorlist.extend([prime] * multiplicity)\n        return factorlist\n    else:\n        # Return the dictionary of factors as before\n        return factors\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n```\n\nTo integrate this change into the `sympy` library, you would need to modify the `factorint` function in the `sympy/ntheory/factor_.py` file. Make sure to update the function's docstring to document the new parameter and to add tests to the `sympy` test suite to ensure that the new feature works correctly.\n\nRemember to follow the contribution guidelines of the `sympy` project if you plan to submit this feature as a pull request.\n\n### Code snippets to check\n\n-  \u2192 [sympy](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/tree//sympy) \u2192 [ntheory](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/tree//sympy/ntheory)- [Lines 540 - 2581](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/blob//sympy/ntheory/factor_.py#L540-L2581)\n\n This snippet contains the definition and documentation for the `factorint` function, which is directly related to the issue as it describes the current behavior that the user wants to be enhanced. \n\n\n   - [Lines 1453 - 1797](https://github.com/testbed/sympy__sympy__1.0/blob//sympy/ntheory/factor_.py#L1453-L1797)\n\n This snippet shows the `primefactors` function which returns a list of prime factors without multiplicity.

For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import factorint\n    >>> factorint(2000)    # 2000 = (2**4) * (5**3)\n    {2: 4, 5: 3}\n    >>> factorint(65537)   # This number is prime\n    {65537: 1}\n\n    For input less than 2, factorint behaves as follows:\n\n        - ``factorint(1)`` returns the empty factorization, ``{}``\n        - ``factorint(0)`` returns ``{0:1}``\n        - ``factorint(-n)`` adds ``-1:1`` to the factors and then factors ``n``\n\n    Partial Factorization:\n\n    If ``limit`` (> 3) is specified, the search is stopped after performing\n    trial division up to (and including) the limit (or taking a\n    corresponding number of rho/p-1 steps). This is useful if one has\n    a large number and only is interested in finding small factors (if\n    any). Note that setting a limit does not prevent larger factors\n    from being found early; it simply means that the largest factor may\n    be composite. Since checking for perfect power is relatively cheap, it is\n    done regardless of the limit setting.\n\n    This number, for example, has two small factors and a huge\n    semi-prime factor that cannot be reduced easily:\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import isprime\n    >>> a = 1407633717262338957430697921446883\n    >>> f = factorint(a, limit=10000)\n    >>> f == {991: 1, int(202916782076162456022877024859): 1, 7: 1}\n    True\n    >>> isprime(max(f))\n    False\n\n    This number has a small factor and a residual perfect power whose\n    base is greater than the limit:\n\n    >>> factorint(3*101**7, limit=5)\n    {3: 1, 101: 7}\n\n    List of Factors:\n\n    If ``multiple`` is set to ``True`` then a list containing the\n    prime factors including multiplicities is returned.\n\n    >>> factorint(24, multiple=True)\n    [2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    Visual Factorization:\n\n    If ``visual`` is set to ``True``, then it will return a visual\n    factorization of the integer.  For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import pprint\n    >>> pprint(factorint(4200, visual=True))\n     3  1  2  1\n    2 *3 *5 *7\n\n    Note that this is achieved by using the evaluate=False flag in Mul\n    and Pow. If you do other manipulations with an expression where\n    evaluate=False, it may evaluate.  Therefore, you should use the\n    visual option only for visualization, and use the normal dictionary\n    returned by visual=False if you want to perform operations on the\n    factors.\n\n    You can easily switch between the two forms by sending them back to\n    factorint:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Mul, Pow\n    >>> regular = factorint(1764); regular\n    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}\n    >>> pprint(factorint(regular))\n     2  2  2\n    2 *3 *7\n\n    >>> visual = factorint(1764, visual=True); pprint(visual)\n     2  2  2\n    2 *3 *7\n    >>> print(factorint(visual))\n    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}\n\n    If you want to send a number to be factored in a partially factored form\n    you can do so with a dictionary or unevaluated expression:\n\n    >>> factorint(factorint({4: 2, 12: 3})) # twice to toggle to dict form\n    {2: 10, 3: 3}\n    >>> factorint(Mul(4, 12, evaluate=False))\n    {2: 4, 3: 1}\n\n    The table of the output logic is:\n\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n                       Visual\n        ------ ----------------------\n        Input  True   False   other\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n        dict    mul    dict    mul\n        n       mul    dict    dict\n        mul     mul    dict    dict\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    The function switches between multiple algorithms.

For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import factorint\n    >>> factorint(2000)    # 2000 = (2**4) * (5**3)\n    {2: 4, 5: 3}\n    >>> factorint(65537)   # This number is prime\n    {65537: 1}\n\n    For input less than 2, factorint behaves as follows:\n\n        - ``factorint(1)`` returns the empty factorization, ``{}``\n        - ``factorint(0)`` returns ``{0:1}``\n        - ``factorint(-n)`` adds ``-1:1`` to the factors and then factors ``n``\n\n    Partial Factorization:\n\n    If ``limit`` (> 3) is specified, the search is stopped after performing\n    trial division up to (and including) the limit (or taking a\n    corresponding number of rho/p-1 steps). This is useful if one has\n    a large number and only is interested in finding small factors (if\n    any). Note that setting a limit does not prevent larger factors\n    from being found early; it simply means that the largest factor may\n    be composite. Since checking for perfect power is relatively cheap, it is\n    done regardless of the limit setting.\n\n    This number, for example, has two small factors and a huge\n    semi-prime factor that cannot be reduced easily:\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory import isprime\n    >>> a = 1407633717262338957430697921446883\n    >>> f = factorint(a, limit=10000)\n    >>> f == {991: 1, int(202916782076162456022877024859): 1, 7: 1}\n    True\n    >>> isprime(max(f))\n    False\n\n    This number has a small factor and a residual perfect power whose\n    base is greater than the limit:\n\n    >>> factorint(3*101**7, limit=5)\n    {3: 1, 101: 7}\n\n    List of Factors:\n\n    If ``multiple`` is set to ``True`` then a list containing the\n    prime factors including multiplicities is returned.\n\n    >>> factorint(24, multiple=True)\n    [2, 2, 2, 3]\n\n    Visual Factorization:\n\n    If ``visual`` is set to ``True``, then it will return a visual\n    factorization of the integer.  For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import pprint\n    >>> pprint(factorint(4200, visual=True))\n     3  1  2  1\n    2 *3 *5 *7\n\n    Note that this is achieved by using the evaluate=False flag in Mul\n    and Pow. If you do other manipulations with an expression where\n    evaluate=False, it may evaluate.  Therefore, you should use the\n    visual option only for visualization, and use the normal dictionary\n    returned by visual=False if you want to perform operations on the\n    factors.\n\n    You can easily switch between the two forms by sending them back to\n    factorint:\n\n    >>> from sympy import Mul, Pow\n    >>> regular = factorint(1764); regular\n    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}\n    >>> pprint(factorint(regular))\n     2  2  2\n    2 *3 *7\n\n    >>> visual = factorint(1764, visual=True); pprint(visual)\n     2  2  2\n    2 *3 *7\n    >>> print(factorint(visual))\n    {2: 2, 3: 2, 7: 2}\n\n    If you want to send a number to be factored in a partially factored form\n    you can do so with a dictionary or unevaluated expression:\n\n    >>> factorint(factorint({4: 2, 12: 3})) # twice to toggle to dict form\n    {2: 10, 3: 3}\n    >>> factorint(Mul(4, 12, evaluate=False))\n    {2: 4, 3: 1}\n\n    The table of the output logic is:\n\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n                       Visual\n        ------ ----------------------\n        Input  True   False   other\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n        dict    mul    dict    mul\n        n       mul    dict    dict\n        mul     mul    dict    dict\n        ====== ====== ======= =======\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    Algorithm:\n\n    The function switches between multiple algorithms. Trial division\n    quickly finds small factors (of the order 1-5 digits), and finds\n    all large factors if given enough time. The Pollard rho and p-1\n    algorithms are used to find large factors ahead of time; they\n    will often find factors of the order of 10 digits within a few\n    seconds:\n\n    >>> factors = factorint(12345678910111213141516)\n    >>> for base, exp in sorted(factors.items()):\n    ...     print('%s %s' % (base, exp))\n    ...\n    2 2\n    2507191691 1\n    1231026625769 1\n\n    Any of these methods can optionally be disabled with the following\n    boolean parameters:\n\n        - ``use_trial``: Toggle use of trial division\n        - ``use_rho``: Toggle use of Pollard's rho method\n        - ``use_pm1``: Toggle use of Pollard's p-1 method\n\n    ``factorint`` also periodically checks if the remaining part is\n    a prime number or a perfect power, and in those cases stops.\n\n    For unevaluated factorial, it uses Legendre's formula(theorem).\n\n\n    If ``verbose`` is set to ``True``, detailed progress is printed.\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    smoothness, smoothness_p, divisors\n\n    \"\"\"",
