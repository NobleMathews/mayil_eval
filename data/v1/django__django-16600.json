    "body": "Description\n\t\nChangeset 278881e37619278789942513916acafaa88d26f3 introduced a regression. Aggregate queries are rejected by the database due to the aggregated field being added to the GROUP BY clause.\nIt was difficult for me to pin down, especially because it looks like the error only occurs on the second evaluation of the query. The first query is executed just fine and doesn't contain the position reference to the aggregated field in the GROUP BY, only the second one. Below is a test to reproduce the behaviour:\ntests/aggregation_regress/tests.py\ndiff --git a/tests/aggregation_regress/tests.py b/tests/aggregation_regress/tests.py\nindex bfb3919b23..05122db956 100644\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t a\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t b\n\t\t\t\t \n class AggregationTests(TestCase):\u00a0\n13211321\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lambda b: (b.name, b.authorCount),\n13221322\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 )\n13231323\n\u00a01324\u00a0 \u00a0 def test_quoting_aggregate_order_by_f(self):\n\u00a01325\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 author = Author.objects.get(name=\"Peter Norvig\")\n\u00a01326\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 qs = (\n\u00a01327\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 author.book_set.all()\n\u00a01328\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 .annotate(num=Count(\"authors\"))\n\u00a01329\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 .order_by(F(\"num\").desc())\n\u00a01330\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 )\n\u00a01331\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 list(qs.iterator())\n\u00a01332\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 list(qs.iterator())\n\u00a01333\n13241334\u00a0 \u00a0 def test_stddev(self):\n13251335\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 self.assertEqual(\n13261336\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Book.objects.aggregate(StdDev(\"pages\")),\n",
